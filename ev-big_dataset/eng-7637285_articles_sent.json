As a result, at least 57 civilians were killed, dozens more were injured.\n\nAccording to the traditional scenario, immediately after the incident, the Ukrainian authorities sent foreign reporters to the town. However, this time the plan went wrong. The journalists filmed the serial number of the Tochka-U missile which killed dozens of civilians. They left no doubts that the missile was launched by the AFU.\n\nThe Tochka-U missile in Kramatorsk has a series number Sh91579:\n\nThe Tochka-U missiles, including of the Sh915 series, are actively used by the AFU on the Donbass front lines. The following cases of the strikes with missiles of the same series have been recorded so far:\n\nThese are only cases confirmed by the footage from the area and which proved the use of the Tochka-U missiles of the SH-915 series only.\n\nAnother example was the Tochka-U missile that hit Avdiivka which is under the control of the AFU on March 11, 2022. The fact that the series number was blurred by the National Police of Ukraine confirms that this was not Russian but Ukrainian missile. There would be no need to hide the number if it was the Russian missile.\n\nThis is yet another evidence that on April 8, 2022, the AFU intentionally killed dozens of civilians who were trying to leave the town of Kramatorsk, amassing in the railway station. Moreover, the day before, the local authorities called on the citizens to leave Kramatorsk as soon as possible. Thus, this was a planned provocation by the Kiev regime. They called as many civilians to the station as possible right before the attack.\n\nThe same scenario of the bloody attack on civilians was used on the morning of March 14, when Ukrainian units struck the center of Donetsk with a Tochka-U tactical missile equipped with cluster munitions, killing dozens of civilians as well.\n\nToday, the Kiev regime continues to spread lies that the Tochka-U which hit the station in Kramatorsk was Russian, or Belorussian, or even that it was the only Russian Tochka-U brought to Ukraine by a special order to hit the train station. Kiev had to invent new stories, because the Russian military has not used Tochka-U missiles for many years.\n\nAnother mistake of the Kiev propaganda revealed the truth.\n\nfrom https://southfront.org/last-point-in-kievs-lies-about-bloody-attack-on-civilians-with-tochka-u-missile/", "source": {"uri": "therussophile.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheRussophiles"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/therussophile.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Kr-1-490x268-1.jpg?fit=490%2C268&ssl=1", "eventUri": "eng-7637285", "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 15, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 22, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7000915819", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-12", "time": "12:33:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-12T12:33:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-12T12:16:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "url": "https://www.globalresearch.ca/evidence-missile-caused-massacre-kramatorsk-not-russian-but-ukrainian/5777254", "title": "Evidence that the Missile that Caused the Massacre in Kramatorsk Is Not Russian but Ukrainian - Global Research", "body": "All Global Research articles can be read in 51 languages by activating the \"Translate Website\" drop down menu on the top banner of our home page (Desktop version).\n\nTo receive Global Research's Daily Newsletter (selected articles), click here.\n\nVisit and follow us on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.
