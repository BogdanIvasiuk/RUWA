Russia's defence ministry has not confirmed that version of events. Reuters is unable to verify either side's assertions.\n\nHere's what we do know, and what the sinking means (and does not mean) for Russia's battle-readiness:\n\nWHAT CAPABILITIES DOES THE SINKING DEPRIVE RUSSIA OF?\n\nRussia has powerful air defence systems deployed in Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, but the Moskva was able to provide long-range and mobile air defence protection for the entire Black Sea Fleet and was a floating command and control centre. Its loss potentially leaves the fleet more exposed, particularly on longer range missions west of Crimea.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED TO THE CREW?\n\nThe ship had a crew of around 500 sailors who Russia said were successfully evacuated to other ships before being returned to their home port of Sevastopol in Crimea on Friday. Ukraine has suggested there are likely to have been fatalities, but Russia has not said anything on the subject yet.\n\nWILL IT LOSS CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE UKRAINE CONFLICT?\n\nProbably not, but Britain's Ministry of Defence says its loss is likely to prompt Russia to review its naval posture in the Black Sea. While a huge blow to Russian military morale, the Russian navy has so far not played a big role in what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. Russia retains naval dominance in the immediate region and the Moskva was primarily equipped to destroy enemy vessels at sea but little is left of Ukraine's navy.\n\nWAS IT EARMARKED FOR A ROLE IN THE UNFOLDING CONFLICT?\n\nNot clear, but some analysts say it may have helped support a possible Russian amphibious landing in the Ukrainian port of Odesa that has not happened yet because of resistance from Ukrainian forces. Its sinking may be seen in some quarters in Ukraine as reducing the chances of such an assault and allow Ukraine to redeploy some of its forces elsewhere.\n\nCAN RUSSIA EASILY REPLACE THE MOSKVA'S CAPABILITIES\n\nNo. Russia has two other ships of the same class, the Marshal Ustinov and the Varyag, which serve with Russia's Northern and Pacific fleets respectively. Turkey, which controls access to the Black Sea via the Bosphorus, will not let them enter at a time of war.\n\nWAS THE MOSKVA ARMED WITH UNIQUE WEAPONS?\n\nNo. It had anti-ship missiles and surface-to-air missiles, but was not equipped with Russia's latest generation Kalibr cruise missiles or hypersonic missiles.\n\nHOW MODERN A SHIP WAS IT?\n\nNot very. Designed in the 1970s Soviet Union during the Cold War, it was conceived to destroy U.S. aircraft carriers and had been in service for nearly four decades. It underwent an extensive refit, and according to Britain's Ministry of Defence, only returned to operational status in 2021. Despite that refit, some of its hardware remained outdated.\n\nHOW BIG A BLOW TO RUSSIAN MILITARY PRIDE IS THE SINKING?\n\nIt's a bitter loss for the Russian military as the ship, though ageing, was a symbol of the Crimea-based Black Sea Fleet and of Russian military pride. If it was holed by Ukrainian anti-ship missiles, it would be the biggest Russian warship to be lost in action since 1941, when German dive bombers crippled the Soviet battleship Marat in Kronshtadt harbour.

Ukraine has suggested there are likely to have been fatalities, but Russia has not said anything on the subject yet.\n\nUnlikely to, but Britain's Ministry of Defence says its loss is likely to prompt Russia to review its naval posture in the Black Sea. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that while the sinking would have a symbolic impact and potentially raise questions about Russia's longer-term naval capabilities, it would be unlikely to have a major impact on the course of the conflict. The Russian navy has so far not played a big role.\n\nOne U.S. official said that Russia had only used its warships in a limited fashion, to carry out occasional strikes and resupply troops in the south. Russia retains naval dominance in the immediate region and the Moskva was equipped to destroy enemy vessels at sea but little is left of Ukraine's navy.\n\nYes it will, but that change is not seen as being hugely significant. After the fire on the Moskva started, which U.S. officials believe was likely a Ukrainian attack, about five Russian warships in the northern part of the Black Sea moved further away from the coast, about 80 nautical miles. But U.S. officials said they believed those ships were still capable of carrying out strikes into Ukraine from that distance and were less likely to be targeted by the Ukrainians that far away from the coast. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, said the Ukrainian military's ability to hit Russian warships in the Black Sea could force the Russian Navy to deploy additional air defence and other assets for protection.\n\nRead more: CIA chief says China is Russia's partner in Ukraine War\n\nNot clear, but some analysts say it may have helped support a possible Russian amphibious landing in the Ukrainian port of Odesa that has not happened yet because of resistance from Ukrainian forces.

Reuters is unable to verify either side's assertions.\n\nHere's what we do know, and what the sinking means (and does not mean) for Russia's battle-readiness:\n\nWHAT CAPABILITIES DOES THE SINKING DEPRIVE RUSSIA OF?\n\nRussia has powerful air defence systems deployed in Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, but the Moskva was able to provide long-range and mobile air defence protection for the entire Black Sea Fleet and was a floating command and control centre. Its loss degrades the fleet's air defences, particularly on longer range missions.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED TO THE CREW?\n\nThe ship had a crew of around 500 sailors who Russia said were successfully evacuated to other ships before being returned to their home port of Sevastopol in Crimea on Friday. Ukraine has suggested there are likely to have been fatalities, but Russia has not said anything on the subject yet.\n\nWILL IT LOSS CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE UKRAINE CONFLICT?\n\nUnlikely to, but Britain's Ministry of Defence says its loss is likely to prompt Russia to review its naval posture in the Black Sea. US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that while the sinking would have a symbolic impact and potentially raise questions about Russia's longer-term naval capabilities, it would be unlikely to have a major impact on the course of the conflict. The Russian navy has so far not played a big role.\n\nOne US official said that Russia had only used its warships in a limited fashion, to carry out occasional strikes and resupply troops in the south. Russia retains naval dominance in the immediate region and the Moskva was equipped to destroy enemy vessels at sea but little is left of Ukraine's navy.\n\nWILL RUSSIA'S NAVY NOW CHANGE THE WAY IT OPERATES AND DOES THAT MATTER?\n\nYes it will, but that change is not seen as being hugely significant. After the fire on the Moskva started, which US officials believe was likely a Ukrainian attack, about five Russian warships in the northern part of the Black Sea moved further away from the coast, about 80 nautical miles. But US officials said they believed those ships were still capable of carrying out strikes into Ukraine from that distance and were less likely to be targeted by the Ukrainians that far away from the coast. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, said the Ukrainian military's ability to hit Russian warships in the Black Sea could force the Russian Navy to deploy additional air defence and other assets for protection.\n\nWAS THE MOSKVA EARMARKED FOR A ROLE IN THE UNFOLDING CONFLICT?\n\nNot clear, but some analysts say it may have helped support a possible Russian amphibious landing in the Ukrainian port of Odesa that has not happened yet because of resistance from Ukrainian forces. Its sinking may be seen in some quarters in Ukraine as reducing the chances of such an assault and allow Ukraine to redeploy some of its forces elsewhere.\n\nCAN RUSSIA EASILY REPLACE THE MOSKVA'S CAPABILITIES\n\nNo. Russia has two other ships of the same class, the Marshal Ustinov and the Varyag, which serve with Russia's Northern and Pacific fleets respectively. Turkey, which controls access to the Black Sea via the Bosphorus, will not let them enter at a time of war.\n\nWAS THE MOSKVA ARMED WITH UNIQUE WEAPONS?\n\nNo. It had anti-ship missiles and surface-to-air missiles, but was not equipped with Russia's latest generation Kalibr cruise missiles or hypersonic missiles.\n\nHOW MODERN A SHIP WAS IT?\n\nNot very. Designed in the 1970s Soviet Union during the Cold War, it was conceived to destroy US aircraft carriers and had been in service for nearly four decades. It underwent an extensive refit, and according to Britain's Ministry of Defence, only returned to operational status in 2021. Despite that refit, some of its hardware remained outdated.\n\nHOW BIG A BLOW TO RUSSIAN MILITARY PRIDE IS THE SINKING?\n\nIt's a bitter loss for the Russian military as the ship, though ageing, was a symbol of the Crimea-based Black Sea Fleet and of Russian military pride. If it was holed by Ukrainian anti-ship missiles, it would be the biggest Russian warship to be lost in action since 1941, when German dive bombers crippled the Soviet battleship Marat in Kronshtadt harbour.

Russia's defence ministry has not confirmed that version of events.

Russia has two other ships of the same class, the Marshal Ustinov and the Varyag, which serve with Russia's Northern and Pacific fleets respectively.\n\nThe ships were designed in the Soviet Union in the late 1970s to counter US aircraft carrier groups and to provide air defence to Soviet vessels operating in distant oceans. They were nicknamed \"carrier killers\" at the time.\n\nThe ship had a crew of around 500 sailors who Russia said were successfully evacuated to other ships before being returned to their home port of Sevastopol in Crimea on Friday.

Its loss doubtlessly leaves the fleet extra uncovered, notably on longer vary missions west of Crimea.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED TO THE CREW?\n\nThe ship had a crew of round 500 sailors who Russia mentioned have been efficiently evacuated to different ships earlier than being returned to their residence port of Sevastopol in Crimea on Friday.

While a big blow to Russian army morale, the Russian navy has to this point not performed a big function in what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. Russia retains naval dominance in the rapid area and the Moskva was primarily outfitted to destroy enemy vessels at sea however little is left of Ukraine's navy.\n\nWAS IT EARMARKED FOR A ROLE IN THE UNFOLDING CONFLICT?\n\nNot clear, however some analysts say it could have helped assist a potential Russian amphibious touchdown in the Ukrainian port of Odesa that has not occurred but as a result of of resistance from Ukrainian forces. Its sinking could also be seen in some quarters in Ukraine as lowering the probabilities of such an assault and permit Ukraine to redeploy some of its forces elsewhere.\n\nCAN RUSSIA EASILY REPLACE THE MOSKVA'S CAPABILITIES\n\nNo. Russia has two different ships of the similar class, the Marshal Ustinov and the Varyag, which serve with Russia's Northern and Pacific fleets respectively. Turkey, which controls entry to the Black Sea by way of the Bosphorus, won't allow them to enter at a time of conflict.\n\nWAS THE MOSKVA ARMED WITH UNIQUE WEAPONS?\n\nNo. It had anti-ship missiles and surface-to-air missiles, however was not outfitted with Russia's newest era Kalibr cruise missiles or hypersonic missiles.\n\nHOW MODERN A SHIP WAS IT?\n\nNot very. Designed in the Seventies Soviet Union throughout the Cold War, it was conceived to destroy U.S. plane carriers and had been in service for practically 4 many years.

They said the warship sunk while being towed to port, following a fire onboard, which involved ammunition stored in the hull.\n\nIn any case, the Moskva is now out of action - for good. But what impact, if any, will this have on the war in Ukraine?\n\nThe Moskva, equipped with surface-to-air missiles, provided long-range and mobile air defence for the whole of Russia's fleet in the Black Sea. It protected cruisers, frigates, missile corvettes and amphibious landing ships capable of carrying thousands of troops.\n\nWithout the Moskva's defensive firepower, this fleet will be more vulnerable to attack, especially from the Ukrainian Air Force.\n\nNevertheless, Russia has powerful air defence systems deployed in Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. These can defend the fleet against attack as it operates in the area.\n\nRussia will not be able to replace the capabilities of the Moskva any time soon. It only has two other ships of the same class - the Marshal Ustinov and the Varyag - which serve with Russia's Northern and Pacific fleets respectively.\n\nTo reach the Ukrainian theatre, both would need to pass through the Bosphorus into the Black Sea. The waterway between Istanbul is controlled by Turkey, which says it will not let warships from any state pass through.\n\n\"When Turkey is not a belligerent in the conflict, it has the authority to restrict the passage of the warring states' warships across the straits,\" Mevlut Cavusoglu, Foreign Minister of Turkey, said in February.\n\nThe Moskva was old and outdated. Designed in the 1970s during the Cold War, it was built to destroy US aircraft carriers and had been on the waves for nearly four decades.\n\nAlthough the warship had undergone an extensive re-fit, returning to operational status in 2021, some of its hardware remained outdated, according to Britain's Ministry of Defence.\n\nSome 500 Russian sailors were crewed on the Moskva when the blaze broke out. Although Russia successfully evacuated many onboard the ship to the port of Sevastopol in Crimea, Ukraine has suggested there were likely to have been fatalities.\n\nNeither Russia nor the US has commented on the number of possible casualties or if there are any at all.\n\nThe loss of Russia's flagship is a bitter blow for Russia, and embarrassing internationally. Although old, it was a symbol of Russia's dominance in the sea and of the country's military prowess.\n\nIf the ship was destroyed by a Ukrainian missile as both Ukraine and the US claim, it would be the biggest Russian warship to be lost since World War Two, when German bombers crippled the Soviet battleship Marat in Kronshtadt harbour.\n\nThe sight of the Russian ship sinking \"is a major propaganda victory\" for Ukraine, said an ISW assessment. Western diplomats and experts suspect heads will roll in Moscow over the loss of the ship.\n\nAnalysts have suggested that the Moskva was going to play a role in a potential Russian amphibious assault of the Ukrainian port of Odea, which had not yet happened due to resistance from Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe odds of this taking place are now seen as lower in some quarters, and this could allow Ukraine to redeploy some of its troops elsewhere.\n\nYet this is only one train of thought. The extent to which this was Russia's plan is not clear.\n\nThe war in Ukraine is primarily a ground war. The seas have so far not played a big role in the conflict.\n\nUS officials have said that, while the sinking of the Moskva will have a symbolic impact, potentially boosting Ukrainian morale at the expense of Russia's, it will not have a major impact on the course of the conflict.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters, one US official added that Russia had only used the ship on limited occasions, such as resupplying troops in the south and carrying out occasional strikes.\n\nYet Britain's Ministry of Defence has said the loss will likely cause Russia to review its naval posture in the Black Sea.\n\nAfter the alleged missile strike, Russia's ships pulled further away from the Ukrainian coastline by about 80 nautical miles, although at this distance they can still strike Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/06/62/16/64/1000x563_cmsv2_b367dd85-951f-5667-b3fc-648295986d5c-6621664.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7641614", "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 15, "stanza_neu": 23, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 38, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7008000803", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-18", "time": "12:46:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-18T12:46:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-18T12:37:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6313725709915161, "url": "https://themoderatevoice.com/ukraine-sinks-putins-pride-and-joy-truth-and-consequences/", "title": "Ukraine Sinks Putin's Pride and Joy: Truth and Consequences - The Moderate Voice", "body": "While the stories on how it happened vary widely, the end result remains the same.\n\nThe 12,500-ton guided missile cruiser Moskva, the pride and the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, named after the Russian capital, now rests ingloriously at the bottom of the Black Sea along with its missiles and weaponry that would have been used against Ukraine and its people.\n\nWhile even the number of lives lost is being obfuscated by the Russians, it is hoped not too many of its crew - normally about 500 sailors -- went down with the ship.\n\nThe 612 feet long Moskva, originally christened Slava, or \"Glory,\" sank Thursday, reportedly in a storm as it was being towed to a port in Crimea for repairs.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian officials and confirmed by the Pentagon and others, Ukrainian forces had struck the Moskva with two RK-360 Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles one day earlier causing \"serious damage.\" The truck-mounted Neptune missiles can hit targets up to 175 miles away. Sailing about 70 miles south of Odessa, the Moskva was well within that range when it was struck.\n\nThe Russians claim an accidental fire broke out aboard the Moskva causing an ammunition explosion.\n\nThe whole truth about the Moskva's demise will eventually be known. For now, it depends on whom one believes. The reputable Institute for the Study of War (ISW) writes, Ukrainian forces \"likely have the capability\" to have hit the Moskva. It adds, \"Both explanations for the sinking of the Moskva indicate possible Russian deficiencies -- either poor air defenses or incredibly lax safety procedures and damage control on the Black Sea Fleet's flagship.\"\n\nRegardless of the specific circumstances, the loss of the Moskva is a major symbolic victory and morale booster for Ukraine and a major embarrassment and a bitter loss for Russia, in particular for Putin.\n\nMany will remember that this was the same vessel that, during the early days of the Russian invasion, demanded that Ukrainian border guards stationed on Snake Island surrender. The famous response, \"Russian warship go f*ck yourself\" has now been immortalized on a Ukraine postage stamp issued (one million of them) by Ukraine's national postal service the day before the attack on the Moskva.\n\nIt certainly is what the Military Times calls, \"a devastating symbolic defeat for Moscow,\" especially as Russia retreats from the north and regroups for a major, renewed offensive in eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\nPatrick Conin at the Hudson Institute calls the loss of the Moskva, regardless of the cause, \"a symbol of Putin's disastrous strategic gamble on war\" with Ukraine.\n\nKatarzyna Zysk, a professor at the Norwegian Institute for Defense Studies in Oslo, puts it this way:\n\nLosing the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet is like losing a crown jewel: a serious prestige damage, which, I believe, has likely hit Putin personally given how much importance he has attached to rebuilding Russia as a naval great power.\n\nBut more than symbolic and more than just a blow to Putin's prestige, it is a real and sizeable loss in Russian naval capabilities at a critical time in its war on Ukraine.\n\nThe loss of the Moskva, armed with multiple cruise missiles, anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, and the only ship of its class in the Black Sea significantly reduces the Russian navy's firepower in that strategic body of water.\n\nThe two other Russian missile cruisers - the Marshal Ustinov and the Varyag - are deployed with Russia's Northern and Pacific fleets respectively, and it would be difficult for Russia to quickly sail them into the Black Sea. Additionally, Turkey has said it will not allow ships into the Black Sea that don't have a homeport there.\n\nIn addition to its mission as a powerful, stand-off guided missile cruiser, the Moskva served a key role as both a command and control ship and in providing critical \"area air defence cover to naval assets as well as shore bombardment and land attack.\" It would have played an important role in what may be next on Putin's mind: An amphibious assault on the key coastal city of Odesa, Ukraine's third largest city and Putin's much sought-after prize. \"While other landing ships would have been used to bring Russian naval infantry to the coastline, the Moskva would have protected those ships and launched missile strikes on the city,\" writes the New York Times.\n\nWhile, prior to the Moskva attack, Russian warships were operating in the Black Sea with relative impunity, the loss may force the Russians to move its vessels further away from the reach of the Neptune missiles and to deploy additional point and air defense assets to the Black Sea\n\nThe loss of the Moskva, the largest warship lost in combat since World War II, may not significantly alter the course of the war but it may provoke a humiliated, vengeful, backed-into-a-corner Putin to commit even more desperate acts of aggression and horrific atrocities on all fronts.\n\nJust one day after the sinking of the Moskva, Russia's Defense Minister promised \"to ramp up missile attacks on the Ukrainian capital.\"\n\nOn Friday, perhaps tacitly acknowledging the fact that Neptune missiles had hit the Moskva, the Russians targeted munitions and armament factories in Kyiv seriously damaging the Vizar factory on the edge of the city, reportedly the plant involved in the production of the Neptune missile. The Neptune missile, based on an old Soviet cruise missile was developed by the Luch Design Bureau also located in Kyiv. Lviv and Kharkiv were also bombed and struck by missiles, respectively.\n\nAlso on Friday, and while still denying that the Moskva had been attacked, Russia's Defense Ministry warned it will increase strikes in retaliation for hits on Moscow's assets.\n\nBefore the Moskva attack, Russia had already formally warned the United States and NATO of \"unpredictable consequences\" if shipments of advanced weaponry to Ukraine continued -- shipments that were \"adding fuel' to the conflict.\"\n\nEven more foreboding, on Friday, Ukraine President Zelensky warned that Russia might even use (tactical) nuclear weapons out of desperation. A sentiment that has been previously echoed by others, including CIA director William Burns, who said in public remarks at Georgia Tech on Thursday:\n\nGiven the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they've faced so far militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low yield nuclear weapons.\n\nWhile the sinking of the Moskva is a clear victory for Ukraine and ignominy for Russia, no one knows how it will alter the course of this unprovoked war for, while the truth is known, the consequences have yet to play out.\n\nIn his \"Ukraine's Sinking of the Moskva Encapsulates the War - but Won't Decide It,\" Anshel Pfeffer at Haaretz perhaps expresses our hopes and fears best.\n\n\"After 50 days of war, the morale boost for the Ukrainians in striking such a major symbol of Russian military power is immense. The next 50 days will bring new challenges, though,\" he writes.", "source": {"uri": "themoderatevoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Moderate Voice"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dorian_de_wind@themoderatevoice.com", "name": "Dorian De Wind", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://themoderatevoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Moskva.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7641614", "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 17, "stanza_neu": 20, "stanza_pos": 5, "swn_neg": 42, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7005785188", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-16", "time": "06:55:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-16T06:55:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-16T06:54:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6196078658103943, "url": "https://www.deccanherald.com/international/world-news-politics/why-the-black-sea-is-important-for-russia-1101241.html", "title": "Why the Black Sea is important for Russia", "body": "The sinking of the Moskva doesn't mean much for Russia's naval strategy, experts believe, but it cannot deploy a replacement in the region\n\nThe loss of the guided missile cruiser Moskva, which sank in the Black Sea -- by either Ukrainian missiles or a fire on board, depending on who's talking -- is a major loss for Russia amid its 50-day-long invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe ship's sinking marks a major turn in the war, hitting Russia both in terms of its military superiority and troop morale, while propping up the Ukrainian defence's hopes of an unlikely victory. It was also the most significant combat loss for any navy since 1982, when Argentina's air force sank a British guided missile destroyer and other ships during the Falklands War.\n\nWhere is the Black Sea?\n\nThe Black Sea is located between Europe and Asia, flanked by Turkey in the south, Russia-annexed Crimea in the north, Georgia and Russia in the east and Romania and Bulgaria in the west.\n\nOne of the smaller seas in the world, the near-oval-shaped Black Sea is, however, linked to the Atlantic Ocean through the Bosporus Strait, which divides Istanbul (and Turkey) into the European and Asian side, and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe sea also houses the port of Sevastopol, a key piece of Russian military infrastructure that it acquired when it annexed Crimea in 2014 from Ukraine.\n\nImportance of Black Sea for Russia\n\nFor Russia, the Black Sea is an entry point into the Mediterranean and a buffer between NATO and itself. It also serves to secure Russia's economic gateway to major markets in southern Europe.\n\nMilitarily, the Black Sea plays a key role in Russia's campaign in Ukraine, as its Black Sea Fleet has been blockading the besieged port city of Mariupol. It comprises Russian vessels in the Black Sea proper, the Sea of Azov and the Mediterranean.\n\nComplete domination of the Black Sea and Sea of Azov is a key part of Russia's campaign, as it would give Russia a major leg-up in the Crimea-Odesa-Mariupol region, given that Sevastopol is already under its command.\n\nAs of April 15, Russia claims to have great control over Mariupol, but Ukrainian forces continued to remain holed up in a desperate resistance. Should it gain control over the city and Odesa, it would have near-total control over Ukraine's coastline, cutting it off from critical trade and defence supply chains.\n\nWhat does Moskva's loss mean to Russia\n\nWhile the sinking of the Moskva is considered a huge blow to Russia, experts are more on the fence. Officials believe that it will not have a hugely significant impact on Russia's plans on the Ukrainian coast.\n\nAfter the fire on the Moskva started, which US officials believe was likely a Ukrainian attack, about five Russian warships in the northern part of the Black Sea moved further away from the coast, about 80 nautical miles. But US officials said they believed those ships were still capable of carrying out strikes into Ukraine from that distance and were less likely to be targeted by the Ukrainians that far away from the coast.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, said the Ukrainian military's ability to hit Russian warships in the Black Sea could force the Russian Navy to deploy additional air defence and other assets for protection.\n\nHowever, while Russia does have two other ships in the same class as Moskva, neither of them can be deployed in Ukraine, as Turkey, which controls access to the Black Sea via the Bosphorus, will not let them enter at a time of war.", "source": {"uri": "deccanherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Herald"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.deccanherald.com/sites/dh/files/styles/largehorizontal/public/articleimages/2022/04/16/moskva-reuters-1101241-1650091209.jpg?itok=h3i65DBM", "eventUri": "eng-7641614", "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 6, "stanza_neu": 17, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 23, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7008769696", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-19", "time": "04:58:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-19T04:58:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-19T03:30:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russias-flagship-sinks-biggest-setback-to-putin-hot-mic-with-nidhi-razdan-2898297", "title": "Russia's Flagship Sinks: Biggest Setback To Putin? - 'Hot Mic' With Nidhi Razdan", "body": "Russia Ukraine War: Russia has suffered a series of military setbacks in recent weeks. The biggest was the sinking of the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet, the Moskva. But how much does it actually hurt Putin?\n\nHi,\n\nThis is Hot Mic and I'm Nidhi Razdan.\n\nIt's been more than 50 days since Russia invaded Ukraine. Vladimir Putin believed he would get Kyiv to surrender within five days Things clearly have not quite turned out the way he had hoped. Russia has suffered a series of military setbacks in recent weeks. The biggest was the sinking of its flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, the Moskva, last week, which now lies at the bottom of the sea. The 600-foot, 12,500-tonne vessel is by no means small. Ukraine says that it destroyed the ship with its state-of-the-art Neptune missiles. Russia, however, claims that the vessel went down because of a fire on board, which involved ammunition stored in the hull. Either way, the sinking of the Moskva is a significant event. Equipped with surface-to-air missiles, the ship provided long-range and mobile air defence for all of Russia's fleet in the Black Sea.\n\nThis includes Russian cruisers, frigates, missile corvettes and amphibious landing ships capable of carrying thousands of troops. This entire fleet is now more vulnerable to an attack without the protective cover and firepower of the Moskva. Around 500 Russian sailors were on board the Moskva, and most are believed to have been safely evacuated by the Russians. Neither Russia nor the Americans have commented on the number of possible casualties on board, or if there are any at all. If indeed the Ukrainians did manage to strike the ship with their missiles, it would be a huge blow to Russia. At least symbolically, if nothing else.\n\nThe sinking is an embarrassment to the mighty Russians, especially at a time when the morale of its troops has reportedly been low, and Ukraine has scored a major propaganda point. Ukraine's Defence Ministry, meanwhile, has claimed that it's killed about 20,000 Russian soldiers and officers of the Russian army. A claim, that has not been independently verified. A Kremlin spokesperson has acknowledged that Russia has suffered what he called \"significant losses of troops\" in Ukraine, but did not provide a specific number of casualties. The sinking of the mighty Moskva also busts the myth of invincibility of the Russian military. At the same time, it has lifted the spirit of the Ukrainians who are fighting a David versus Goliath battle. But experts are divided on whether this would make much of a military impact. So far, Russia's Navy has not really been used in the war, though there has been speculation that the Moskva was going to be used in an attack on the Ukrainian region of Odessa. Otherwise, Russia has mainly used its aircraft and land-based systems for attacks.\n\nThe Pentagon says Moscow's naval component to the war has largely been limited to two efforts - the replenishment and resupply of troops efforts in the South and some cruise missile strikes on Ukraine. But domination of the Black Sea is actually very important for Russia and this is key. It is a stepping stone, the Black Sea that is, to the Mediterranean for Russia. It's also a strategic buffer between NATO and Russia. Since 2014, Russia has been aiming to gain total control of the Black Sea since it annexed Crimea. That is why they have pushed to capture the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol in the breakaway eastern region of Donetsk Oblast. Mariupol is on the verge of falling to Russia. And that would be a significant movement forward for the Russians. Military experts say that the capture of Mariupol will give Russia control of more than 80% of the Ukrainian Black Sea coastline and cut off its maritime trade. And if the Odessa region were to fall as well, then Ukraine would lose access to its entire Black Sea coastline and would be reduced to a landlocked country. That would be devastating for its economy.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nThe loss of the Moskva ship can also propel the Russians into actually increasing their attacks on Ukraine as has been witnessed in recent days. It is also clear, however, that Russia has scaled back and changed its goalpost in the country. When they first invaded Ukraine in February, it was done from three separate directions - there was the north, the east and the south. But as the war progressed, Putin realized that he needed to cut his losses and his top officials have since said that the aim is to focus on liberating the eastern region of Donbass, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting the Ukrainian army for the past eight years or so. However, the West is also worried that a desperate Putin could use nuclear weapons. The CIA director has said recently that \"none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons.\" Tactical and low-yield nuclear weapons refer to those that are designed for use on the battlefield, of which some experts estimate that Russia has about 2,000 that can be delivered by air, naval, and ground forces. Ukraine has been aided by the West as far as its military is concerned.\n\nThe US has also announced another $800 million in military aid just last week. But President Zelensky says that he needs much more to ward off an aggressive Russian attack in the east. CNN reports that the latest aid includes 18 155mm Howitzer cannons and 40,000 artillery rounds but there is concern that this is all going to finish in a matter of days as heavy fighting intensifies in the Donbass region. Russia has also warned the State Department that there would be, what it called, \"unpredictable consequences\" if the US and its allies continue to send in heavier duty weaponry that Ukraine has sought. It is for this reason that the US has to assess how far it can go in aiding Ukraine militarily without allowing the conflict to escalate and become even bigger.", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nidhi_razdan@ndtv.com", "name": "Nidhi Razdan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-04/dorpnm6o_news_625x300_18_April_22.jpg?ver-20220417.02", "eventUri": "eng-7641614", "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 14, "stanza_neu": 40, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 55, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7005613520", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-16", "time": "01:48:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-16T01:48:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-16T01:47:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "url": "https://au.news.yahoo.com/worrying-nuclear-theory-about-cargo-on-sunken-russian-warship-014204351.html", "title": "TV host's bleak rant after Russian warship sunk: 'World War III'", "body": "It was one of the most surprising moments of the Ukraine war so far and speculation continues about the circumstances surrounding the sinking of Russia's Moskva missile cruiser warship.\n\nObservers have warned the embarrassing loss could push Putin to go nuclear, while some in the Kremlin-backed media are now banging the drum for \"World War III\".\n\nA number of Ukrainian experts have raised the possibility that the 12,500-ton cruiser - a critical military asset for the Russians - could have been carrying nuclear weapons.\n\nMykhailo Samus, deputy director of the Lyiv-based Center for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies is among those to have raised the prospect.\n\nWriting on Facebook, he said the warship could have been carrying two nuclear warheads when it was hit.\n\n\"They could have been unequipped and stored in a protected area, so most likely they were not damaged by ... explosion,\" he wrote.\n\nHowever CNN reporter Jim Sciutto that US officials do not believe the ship was carrying nuclear weapons, citing two senior officials.\n\n\"US has been monitoring Russian forces for unusual movement of nuclear weapons and has not detected such movements to date,\" he tweeted.\n\nIn an interview due to air in the United State on Sunday night, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN that \"all of the countries of the world\" should be prepared for the possibility that Putin will use tactical nuclear weapons in this ongoing war.\n\n\"We should think not be afraid, not be afraid but be ready.

It also highlights the flaws in the country's naval defensive capabilities, according to Chinese military observers.\n\nThey said that apart from the impact on the war with Ukraine, the loss of the cruiser, which was armed with anti-ship missiles, would also reduce Russia's ability to deter US carrier fleets in the Mediterranean.\n\nUkraine said it had hit the cruiser with two Neptune missiles -- a claim the United States has backed up -- but Russia blamed an ammunition explosion on board for the damage and said it sank while being towed back to port.\n\nUS officials said the strike killed an unknown number of sailors, but Russia has not confirmed any losses and insisted the crew were evacuated to other ships.\n\nYue Gang, a former colonel in the People's Liberation Army, warned against drawing hasty conclusions and said the ship had not been well-maintained over its 40 or so years in service.\n\n\"If a [Neptune] missile penetrates the deck, there will be deaths after the first explosion, but there's no report of the death of Russian crews, and I believe Russia is unlikely to cover it up,\" Yue said.\n\nIn 2018 it was taken into dock for scheduled repairs and returned to service in September 2020.\n\n\"It shows that the management is not in place, or it is possible that there were some improper operations causing the fire ... ageing electrics are also possible, showing the repair of the ship is far from satisfactory,\" he said.\n\nHowever, if it was hit by Ukraine missiles it means that there was a big gap in its air defences, which might include faults in its radar system or operations of the crew.\n\n\"Whether it was sunk by a missile strike or by the explosion itself, it is a major loss to Russia's naval strength,\" Yue said.\n\nThe loss is also a major psychological boost for the Ukrainians, especially as the ship was previously involved in a stand-off on Snake Island which became the symbol of the country's defiance after the small group of defenders told the Moskva \"Russian warship, go f*** yourself.\"\n\nThe 12,490-tonne Moskva was commissioned in 1983 under the name Slava (\"Glory\") and renamed after the Russian capital in 1996. It was armed with 16 P-1000 Vulkan anti-ship missile launchers and described as \"the most serious ship in the Black Sea\" by the former chief of the Russian navy's general staff Viktor Kravchenko.\n\nYue said there were few large-tonnage Russian ships left and two sister ships could not enter the Black Sea as Turkey had closed off the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to warships from any country. \"So it will be a major loss for Russian naval forces -- it is silenced when it is most needed,\" he said.\n\nLi Jie, a navy analyst based in Beijing, said it was a \"major loss\" for the Russian navy which had reduced its ability to deter US forces.\n\n\"It had been in service for many years and was equipped with anti-ship missiles with a strong attack capability. Its main target was US carriers, so the attack capability was strong but the defence capability was weak,\" Li said.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://i.insider.com/625ce8733958c2001823d4e0?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7641614", "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 7, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 20, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7008003852", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-18", "time": "12:49:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-18T12:49:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-18T11:59:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4588235318660736, "url": "https://censor.net/en/news/3334954/destroyed_cruiser_moscow_is_10_of_russian_fleet_in_black_sea_us_general_ryan", "title": "Destroyed cruiser \"Moscow\" is 10% of Russian fleet in Black Sea, - US General Ryan", "body": "Retired Brigadier General Kevin Ryan, a senior fellow at the Belfer Center at Harvard Kennedy School, said Moscow's strategic loss to Russia was great.\n\nHe told about it in an interview with TSN, reported by Censor.NET.\n\nAccording to him, of course, the flooding of \"Moscow\" was important symbolically, because it was probably the largest Russian ship in the Black Sea Fleet.\n\n\"It was a flagship. But the most important thing about symbolism is that it had a real impact on the Russian fleet in the Black Sea and the ability of Russia to achieve its strategic goals in the Black Sea region,\" said Kevin Ryan.\n\nThe loss of \"Moscow\", according to experts, probably amounted to about 10% of Russia's naval combat power in the Black Sea.\n\nSo 10% was lost. It was a coordination ship and a communications center that they used to cover or could cover, for example, a landing in Odessa. This is no longer possible. And Russia clearly wants more control over the Black Sea region. And so they are trying to seize so much land in southern Ukraine to cut off Ukraine from the Black Sea.
