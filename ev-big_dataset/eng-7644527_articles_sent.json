There also seems to be a firefighting ship behind the vessel, on the opposite side to the camera, which is spraying jets of water into the air.\n\nMultiple black marks scar the port-side of the ship, including several near deck level where smoke appears to have streamed out of portholes and left black marks on the paint. But there are also dark marks close to the waterline that don't match the position of portholes and suggest the ship has sustained external damage.\n\nThat means the images are largely consistent with Ukrainian descriptions of the sinking - that the Moskva was hit by two missiles on its port side which sparked a fire and caused it to roll - and contradict Russia's account which was that the ship suffered a fire and internal explosion in rough seas.\n\nAnalysts and experts who reviewed the images say they do appear genuine. It is unlikely that Russia will confirm the authenticity of the pictures, amid a near-total information blackout around the sinking which is a huge embarrassment to Vladimir Putin's beleaguered armed forces.\n\nMoscow did stage what appeared to be a parade of crew members in the port of Sevastopol - in occupied Crimea - on Saturday, during which the captain of the warship and between 150 and 250 members of its crew were shown on camera alongside Black Sea Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov. The Moskva typically carries up to 510 sailors, and there was no word on the whereabouts of the remaining crew or their condition.\n\nBut horror accounts of the sinking have started to emerge from conscripts serving on board the ship, with one telling his parents that at least 40 members of the crew were killed with 'many' left missing or maimed with lost limbs after the strike.\n\nImages have emerged which appear to show the Russian warship Moskva heavily damaged and on fire in the Black Sea shortly before it sank.

Clearly not everyone survived.'\n\nShe said: 'Most of the wounded have limbs torn off, because of the explosions from both the missiles and the detonated ammunition.\n\n'My son was crying when he called me on 15 April.\n\n'He said: 'Mamochka (tender for mum), I never thought I'd get into such a mess during supposedly peaceful times. I won't even tell you the details of what I've seen, it was so horrendous'.'\n\nThe mother said: 'I don't want to share his name because I am scared to damage my son.\n\n'They signed non-disclosure agreements before boarding the cruiser.\n\n'Please understand me, I am terrified. I am petrified, and I don't know how I will wait for my son to return.'\n\nShe indicated that the Defence Ministry is stopping the survivors from going home, perhaps to prevent accounts of the calamity for Putin reaching the outside world.\n\n'I've no idea how I'll live through this while waiting for my son to return, waiting for him to finish his service. It's awful.\n\n'And the [state] media, of course, doesn't give any details.\n\n'Why? Because the Ministry of Defence doesn't want to admit defeat by Ukraine.

Let me punch you in the face.'\n\n'He didn't even come out, behind bars he showed his hands criss-cross, to say goodbye, that's all.\n\n'This is the service of the navy and the FSB of Sevastopol.'\n\nThey tried to get the authorities to show them the list of the dead and missing, but were refused.\n\nA commander who was on the ship also contacted Irina.\n\nShe recalled: 'I said: 'Can you at least tell me how my son died?'\n\n'And he said: 'I don't know anything, they were at the supply post.

Russia has insisted the reason for the sinking was a fire, but the US on Friday confirmed Ukraine's account, with a senior defense official saying that the US believes that two Ukrainian Neptune missiles hit the Russian warship.\n\nCarl Schuster, a retired US Navy captain and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center told CNN on Monday it was likely the missiles penetrated below the ship's bridge and detonated.\n\n\"Assuming the photo is not faked in some way or photo-shopped, it looks like the missile(s) hit forward, which is not unexpected,\" he said. \"Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles (ASCMs) tend to go for the center of the radar return, which typically is the forward section of the superstructure.\"\n\nIndependent defense analyst and author, H I Sutton, told CNN the damage shown on the photos \"does not rule out a missile strike(s), and it remains the likely cause.\"\n\n\"Possible puncture marks in the side of the hull are visible below where the fire is. But these would need closer examination to confirm whether they were caused by missiles or are simply fire damage,\" he said.\n\nThe Moskva was armed with a range of anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles as well as torpedoes, naval guns and missile defense systems, meaning it would have had large amounts of explosives aboard.\n\nThe Russian military has not released any information about casualties aboard the Moskva.\n\nRussia's Ministry of Defense released a video Saturday showing what was described as officers and sailors of the sunken warship standing in formation two rows deep. The number of sailors in formation was not clear. It was unclear how many crew members were aboard, or how many survived.\n\nSutton says the images show that all the life rafts have been deployed, \"All of the aft life raft canisters have been jettisoned, although one remains on the aft deck. This suggests that the crew have already abandoned ship at this point,\" he said.\n\nA large Russian rescue tug can be seen dousing the warship with water on the far side.\n\n'We all realize that we will not be forgiven.' Ukraine braces for new assault after sinking of Russian flagship\n\nThe Kremlin on Monday said it had seen the photos of the Moskva, but that they could not verify them. \"Yes, we really saw the footage, but we cannot say how authentic and true it is,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nA senior US defense official who said that they had also seen the photos and video of the ship burning told CNN Monday the US \"can't independently verify those images.\"\n\n\"But the images themselves comport with what we had assessed to be the damage done to the ship,\" the official said.\n\nThe photographers of the images and video are unknown, but they were taken from a vessel close to the stricken warship. In the short video taken from the same vantage point a voice from an unseen person can be heard shouting in Russian: \"F**k (inaudible) what you did!\"\n\nThe Moskva was one of Russia's most visible assets in the Ukraine war and its loss could impact the morale of Russian troops.\n\nTellingly, the Russian government has not acknowledged casualties in the sinking of the ship, a marked contrast to the very public discussion about the Kursk submarine disaster, which claimed the lives of 118 sailors in 2000.\n\nAnalysts say the loss of the warship would have struck hard at the heart of the Russian navy as well as national pride, comparable to the US Navy losing a battleship during World War II or an aircraft carrier today.\n\n\"Only the loss of a ballistic missile submarine or the Kutznetsov (Russia's lone aircraft carrier) would inflict a more serious blow to Russian morale and the navy's reputation with the Russian public,\" Schuster said.", "source": {"uri": "egyptindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Egypt Independent"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://amayei.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2022/04/https-_cdn.cnn_.com_cnnnext_dam_assets_220418131404-moska-fire-0418.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7644527", "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 18, "stanza_neu": 16, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 34, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7007833004", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-18", "time": "10:10:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-18T10:10:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-18T10:08:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/moskva-sank-first-pictures-russia-ukraine-war-b994842.html", "title": "Dramatic first picture 'shows Moskva moments before it sank'", "body": "It seems to match the Moskva and appear to show multiple lifeboats in the Black Sea around the damaged vessel which was surrounded by black smoke.\n\nRussians admitted its flagship warship had sunk after an ammunition explosion.

Significant fire damage is visible above decks, and the ship has a pronounced list to port.\n\n\"Black smoke marks at multiple hull penetrations near the main deck level are consistent with an internal fire running aft of the site of impact, according to analysts.\"\n\nThe images show a calm sea, contrary to official Russian reports claiming there was a storm or rough seas.\n\nThe ship's normal crew complement was 510 but at a parade involving \"survivors\" held afterwards in Sevastopol, only around 150 were present according to footage supplied to the Russian media by the Defence Ministry.\n\nNo explanation was given for the missing sailors, nor about possible wounded seamen.\n\nA source told Russian media VHCK-OGPU - which has links to ruling circles in Moscow - that the cruiser sank shortly after these pictures were taken.\n\nIf true, this means the Russian government statements that it sank under tow back to port Sevastopol area false.\n\n\"According to the source, shortly after this photograph was taken, the cruiser Moskva sank,\" said the outlet.\n\n\"The source said that the photo of the sinking cruiser Moskva was taken from a Turkish ship. Earlier, VHCK-OGPU reported that Turkish sailors rescued 54 crew members of the cruiser. These photos show that all life rafts are missing from the sinking cruiser Moscow.\n\n\"It was on them that the crew was saved. According to Turkey (this was reported by the VCHK-OGPU), at 1.05 an SOS signal was received from the cruiser, on which the nearest ships moved to the crash site, including the Turkish ship that saved

happened.\n\nBut photos released on social media give clues about the incident and appear to poke holes in the Russian explanation that the Soviet-era flagship of its Black Sea fleet sank in stormy seas after an onboard fire.\n\nUkraine's version is that it hit the ship in a brazen missile strike which would be one of the highest-profile naval attacks in decades.\n\nRussia disputes this, saying the vessel was damaged after an onboard fire caused ammunition to explode.\n\nThe Moskva subsequently sank, it says, as it was being towed in a storm.\n\nBut images and video posted on Twitter appeared to show a badly damaged Moskva, with black holes in its side, in calm seas and benign weather.\n\nConversely, they fail to provide conclusive proof that the Moskva was struck by two Neptune missiles, as Ukraine insisted on April 14.\n\nHowever, military experts say the damage shown by social media images is \"consistent\" with a missile attack.\n\nRetired British rear admiral Chris Parry, a former NATO commander, told the BBC he was sure the damage was caused by a missile strike, rather than an internal explosion, saying he believed the ship was hit \"by one or two missiles\".\n\nA three-second video, taken from a nearby ship and posted on Twitter, appears to show the Moskva shortly after the attack.\n\nIn the video, a tug boat is on the right of the Moskva.\n\nThe freeboard section of the ship is badly damaged as smoke billows into the air.\n\nThe Moskva looks unstable and is leaning heavily to the left, having taken on water.\n\nAuthor and ship captain John Konrad tweeted another view of the Moskva, using arrows to show the tug's position.\n\n\"[It's] close alongside starboard aft,\" he tweeted.\n\n\"It is also possible the tug is made fast and is pulling the ship astern.\"\n\nWhile the loss of the 510-crew warship is seen as a boost for Ukrainian morale, experts do not expect its loss to have a major impact on Russia's invasion campaign.\n\nAnother Twitter post appears to show before and after images of the Moskva, which first entered service with the Soviet navy in 1983 and had seen leaders from Mikhail Gorbachev to Vladimir Putin host world dignitaries onboard.\n\nRussia has not admitted that it suffered any casualties in the loss of the ship.\n\nOn Saturday -- three days after the initial incident -- the Russian defence ministry released video of what it described as the entire crew of the Moskva marching in a parade at Sevastopol, a Crimean port city.\n\nAfter the demise of the Moskva, the Russian navy will look to the Marshal Ustinov and the Varyag -- the only other two ships that have multiple anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles.\n\nBefore being renamed Moskva (Russian for Moscow) in 1995 after the fall of the Soviet Union, the vessel was called \"Slava\" (\"Glory\").\n\nBut the social media images seem to suggest a rather inglorious end to the 39-year-old ship, even if we may never

Huge plumes of black smoke can be seen towering above the listing vessel following Wednesday morning's attack.

I asked them directly, \"Why are you officers alive and my son, a conscript, has died?\" I ask everyone who is not afraid, not indifferent, to spread this appeal of mine.\n\n'A man whose son was taken away in such a vile way is not afraid of anything.'\n\nThe mother of another sailor said many crew were listed as missing, rather than dead, to spare the Kremlin embarrassment over losing so many personnel. She said: 'There are dead, there are wounded, there are missing. My son was crying when he called me to say what he saw. It was terrifying. Clearly not everyone made it alive. A lot have lost limbs.'\n\nA Russian TV presenter also raised questions about the Moskva. During his prime time show Vladimir Solovyov said: 'Explain to me how you managed to lose it. Why did your fire extinguishers not work? The ship burned from the inside out.'\n\nLast night, former Royal Navy officer Rear Admiral Chris Parry said the Moskva had not been 'properly prepared for action' and suggested the internal fire could have been contained.\n\nThe absence of the ship's life rafts and the positioning of its crane in the footage indicate rescue boats were launched. The missiles hit the Moskva amidships, destroying her propulsion and electrical power systems. These compartments would have given off the largest radar 'signature'.\n\nAs the warship was constructed in Ukraine, its attackers may have been able to study its schematics.

Even if it was hit with two missiles, and it ignited the ammunition...\n\n'What happened to your fire fighting system?'\n\nHis rant contrasted with recent Sunday evening where he has lauded the Russian war machine and heaped blame on the West, for example accusing Britain of choreographing the massacre in Bucha, claiming the horrors were staged and had nothing to do with Putin's forces.\n\nHis blast echoes other whispers that Putin was left incandescent by the loss of the Moskva.\n\nThe Kremlin went into denial over the sinking and it is still unclear how many perished, with estimates that it runs into the hundreds.\n\nFootage of some of the 'rescued crew' lining up on a Sevastopol parade ground - broadcast on Saturday - failed to clarify the matter.\n\nIt showed perhaps 150 sailors, including an officer who closely resembled 1st rank Captain Anton Kuprin, commander of the Moskva, who the Ukrainians claimed had been killed in the sinking.\n\nYet the date the Defence Ministry footage was filmed was unclear.\n\nSo too was the fate of sailors not present from a crew which is believed to number 510.\n\nSolovyov appeared to have been given license to hit out at the navy - indicating that the Kremlin is seeking to find a culprit for the catastrophic loss of the cruiser.\n\nThere are suggestions that Vice Admiral Igor Osipov, commander of the Black Sea Fleet, has been detained or suspended over the loss of the flagship.\n\nAdvertisement", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/18/21/56759541-0-image-a-2_1650314348874.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7644527", "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 38, "stanza_neu": 44, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 83, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7008211255", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-18", "time": "16:10:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-18T16:10:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-18T16:09:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "url": "https://www.smobserved.com/story/2022/04/19/news/russia-broadcasts-first-images-of-survivors-from-sunken-cruiser-moska-only-about-50-men-visible-on-russian-tv/6685.html", "title": "Russia Broadcasts First Images of Survivors from Sunken Cruiser Moska.

The event was attended by about 200 people.\"\n\nOn April 14, the Moskva cruiser was seriously damaged by the detonation of ammunition , provoked by a fire on board.

If the ship was sunk by two Ukrainian-made Neptune missiles, as Ukrainian and unidentified U.S. Defense Department officials have claimed, then why did it lack an antimissile system?\n\n\"Just explain to me how you managed to lose it,\" Mr. Solovyev said on his Saturday show, not directing the question at anyone in particular.\n\nThe segment was unusual not least because Mr. Solovyev broached the idea that Ukraine had managed to sink the Moskva, one of the biggest naval losses anywhere in the world since World War II.\n\nOverall, Russian media has stuck to the official version promulgated by the Ministry of Defense and echoed on TASS, a state news agency. That version held that a fire onboard had ignited an ammunition magazine, seriously damaging the Moskva, named for the Russian capital.\n\nAfter the crew of at least 510 men was evacuated, according to Russia's defense ministry, the ship sank in rough seas while being towed back to Sevastopol, the Crimean headquarters of the fleet.

The Defense Ministry said that the warship's hull had been damaged by an ammunition explosion that was caused by a fire on board on Wednesday.\n\nThe Moskva was reportedly around 90km south of the Ukrainian port city of Odessa on Wednesday when a fire broke out on board. The Russian military said that the crew was then evacuated by nearby Black Sea Fleet ships and transported to Sevastopol.\n\nThe crew count on the ship when the fire broke out has not been revealed. In 2009, when the cruiser was visited in Novorossiysk by then-President Dmitry Medvedev, there were 416 crew members on board, including 38 officers.\n\nBefore the Russian military provided its account of a fire onboard the Moskva, Kiev claimed that the vessel had been struck by Ukrainian anti-ship missiles. The head of the Odessa region's military administration, Maxim Marchenko, stated on Wednesday evening that \"very serious damage\" to the Moskva was caused by Ukrainian Neptune missiles fired from Odessa.\n\nThe warship was launched in 1979 and entered service in 1982 under the name Slava.

There also seems to be a firefighting ship behind the vessel, on the opposite side to the camera, which is spraying jets of water into the air.\n\nMultiple black marks scar the port-side of the ship, including several near deck level where smoke appears to have streamed out of portholes and left black marks on the paint. But there are also dark marks close to the waterline that don't match the position of portholes and suggest the ship has sustained external damage.\n\nThat means the images are largely consistent with Ukrainian descriptions of the sinking - that the Moskva was hit by two missiles on its port side which sparked a fire and caused it to roll - and contradict Russia's account which was that the ship suffered a fire and internal explosion in rough seas.\n\nAnalysts and experts who reviewed the images say they do appear genuine. It is unlikely that Russia will confirm the authenticity of the pictures, amid a near-total information blackout around the sinking which is a huge embarrassment to Vladimir Putin's beleaguered armed forces.\n\nMoscow did stage what appeared to be a parade of crew members in the port of Sevastopol - in occupied Crimea - on Saturday, during which the captain of the warship and between 150 and 250 members of its crew were shown on camera alongside Black Sea Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov. The Moskva typically carries up to 510 sailors, and there was no word on the whereabouts of the remaining crew or their condition.\n\nBut horror accounts of the sinking have started to emerge from conscripts serving on board the ship, with one telling his parents that at least 40 members of the crew were killed with 'many' left missing or maimed with lost limbs after the strike.\n\nImages have emerged which appear to show the Russian warship Moskva heavily damaged and on fire in the Black Sea shortly before it sank. The picture shows heavy damage to the left side of the vessel, which is largely consistent with Ukrainian accounts that they shot it with two missiles before it rolled and went under\n\nThe pictures seem to contradict Russian accounts of the sinking, after Moscow claimed the warship sank in choppy seas while being towed to the port of Sevastopol following an explosion on board\n\nMoskva (pictured last leaving port on April 10) got into trouble on April 14 while sailing around 60 miles off the coast of Odesa - Ukraine's largest port - before Moscow confirmed she had sunk on April 15\n\nParents of another conscript say they have found out some 200 were wounded - many with horrific burns and other major injuries.\n\n'I first heard from him only on 15 April, two days after the incident,' a distraught mother told Novaya Gazeta, Russia's leading investigative media outlet which is now operating outside Russia after being gagged by Putin.\n\n'My son said the cruiser was hit from the land, from the Ukrainian side, because the fire on board would not have started without a reason.

They signed non-disclosure agreements before boarding the cruiser. Please understand me, I am terrified. I am petrified, and I don't know how I will wait for my son to return.'\n\nShe indicated that the Defence Ministry is stopping the survivors from going home, perhaps to prevent accounts of the calamity for Putin reaching the outside world.\n\n'I've no idea how I'll live through this while waiting for my son to return, waiting for him to finish his service. It's awful. And the [state] media, of course, doesn't give any details. Why? Because the Ministry of Defence doesn't want to admit defeat by Ukraine.

A commander who was on the ship also contacted Irina.\n\nShe recalled: 'I said: \"Can you at least tell me how my son died?\" And he said: \"I don't know anything, they were at the supply post.

DER SPIEGEL journalist Oliver Das Gupta posted a picture of a burning Moskva on Monday. Check the photo here:\n\nMax Sheddon, the Moscow bureau chief of Financial Times, on the other hand shared a brief video of the same:\n\nThe three-second video clip shows the Moskva in the distance listing heavily on her port side. Smoke can be seen billowing out of the ship, with a section of the freeboard heavily damaged. Holes are also visible in other parts of the freeboard in one picture, suggesting the warship had taken in a substantial amount of water. It also appears all of the vessel's lifeboats had been deployed.\n\nWhy is this of interest\n\nOn 13 April Ukrainian officials said their forces hit the Moskva missile cruiser with missiles, while Russia acknowledged a fire aboard it but not an attack.\n\nMaksym Marchenko, the governor of the Odesa region, said Ukraine struck the ship late Wednesday with two Neptune missiles and caused \"serious damage.\" Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's defense minister, later said he was unable to confirm its fate or if it even had been hit by Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe Moskva was about 100 to 104 kilometers due south of Odesa when the fire occurred, according to a senior US defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal US military assessments.\n\nBut in his nightly video address to the nation, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alluded to the sinking as he told Ukrainians they should be proud of having survived 50 days under attack when the Russians \"gave us a maximum of five.\"\n\nListing the many ways Ukraine has defended against the invasion, he noted \"those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it's to the bottom\" of the sea. It was his only reference to the missile cruiser.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry on the other hand said the heavily damaged Moskva sank in a storm under tow after being gutted by fire. It previously said the blaze set off some of its weapons and forced the crew to evacuate. It denied there had been an attack by Ukraine on the ship, which would normally have about 500 sailors aboard.\n\nThe sinking of Moskva\n\nThe loss of the warship named for the Russian capital is a devastating symbolic defeat for Moscow.\n\nThe Moskva had the capacity to carry 16 long-range cruise missiles, and its removal reduces Russia's firepower in the Black Sea. It's also a blow to Moscow's prestige in a war already widely seen as a historic blunder.\n\nDuring the first days of the war, the Moskva was reportedly the ship that called on Ukrainian soldiers stationed on Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender in a standoff.\n\nHistory\n\nThe warship was launched as the Slava from a shipyard in Mykolaiv in what was then the Soviet republic of Ukraine in July 1979, according to open-source intelligence firm Janes. Commissioned in late December 1982, it was 611.5 feet (186 meters) long. It was designed to carry a crew of 476 with an additional 62 officers.\n\nThe Slava served as the flagship of the Soviet fleet in the Black Sea. It carried both surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, deck guns, torpedoes and mortars. It also had a helicopter deck.\n\nDuring the Cold War, it also carried nuclear weapons. In 1989, under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, US and Soviet scientists took part in a joint test abroad the Slava in the Black Sea to measure the emission of neutrons and gamma rays from a nuclear warhead on a cruise missile.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press the Slava underwent repairs from 1990-1999. During that time, the Soviet Union collapsed, an independent Ukraine emerged and Russia's economy foundered. Finally overhauled and rechristened the Moskva, the ship hosted both President Vladimir Putin and then-Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi during a 2003 visit to Sardinia.\n\n\"Thank God, our cruisers can still go on their own, our planes and missiles can fly,\" Putin said at the time.\n\nPutin's later comments at the La Maddalena naval base show how much has changed. He described the Moskva's presence as a sign that \"the level of trust between Russia and the NATO countries is rising.\" NATO's eastward expansion and Russian security were among the reasons Putin cited for sending troops to Ukraine.\n\nDuring Russia's war in its former republic of Georgia in 2008, the Moskva took part in operations in the Black Sea, and Georgia said it was involved in an attack on the country.\n\nIn 2014, as Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula, the Moskva blocked Ukrainian naval vessels from leaving Lake Donuzlav.\n\nIn 2015-16, it was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea to provide support for the Russian military campaign backing Syrian President Bashar Assad in his country's civil war. Its sailors were decorated for their service there and in the war on Georgia.\n\nThe Moskva underwent repairs and modernization from 2018 to July 2020, according to Janes.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/moskva-1.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7644527", "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 35, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 46, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 2, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7008767368", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-19", "time": "04:55:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-19T04:55:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-19T04:54:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "url": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/europe/300569049/moskva-captain-may-have-abandoned-ship-early-new-images-suggest", "title": "Moskva captain may have abandoned ship early, new images suggest", "body": "The captain of Moskva, Russia's sunk Black Sea Fleet flagship, may have abandoned it too early, experts have suggested, after new images of the stricken vessel emerged on Monday.\n\nHundreds of crew members are believed to remain unaccounted for after the ship was reportedly hit by Ukrainian missiles before sinking in the Black Sea last Thursday.\n\nRussia has insisted that the damage to the ship was caused by an explosion of ammunition in an unexplained fire, which led it to sink while being towed in choppy seas.\n\nNew images and footage circulating online, which have not been officially verified, appear to show the Moskva on fire and apparently abandoned.

Water hoses can also be seen spraying in the air, potentially from a nearby salvage vessel.\n\nThe continued buoyancy of the ship coupled with the absence of its 510 crew members on the upper decks potentially suggest that the captain may have left the ship too early.\n\nTom Sharpe, a retired commander in the Royal Navy who once helped save the UK's ice patrol vessel during a flood, told the Telegraph that the ship appeared to have been abandoned too soon.\n\nHe said: \"You will always see a team, normally on the flight deck. In this case, the flight deck would be a good place to gather your equipment and firefighting teams. You want to set up safe zones and that's where you put all your firefighting equipment and all your people, so they're in fresh air.\"\n\n\"But there's nobody there and if there is no one, there is almost no chance of anyone being alive below deck. It also suggests that everyone is off that ship,\" Sharpe added.\n\nJohn Konrad, an author who has captained civilian ships, wrote an analysis of the images which concluded that his \"best guess\" was that \"the captain of the Moskva abandoned his ship too early\".\n\nHe pointed out that the flagship was crucial to the Russian war effort and that normally, the captain would be expected to stay on board to try to save the ship.\n\nIn this case, the ship appeared to have been abandoned despite the \"calm weather, reserve buoyancy\" and \"the fact the helideck was smoke-free\", Konrad wrote.\n\nSharpe, however, said that there was too much uncertainty around the images to make this assertion with any certainty.\n\n\"You could just be unlucky\", he said.\n\n\"You could take a massive detonation on another munition by the incoming missile and that rips out all your command and control, all your communications, all your systems and then you're done. At that point, you might as well get off, because there is nothing any of you can do,\" Sharpe said.\n\nHe added, however, that the new images appeared to undermine Russia's own account of how the Moskva met its fate.\n\n\"There are holes in the side of the ship that clearly look like missile entry points,\" Sharpe suggested.\n\nReferring to the Russian response, he said: \"Then they were talking about a storm and if you're trying to do a tow with a badly damaged ship, it will make things a lot worse, but it's not stormy. It's flat and calm. I think this goes some way to disproving that allegation.\"\n\nFootage released by Russia's defence ministry over the Easter weekend showed the ship's crew back at their home base. However, the crew appeared to be at least one half of the 510 members believed to have been onboard.\n\nIt is also unclear when the footage was taken, raising the possibility that it may have been captured before the Moskva was attacked.\n\nThe damage to the Russian flagship appears to have mostly been done to the amidships part of the cruiser, far away from some of the boat's main ordinances.\n\nThe smoke billowing from portholes and the open helicopter hangar suggest significant internal fire damage, perhaps indicating possible loss of life.\n\nIt is not clear whether the helicopter had a chance to be deployed before the crew were either killed or evacuated.", "source": {"uri": "stuff.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stuff"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/4/y/y/8/j/z/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.4yy8k9.png/1650342989433.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7644527", "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 19, "stanza_neu": 17, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 36, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7008500085", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-18", "time": "21:53:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-18T21:53:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-18T20:54:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "url": "https://kion546.com/news/2022/04/18/new-photos-show-russian-warship-moskva-before-it-sank/", "title": "New photos show Russian warship Moskva before it sank - KION546", "body": "By Jonny Hallam, Brad Lendon, Uliana Pavlova and Ivana Kottasov\u00e1, CNN\n\nNew photos and a short video clip emerged early Monday on social media showing Russia's guided-missile cruiser, the Moskva, badly damaged and on fire in the hours before the ship sunk in the Black Sea on Thursday.\n\nThe sinking of the Black Sea fleet flagship was the biggest wartime loss of a naval ship in 40 years -- and a huge embarrassment for Russia.\n\nThe images show the Moskva listing to one side, with black holes from possible missile puncture marks, and significant scarring at and just above the waterline on the port (left) side in the middle of the vessel.\n\nA large plume of black smoke can be seen billowing upwards, partly obscuring the front of the stricken ship.\n\nAnalysts who spoke to CNN confirmed that the warship in the images looked like the Moskva, a Slava Class guided-missile destroyer and the flagship of Russian's Black Sea fleet.\n\nUkraine and Russia have provided conflicting accounts of what happened during Thursday's incident in the Black Sea.\n\nMoscow has denied the Ukrainian version of events -- that the Moskva sunk after being struck by Ukrainian missiles -- but it admitted the ship went down. Russia has insisted the reason for the sinking was a fire, but the US on Friday confirmed Ukraine's account, with a senior defense official saying that the US believes that two Ukrainian Neptune missiles hit the Russian warship.\n\nCarl Schuster, a retired US Navy captain and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center told CNN on Monday that his is assessment was that the missiles penetrated below the ship's bridge and detonated.\n\n\"Assuming the photo is not faked in some way or photo-shopped, it looks like the missile(s) hit forward, which is not unexpected,\" he said. \"Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles (ASCMs) tend to go for the center of the radar return, which typically is the forward section of the superstructure.\"\n\nH I Sutton, an independent defense analyst and author, told CNN the damage shown on the photos \"does not rule out a missile strike(s), and it remains the likely cause.\"\n\n\"Possible puncture marks in the side of the hull are visible below where the fire is. But these would need closer examination to confirm whether they were caused by missiles or are simply fire damage,\" he said.\n\nThe Moskva was armed with a range of anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles as well as torpedoes, naval guns and missile defense systems, meaning it would have had large amounts of explosives aboard.\n\nThe Russian military has not released any information about casualties aboard the Moskva.\n\nRussia's Ministry of Defense released a video Saturday showing what was described as officers and sailors of the sunken warship standing in formation two rows deep. The number of sailors in formation was not clear. It was unclear how many crew members were aboard, or how many survived.\n\nSutton says the images show that all the life rafts have been deployed, \"All of the aft life raft canisters have been jettisoned, although one remains on the aft deck. This suggests that the crew have already abandoned ship at this point,\" he said.\n\nA large Russian rescue tug can be seen dousing the warship with water on the far side.\n\nThe Kremlin on Monday said it had seen the photos of the Moskva, but that they could not verify them. \"Yes, we really saw the footage, but we cannot say how authentic and true it is,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nA senior US defense official who said that they had also seen the photos and video of the ship burning told CNN Monday the US \"can't independently verify those images.\"\n\n\"But the images themselves comport with what we had assessed to be the damage done to the ship,\" the official said.\n\nThe photographers of the images and video are unknown, but they were taken from a vessel close to the stricken warship. In the short video taken from the same vantage point a voice from an unseen person can be heard shouting in Russian: \"F**k (inaudible) what you did!\"\n\nThe Moskva was one of Russia's most visible assets in the Ukraine war and its loss could impact the morale of Russian troops.\n\nTellingly, the Russian government has not acknowledged casualties in the sinking of the ship, a marked contrast to the very public discussion about the Kursk submarine disaster, which claimed the lives of 118 sailors in 2000.\n\nAnalysts say the loss of the warship would have struck hard at the heart of the Russian navy as well as national pride, comparable to the US Navy losing a battleship during World War II or an aircraft carrier today.\n\n\"Only the loss of a ballistic missile submarine or the Kutznetsov (Russia's lone aircraft carrier) would inflict a more serious blow to Russian morale and the navy's reputation with the Russian public,\" Schuster said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The images are likely to have been taken from the top of a rescue ship alongside the stricken Russian warship on Monday.\n\nThe videos and photos show the extent of damaged suffered by Moskva that became a potent target of Ukrainian defiance in the opening days of the war. Moskva drew notoriety after it opened fire on a Ukrainian troop defending the Snake Island after they refused to surrender during the initial days of the war.\n\nUp in Flames\n\nThe images, which appear to have been shot from a rescue vessel beside the crippled Russian battleship, show damage to the left side of the vessel, as well as flames burning below deck and a heavy pall of black smoke billowing into the sky.\n\nVideo taken from a nearby ship shows the Moskva seen sitting low in the water, tilting to the port side, with its lifeboats deployed but no personnel visible on board. The helicopter's rear helicopter door is likewise open, indicating that it has taken off.\n\nA firefighting ship appears to be following the vessel and shooting water jets into the air.\n\nThe port side of the ship is scarred by numerous black scars, including some near deck level where smoke appears to have flowed out of portholes and left marks on the paint. However, there are black stains along the waterline that don't match the position of portholes, implying that the ship has been damaged from the outside.\n\nThe photographs match the description Ukrainian officials had earlier given of Moskva sinking in the Black Sea after being hit by two Ukrainian missiles last week. Ukraine had claimed that two missiles had hit the ship, with one on its port side which sparked a fire and caused it to roll.\n\nSinking Pride\n\nThe sinking of Moskva definitely is a big blow to the Russians given that it has already suffered huge losses so far. Despite Ukraine's claims of Moskva being hit by missiles, Russia has been giving a different account.\n\nAccording to Moscow, the ship suffered a fire and internal explosion in rough seas that caused it to sink. However, the vide and the images tell a different story.\n\nSince then, video has surfaced that appears to show two rescue vessels approaching the flaming ship, one on the left side and the other on the right, with a Russian speaker shouting. Before the short clip finishes, one man asks, \"What the f*** are you doing?\"\n\nThe photographs, according to analysts and specialists, look authentic. In the midst of a near-total information blackout surrounding the disaster, which is a great humiliation to Vladimir Putin's embattled armed forces, it's unlikely that Russia will acknowledge the veracity of the photos.\n\nOn Sunday, Russia shared photos of the crew members seen parading in the Port of Sevastopol, who they claim to have survived the attack. The warship's captain and between 150 and 250 members of his crew were photographed beside Black Sea Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov at the ceremony.\n\nThe Moskva can carry up to 510 sailors, and there was no indication on the whereabouts or status of the remaining personnel.\n\nHowever, conscripts working on board the ship have begun to give terrifying descriptions of the sinking, with one telling his parents that at least 40 members of the crew were dead, with \"many\" missing or disfigured as a result of the strike. Hundreds of people are said to have killed when the ship sank.\n\nParents of another conscript say they have found out some 200 were wounded, many with horrific burns and other major injuries. \"I first heard from him only on 15 April, two days after the incident,\" a distraught mother told Novaya Gazeta, Russia's leading investigative media outlet which is now operating outside Russia after being gagged by Putin.\n\n\"My son said the cruiser was hit from the land, from the Ukrainian side, because the fire on board would not have started without a reason. There are people who were killed, wounded and missing. My son called me as soon as they were given phones [after being rescued]. Their documents and phones were on the cruiser. He called me, and he cried over what he had seen. It was horrendous. Clearly not everyone survived,\" she said\n\nThe stories are possibly true given the footage that has emerged now.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky told Ukrainians after the ship was sunk that they should be proud of themselves for surviving 50 days under siege when the Russians \"only gave us five.\"", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, Singapore Edition"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_ghosh@ibtimes.sg", "name": "R.

The ship eventually sank because of the damage. There are still numerous conflicting reports about exactly what happened: whether Ukraine distracted the Moskva with drones before attacking it with missiles, questions about how many of the crew died and the circumstances of the final sinking, etc. What is crystal clear is that the Moskva is at the bottom of the Black Sea, that the Ukrainians put it there, and therefore that Russia has suffered an embarrassing naval defeat against a country that, in effect, no longer has a fleet. The reaction of some Russian propagandists to the sinking also provides an interesting example of how they are increasingly blaming Russia's military failures on NATO, rather than on Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe significance of the sinking of the Moskva to the current fighting is mostly on the symbolism/morale front. The main armament of the Moskva were anti-ship missiles, which are not relevant while the Ukrainian navy is out of action. (The Ukrainian navy has lost at least one ship out on patrol, and the Ukrainian naval base at Odesa has probably been struck multiple times and destroyed their capabilities further. The Ukrainian ships that remain lack the weaponry to take on the Russian fleet.) The loss of the anti-aircraft/anti-missile capabilities of the Moskva might be a technical blow to the Russian Black Sea fleet (it carried an S-300 AA system), but its significance is unclear. (Any air defense systems it had were obviously not sufficient to defend the ship itself, or perhaps they were switched off.) According to retired Ukrainian naval Capt. Andrii Ryzhenko, the Russian Black Sea fleet has three main tasks: 1) blockade Ukrainian ports, 2) neutralize the Ukrainian navy, and 3) conduct a landing operation if needed. The Moskva is not needed to blockade Ukrainian ports, the Ukrainian fleet is unfortunately already ineffective as its remaining ships have inadequate armament to pose a serious threat to Russian ships, and a naval landing near Odesa would make sense only as part of the three-pronged attack from the Russian base in Transnistria (a Russian proxy enclave in Moldova), Mykolaiv, and the sea, something which does not appear to be in the cards as the Ukrainians have turned back the Russian assault on Mykolaiv.\n\nThe main thing the Russians lost was not any specific capability but their flagship, one that had already become internationally emblematic early in the war. On February 24, the first day of Putin's expanded war, it was the Moskva that demanded the surrender of the Ukrainians defending Zmiinyi Island (aka Snake island). A Ukrainian defender delivered the memorable reply \"Russian warship, go f--- yourself.\" The Moskva then opened fire with its twin 130mm deck guns and, with the help of at least one other Russian warship, forced the Ukrainian defenders to surrender. The incident became a famous symbol of Ukrainian resistance. Last week the Ukrainian postal service even issued a stamp depicting one of the Ukrainian defenders on Snake Island giving the Moskva the finger.\n\nA photoshopped \"updated\" stamp showing the Moskva sinking is now floating around social media. Russian media are trying to contain the embarrassment and minimize the sense of disaster. Over the weekend the main Russian news show devoted just 30 seconds to the sinking. The TV channel of the Russian Ministry of Defense broadcast a video of an inspection of the crew of the Moskva by the commander. This video was probably partly motivated by a Russian desire to contradict reports of massive crew casualties and the death of the Moskva's commander. Even so, the loss of a large ship with a crew of about 450 can't just be ignored or dismissed. One prominent Russian propagandist, Vladimir Solovyov, expressed outrage at this disaster on his live show over the weekend:\n\n\"I'm furious about what happened to the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet -- the Moskva ... and we can say say, yes, she was many years old, yes, she was undergoing repairs, yes. Sure, this series of ships does have vulnerable places... I understand everything, can you just explain to me how you could lose it?\"\n\nIt appears that the evolving Russian propaganda response to this catastrophe is not to deny that it happened, but to deny that it happened in the way it is described: The Ukrainians didn't sink the Moskva; NATO sank the Moskva using Ukrainian proxies. As one Russian commentator put it, the Russian yellow press started disseminating the story that \"the attack on the cruiser Moskva was a carefully planned joint action of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and Western countries. In addition to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, military specialists from Britain, Canada and Australia took part in it.\"\n\nThis shift of \"blame\" for Russia's failures from Ukraine to NATO and other Western allies (above all the United States) is becoming a standard explanation, not just for the destruction of the Moskva. If Russia is failing to destroy Ukraine, a country that Russian propagandists have called \"fake,\" after ridiculing its military and society and announcing its imminent doom for years, what does that tell you about the Russian military and state? However, if Russia is in fact fighting NATO in Ukraine, then of course one should expect reverses. NATO forces are the best in the world, and of course the Russian military is having trouble. Losing against Ukraine is unacceptable; losing against NATO is understandable. Top Russian propagandist Margarita Simonyan, the longtime editor in chief of RT, recently made this argument at length when discussing Russia's battlefield failures:\n\nWe need to understand, when we see difficult events taking place, the losses, we need to understand that we are not fighting against Ukraine. Not at all! Not with Ukraine. And we are not just not fighting against Ukraine or Ukrainians from a moral and ethical point of view, but from an entirely technical, military point of view we are fighting with NATO! We are fighting against an enormous armed opponent, the most powerful and in essence the only one of its kind. In fact, not only the only one of its kind but the world's only military organization with such power.\n\nWe are on our own fighting against all of them. Just think about that. Every time when somebody asks you why we have been there [Ukraine] for 45 days already, not 45 weeks or 45 months but 45 days... Not weeks even, not months, let alone years. 'Look at how long we have been fighting Ukraine on its own!' Well, first of all it's Ukraine, Ukraine and not Georgia like in 2008, one could say. But that is not even the point. It is not Ukraine, it is NATO!\n\nOne can also see this desire to place as much blame as possible on NATO countries for Russia's failures in the current fighting for Maripuol. This coastal city in southern Donetsk was probably supposed to fall rapidly at the start of the fighting, like other cities in Ukraine's southeast. Instead Ukrainian defenders have endured over a month of grueling siege warfare. Today they have been pushed back to one or two pockets around an industrial plant in the city's south. Some Russian media outlets have been spreading the idea (in the Russian language) that there are foreign fighters there, even that the French Foreign Legion is directly engaged in the fighting. Yes, that is the storied French Foreign Legion, not the \"foreign legion\" rapidly established by the Ukrainians to organize foreign volunteers. This story seems to have its origins in the supposed discovery in Mariupol of a green French beret with a French Foreign Legion pin. \"Aha\", went some Russian messaging, \"here is the reason that President Macron is so interested in peace in Ukraine, he is trying to prevent the capture of his French soldiers we have surrounded!\" This kind of mythologizing can even give Russia some political victories while they are embarrassing themselves on the battlefield. One Russian military blog reported: \"After the publication of information that French military personnel may be participating in the battles in Mariupol, the rating of French President Emmanuel Macron dropped by several points.\"\n\nThis kind of messaging has its limits. If there were significant NATO forces and spies in Ukraine, enough to frustrate Russia's plans, shouldn't Putin and his spies have known about this and planned accordingly? (Solovyev made this argument during his rant about the loss of the Moskva.) This kind of messaging could also be used to pre-justify any activities Russia might take against NATO countries -- sabotage in Europe, for example. As with any propaganda, there is always a danger that the leaders of a country spreading these stories either believe it or come to believe it as time goes on. The threat of an expanded war in Europe does not stem from giving Ukraine enough weapons to resist Russian attacks, but in crazy ideas from Russian disinformation actually affecting Russian behavior.", "source": {"uri": "thedispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thedispatch.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_fink@thedispatch.com", "name": "Andrew Fink", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6267c91d-26e0-47e0-b06c-51c8633dadab_1024x638.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7644527", "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 21, "stanza_neu": 48, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 70, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7010640700", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-20", "time": "11:38:28", "dateTime": "2022-04-20T11:38:28Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-20T11:38:28Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "url": "https://wonderfulengineering.com/dramatic-first-picture-shows-the-moskva-moments-before-it-sank/", "title": "Dramatic First Picture Shows The Moskva Moments Before It Sank", "body": "The first image of the Russian cruiser Moskva before it sank has emerged.\n\nIt appears to be the same as the Moskva, with several lifeboats in the Black Sea surrounding the crippled vessel, engulfed in black smoke.\n\nAfter an ammunition explosion, Russia admitted that its flagship vessel had sunk.

Video / NBC News\n\nThe captain of Moskva, Russia's sunk Black Sea Fleet flagship, may have abandoned it too early, experts have suggested, after new images of the stricken vessel emerged on Monday.\n\nHundreds of crew members are believed to remain unaccounted for after the ship was reportedly hit by Ukrainian missiles before sinking in the Black Sea last Thursday.\n\nRussia has insisted that the damage to the ship was caused by an explosion of ammunition in an unexplained fire, which led it to sink while being towed in choppy seas.\n\nNew images and footage circulating online, which have not been officially verified, appears to show the Moskva on fire and apparently abandoned. Analysts have said that the damage visible to the hull contradicts Russia's version of events.\n\nA thick column of black smoke can be seen rising from a charred and burning section of the Moskva, which is listing to port and has had its lifeboats deployed. Water hoses can also be seen spraying in the air, potentially from a nearby salvage vessel.\n\nThe continued buoyancy of the ship coupled with the absence of any of its 510 crew members on the upper decks potentially suggests that the captain may have left the ship too early.\n\nTom Sharpe, a retired commander in the Royal Navy who once helped save the UK's ice patrol vessel during a flood, told the Telegraph that the ship appeared to have been abandoned too soon.\n\nHe said: \"You will always see a team, normally on the flight deck. In this case, the flight deck would be a good place to gather your equipment and firefighting teams. You want to set up safe zones and that's where you put all your firefighting equipment and all your people, so they're in fresh air.\n\n\"But there's nobody there and if there is no one, there is almost no chance of anyone being alive below deck. It also suggests that everyone is off that ship.\"\n\nJohn Konrad, an author who has captained civilian ships, wrote an analysis of the images which concluded that his \"best guess\" was that \"the captain of the Moskva abandoned his ship too early\".\n\nHe pointed out that the flagship was crucial to the Russian war effort and that normally, the captain would be expected to stay on board to try to save the ship.\n\nIn this case, the ship appeared to have been abandoned despite the \"calm weather, reserve buoyancy\" and \"the fact the helideck was smoke-free\", Konrad wrote.\n\nSharpe, however, said that there was too much uncertainty around the images to make this assertion with any certainty.\n\n\"You could just be unlucky.\n\n\"You could take a massive detonation on another munition by the incoming missile and that rips out all your command and control, all your communications, all your systems and then you're done. At that point, you might as well get off, because there is nothing any of you can do.\"\n\nHe added, however, that the new images appeared to undermine Russia's own account of how the Moskva met its fate.\n\n\"There are holes in the side of the ship that clearly look like missile entry points,\" Sharpe suggested.\n\nReferring to the Russian response, he said: \"Then they were talking about a storm and if you're trying to do tow with a badly damaged ship, it will make things a lot worse, but it's not stormy. It's flat and calm. I think this goes some way to disproving that allegation.\"\n\nFootage released by Russia's defence ministry over the Easter weekend showed the ship's crew back at their home base. However, the crew appeared to be at least one-half of the 510 members believed to have been onboard.\n\nIt is also unclear when the footage was taken, raising the possibility that it may have been captured before the Moskva was attacked.\n\nThe damage to the Russian flagship appears to have mostly been done to the amidships part of the cruiser, far away from some of the boat's main ordinances.\n\nThe smoke billowing from portholes and the open helicopter hangar suggest significant internal fire damage, perhaps indicating possible loss of life.\n\nIt is not clear whether the helicopter had a chance to be deployed before the crew were either killed or evacuated.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/hSlpNx9JorgHmjINr80bwlUNoxQ=/1200x675/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/K7XUJQJ3FKIUYR7Y57CNUECJNU.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7644527", "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 19, "stanza_neu": 16, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 35, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7007828865", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-18", "time": "10:06:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-18T10:06:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-18T09:30:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6078431606292725, "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com.au/new-images-show-moskva-listing-fire-debate-rages-over-crew-parade-video-1810278", "title": "New Images Show Moskva Listing And On Fire; Debate Rages Over Crew Parade Video", "body": "The Moskva, flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, pictured in August 2013\n\nNew images have emerged showing the severely damaged vessel Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, amid conflicting reports about how the vessel sank.\n\nWhile an image shows the Slava-class cruiser listing toward the port side, another shows the ship on fire, smoke emanating from it. Both images were doing rounds on social media Sunday.\n\nThough there is no official verification about the images, open-source intelligence analysts and trackers suggest that the photos appear to be authentic. International Business Times could not independently verify the images.\n\nUkraine claims the 40-year-old cruiser was hit by a Neptune anti-ship missile in the Black Sea. The Pentagon too has confirmed Ukraine's account of the casualty. A day later, Russia announced it had lost Moskva after it sunk while being towed to the port after an explosion.\n\nThe new images reportedly match closely with the previous images of Moskva and with the Ukrainian version of the vessel's sinking. According to The Drive, the damage to the vessel is clear with what appears to be a major scaring on its side, precisely where most anti-ship cruise missiles are supposed to hit. There is also damage below the water level.\n\nNear the area where the missile struck are P-500 or P-1000 anti-ship missiles in their armored launch tubes. The detonation of these missiles could cause major destruction, as well. The upper hull edges are seen scorched, which hints at fire damage inside. There are also suggestions that life rafts have been deployed. A couple of water cannons can be seen still running on the ship while two streams of water behind the ship may be from the monitors of a firefighting tug, said reports.\n\nHowever, there are some discrepancies too. Though Russia claims the ship sank while being towed back to her homeport of Sevastopol, the image hints at a calm sea. That said, it isn't clear when the images were taken and the weather could have changed throughout the day. Also conflicting is the fact that the cruiser does not appear to be making way undertow, as maintained by Russia.\n\nThis comes as Russian Defense Ministry recently published a video showing the meeting of Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov, Commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy, with the crew members of Moskva. While the 26-second video shows Yevmenov and two other officers standing outside in front of around 100 sailors on a parade ground, it provided no other details, triggering debates about the veracity of the video.\n\nDefense analyst H I Sutton posted on Twitter that he doesn't believe the footage was old. The footage showed that the captain was alive and there were 240 crew members in the video, \"so around 50 percent dead or injured,\" Sutton added. Many had reportedly claimed the video was fake and taken a year earlier.\n\nPhoto: AFP / Vasiliy BATANOV", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times AU"}, "authors": [{"uri": "meera_suresh@ibtimes.com.au", "name": "Meera Suresh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.ibtimes.com.au/sites/au.ibtimes.com/files/styles/large/public/2022/04/18/the-moskva-flagship-of-russias-black-sea-fleet.jpg?itok=-D7p1LQJ", "eventUri": "eng-7644527", "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 15, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 27, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7008438588", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-18", "time": "20:28:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-18T20:28:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-18T20:27:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6039215922355652, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/18/europe/ukraine-moskva-warship-sinking-images-intl/index.html", "title": "New photos show Russian warship Moskva before it sank", "body": "(CNN)New photos and a short video clip emerged early Monday on social media showing Russia's guided-missile cruiser, the Moskva, badly damaged and on fire in the hours before the ship sunk in the Black Sea on Thursday.\n\nThe sinking of the Black Sea fleet flagship was the biggest wartime loss of a naval ship in 40 years -- and a huge embarrassment for Russia.The images show the Moskva listing to one side, with black holes from possible missile puncture marks, and significant scarring at and just above the waterline on the port (left) side in the middle of the vessel.A large plume of black smoke can be seen billowing upwards, partly obscuring the front of the stricken ship.

However they bear witness to the extent of fire on the Russian warship, the latter becoming a potential threat to Ukrainian defiance during the initial days of the war.\n\nThe ongoing invasion of Ukraine has \"escalated into World War III\", a Russian television declared on Friday after the Russian warship sank in the Black Sea due to a massive blow. Presenter Olga Skabeyeva of Rossiya 1 stressed that Russia was fighting against NATO infrastructure.\n\nUkraine's two Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles hit 529-crew Moskva after which it sank. However, Russia denied this claim and stated that Moskva suffered damage from an accidental fire and ammunition explosion.\n\nThe US and other Western officials were unable to confirm what caused the blaze. Named for the Russian capital, Moskva's loss is a devastating symbolic defeat for Moscow as its troops regroup for a renewed offensive.\n\nFollowing the sinking of the vessel, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Ukrainians they should be proud of having survived 50 days under attack when the Russians \"gave us a maximum of five.\"\n\nWhat was Russian cruiser Moskva?\n\nLaunched during the Cold War, Moskva served during conflicts in n Georgia, Syria, and Ukraine pushing the Russian military forward. Equipped to carry 16 long-range cruise missiles, the warship was 611.5 feet (186 meters) long and housed a crew of 476 with an additional 62 officers.\n\nThe warship was launched as the Slava from a shipyard in Mykolaiv in what was then the Soviet republic of Ukraine in July 1979, according to open-source intelligence firm Janes. The Slava served as the flagship of the Soviet fleet in the Black Sea. It carried both surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, deck guns, torpedoes, and mortars. It also had a helicopter deck.\n\nThe Slava underwent repairs from 1990-1999. During that time, the Soviet Union collapsed, an independent Ukraine emerged and Russia's economy foundered. Finally overhauled and rechristened as the Moskva. During Russia's war in its former republic of Georgia in 2008, the Moskva took part in operations in the Black Sea, and Georgia said it was involved in an attack on the country.\n\nIn 2014, as Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula, the Moskva blocked Ukrainian naval vessels from leaving Lake Donuzlav. In 2015-16, it was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea to provide support for the Russian military campaign backing Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nIn February 2022, the cruiser left Sevastopol to participate in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The ship was later used against the Ukrainian armed forces during the attack on Snake Island, together with the Russian patrol boat Vasily Bykov. Moskva hailed the island's garrison over the radio and demanded its surrender, and was told \"Russian warship, go fuck yourself\".

The Moskva was being towed toward the Sevastopol port when it sank, the Russian defence ministry has said. \"These tugs are always around whatever the other warships are engaged,\" he said in a message.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry has released very little information about how the ship sank, claiming the damage to the boat was sustained in an accident on board. The Ukrainian government, along with western intelligence officials, say that the ship was hit by several Ukrainian anti-ship missiles.\n\nHI Sutton, a naval analyst and author, wrote that the \"damage does not rule out a missile strike(s), and it remains the likely cause. Possible puncture marks in the side of the hull are visible below where the fire is. But these would need closer examination to confirm whether they were caused by missiles, or are simply fire damage.\"\n\nThe Russian government claims that the ship sank in \"stormy seas\" while being towed to the port of Sevastopol. But the location of the fire could suggest that it reached the anti-ship or anti-air missiles, causing a \"catastrophic explosion\", Sutton wrote. There had previously been unconfirmed media reports of a large explosion aboard the ship.\n\nThe Russian government also has not confirmed any information about the number of casualties from the incident, releasing just a short video clip of the Russian Navy's top brass meeting with some members of the crew.\n\nThe absence of lifeboats onboard would suggest a considerable number of the crew could have been rescued.\n\n\"All of the aft life raft canisters have been jettisoned, although one remains on the aft deck,\" wrote Sutton. \"This suggests that the crew have already abandoned ship at this point.\"\n\nBut other reports in Russian independent media on Monday suggest that up to 200 sailors could have been wounded in the attack on the ship.

It says the warship then sank during a storm.\n\nNow, a short video and two images, uploaded by an unknown source or sources, appear to show the Moskva being escorted after sustaining damage. These images cast doubt on some of Russia's statements.\n\nIt has been identified by numerous naval experts as the flagship Moskva.\n\nYou can compare the ship in the photo with this image of the Moskva taken last year in Istanbul, with areas that match highlighted.\n\nThe archive photo also helps show how far the Moskva has begun to sink. The yellow line shows how high the waterline is in the recent photo being shared online.\n\nThis indicates the damaged Moskva has lost some buoyancy.\n\nThe new image also shows the damaged ship is noticeably leaning portside and towards the camera, whereas the archive photo shows the warship is sitting flat on the water.\n\nLooking further at the image of the damaged warship, we can see a large crack in the side of the Moskva and what appears to be fire damage.\n\nInfrastructure on the deck appears flattened and warped in places. Here is a direct comparison.\n\nThe Russian warship also seems to still be on fire in the image.\n\nAnalyst Oliver Alexander is one of a number of experts who highlight that the warship's rescue boats may have been deployed.\n\nThis indicates that those on board the warship had enough time to disembark the sinking ship using the lifeboats.\n\nThis supports the Russian Defence Ministry's statement that the crew were evacuated from the Moskva. However the image cannot tell us how many crew members may have escaped.\n\nDefence analyst H I Sutton shared this graphic labelling the different parts of the warship and highlighting the main areas of damage.\n\nWriting on his website, Mr Sutton says the limited evidence in the photos casts some doubt on Russia's claim a fire broke out, compared to Ukraine's claim that it struck the ship with missiles.\n\nHe writes: \"The damage does not rule out a missile strike(s), and it remains the likely cause. Possible puncture marks in the side of the hull are visible below where the fire is.\n\n\"But these would need closer examination to confirm whether they were caused by missiles, or are simply fire damage.\"\n\nA second image being shared online is much lower resolution and much of the vessel is hidden by smoke.\n\nSome of the key markings and infrastructure of the warship are visible, helping confirm it is also an image of the Moskva.\n\nWhat can a two-second video tell us?\n\nA short video clip began to circulate around the same time as the photos.\n\nSky News has removed the audio from the video, as a man can be heard shouting in Russian: \"Motherf*****! What the f*** are you doing?\" before the camera moves down and then turns off.\n\nThe video shows the weather was fairly settled when the clip was filmed. Some wind can be heard in the original audio but the sea is calm and no rain can be seen.\n\nThis contradicts a statement put out by the Russian Defence Ministry that the ship sank during a storm.\n\nA news report from Russian agency TASS on 14 April said: \"The Moskva missile cruiser sank while being towed amid storm because of hull damage sustained during the detonation of ammunition, Russian Defence Ministry said Thursday.\"\n\nWhere do the images and video come from?\n\nIt is not known who took the images or videos, or why there was a delay in them coming to light.\n\nThe ship sank on Thursday while being towed to the Crimean port of Sevastopol, according to the Russian Defence Ministry in a statement to the country's news agency TASS.\n\nHowever, the video and images only began to appear online on Sunday evening.\n\nA naval expert who uses the handle @GrangerE04117 on Twitter offers insight into why there was a delay in the images and videos appearing online.\n\nHe told Sky News: \"It took this long for images and videos to emerge because the crews of the tugboats probably recently returned to the home base in Sevastopol.\n\n\"Or if they did return immediately after the ship sank... the crew probably contemplated releasing videos of the ship immediately and just waited a few days.\"\n\nThe person who filmed and photographed the Moskva is unknown, but Yoruk Isik, an open source analyst with years of experience tracking ships, believes the photo may have been taken from a Russian rescue ship.\n\nThe video clip has been going viral on Russian social media. A watermark for a group with four million subscribers called \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u044f (Lightening) on messaging app Viber can be seen on the two-second clip.\n\nThis information suggests it may have been a Russian person who captured the last images of Russia's flagship missile cruiser.\n\nBefore Sky News republishes a social media video or image from the war in Ukraine our forensic journalists analyse the material.

Now for the first time there are pictures of the ship taken between the time the fire broke out and it sinking in the public domain that appear potentially genuine.\n\nLeaked to the wider world through the Telegram social media platform, the Daily Telegraph reports, at least one image and one short video appear to have emerged, both apparently taken from the same ship alongside the Moskva at around the same time.\n\nWhile little can be said for certain from the images, certain inferences can be drawn with some confidence. Taken in daylight, at least two ships are attending the Moskva, which is belching heavy black smoke. One of those standing off the Moskva's starboard quarter appears to be a seagoing tug.\n\nThe condition of the Moskva itself may be telling. There is evidence of an impact site, which would lend credence to Ukraine's missile attack claims -- already acknowledged as \"plausible and possible\" by the Pentagon last week -- roughly amidships.\n\nInterestingly, the external paint of the Moskva appears to be in good condition outside of the primary blast area. As seen during the Falklands War, for instance, a fire raging inside a ship heating the steel of the hull is enough to burn off the paint covering it, which will have a much lower combustion point of the metal. The fact this isn't present suggests the fire is was not yet well established at the time of the picture, had never burned hard, or that internal damage control teams were extremely effective.\n\nYet in the images seen, the Moskva appears to be totally abandoned. This sits well with Russia's claims immediately after the burning of the ship became known on Wednesday that it had been completely evacuated. Yet this also implies efforts to fight for the ship were extremely limited.\n\nIndeed, neither of the ships near the Moskva in these pictures are spraying it with water, and the only attempt at damage control visible is unattended hoses rigged on the aft tower spraying fore and aft, presumably for cooling.\n\nAs Breitbart reported last week, Russia admitted the Moskva subsequently sank while under tow. What casualties the attack on the ship caused have been speculated upon in Western media, with reports of unclaimed cars belonging to the ships' company lined up in Crimea, and even a headcount of Moskva sailors parading on land at the weekend showing it hundreds of men short.\n\nRussia has not yet moved from its position that the explosions onboard the Moskva were caused by a fire of indeterminate origin, the cause of which will be determined by an investigation. That will no doubt now be considerably hampered by the fact the primary evidence is now at the bottom of the Black Sea.\n\nIt remains the case the Russian state must decide whether it is more damaging for its prestige abroad, and for its credibility with its own citizens, to lose ships to Ukraine or lose ships to spontaneous explosions.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_jj_lane@breitbart.com", "name": "Oliver Jj Lane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/04/moskva3-e1650296517500.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7644527", "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 16, "stanza_neu": 3, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 21, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7008979154", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-19", "time": "08:33:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-19T08:33:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-19T07:16:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "url": "http://saudigazette.com.sa/article/619531/World/Europe/Dramatic-images-appear-to-show-sinking-Russian-warship-Moskva?ref=rss&format=simple&link=link", "title": "Dramatic images appear to show sinking Russian warship Moskva", "body": "LONDON -- Dramatic pictures -- and a credible video -- showing the Russian warship Moskva before it sank last week have appeared online.\n\nThe video and images match the shape and design of the missile cruiser.\n\nRussia says a fire onboard caused ammunition to explode and the vessel sank as it was being towed in a storm. Ukraine says it hit it with missiles.\n\nThe new images do not immediately back the claims of either side - but there is no sign of a storm at the time.\n\nThe images were allegedly taken on 14 April, a day after Ukraine claimed to have struck the warship.\n\nThe three-second video clip - likely taken from a rescue boat - shows the Moskva in the distance listing heavily on her port side.\n\nA tug, likely a Russian Shakhter, is on its right.\n\nSmoke can be seen billowing out of the ship, with a section of the freeboard heavily damaged.\n\nHoles are also visible in other parts of the freeboard in one picture, suggesting the warship had taken in a substantial amount of water.\n\nIt also appears all of the vessel's lifeboats had been deployed.\n\nUkraine says it successfully struck the Moskva with two recently-introduced Ukrainian-made Neptune missiles last Wednesday.\n\nUnnamed US officials have told US media they believe the Ukrainian version.\n\nRussia alleges it was damaged after an explosion and subsequently sank because of \"stormy seas\".\n\nThe BBC showed the footage to three naval experts who agreed the damage appeared consistent with a missile attack, but disagreed over whether other causes were still possible.\n\nJonathan Bentham, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, concluded that the vessel in the images was certainly a Slava-class cruiser and \"probably\" the Moskva.\n\nMr Bentham said the visible damage sustained by the cruiser looked like it may have been caused by a Neptune missile attack, but stressed it was not possible to rule out other causes at this stage.\n\n\"The smoke marks on the portside seem to be near the waterline. That might indicate sea-skimming missiles, which the Neptune missiles are reported to be,\" Bentham said.\n\nAnother expert, Rear Admiral Chris Parry, who previously commanded a Royal Navy destroyer, told the BBC he was sure the damage was caused by a missile strike.\n\n\"You can see a very jagged imploded ship's side,\" Rear Adm Parry said. \"If it was an internal explosion, you'd see plating sticking outwards rather than inwards. But this suggests penetration and subsequent explosion. No doubt it's been hit by one or two missiles.\"\n\nThe former Nato commander said one explanation for the extensive smoke damage was that missiles being stored onboard became punctured in a strike and leaked their fuel along the ship's decks, causing a devastating fire.\n\n\"You can see the decks are completely buckled, the whole ship looks like it's burnt out. I think the fuel has run along the decks, even down the back end,\" he suggested.\n\nAnother military expert, Sidharth Kaushal of the Royal United Services Institute, noted to the BBC that the main area of fire damage is \"where the ammunition for the ship's anti-aircraft guns are\".\n\n\"One working hypothesis is that a fire started by the initial strike cooked off the ammunition from the anti-aircraft guns,\" Kaushal said.\n\nWhile conditions can vary at different times, there's nothing in the video to confirm the Kremlin's initial assertion that the Moskva sank due to stormy conditions.\n\nPrior to the sinking, Russia's defense ministry issued a statement saying \"the vessel is seriously damaged. The entire crew have been evacuated\".\n\nThe BBC has not been able to verify the claims.\n\nRussia has also not admitted any casualties. On Saturday, the Russian defense ministry published footage showing what it described as the crew of the Moskva on parade in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol.\n\nThe 510-crew warship had led Russia's naval assault on Ukraine, which made it an important symbolic and military target.\n\nEarlier in the conflict the Moskva gained notoriety after calling on Ukrainian border troops defending Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender -- to which they memorably radioed a message of refusal which loosely translates as \"go to hell\". -- BBC", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi Gazette"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2022/04/19/1967768.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7644527", "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 17, "stanza_neu": 19, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 38, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7009526976", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-19", "time": "15:51:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-19T15:51:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-19T15:49:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5568627715110779, "url": "https://www.democraticunderground.com/100216608106", "title": "Families of crew aboard Russia's sunken warship Moskva have begun questioning the official line that", "body": "Families of crew aboard Russia's sunken warship Moskva have begun questioning the official line that it was fully evacuated\n\nRelatives of crew members aboard the sunken Russian warship Moskva say they haven't been able to locate their loved ones in the days since it went down.\n\nThe Moskva, a missile cruiser that was the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, sank on Thursday.

Analysts have said that the damage visible to the hull contradicts Russia's version of events.\n\nA thick column of black smoke can be seen rising from a charred and burning section of the Moskva, which is listing to port and has had its lifeboats deployed. Water hoses can also be seen spraying in the air, potentially from a nearby salvage vessel.\n\nThe continued buoyancy of the ship coupled with the absence of any of its 510 crew members on the upper decks potentially suggest that the captain may have left the ship too early.\n\nTom Sharpe, a retired commander in the Royal Navy who once helped save the UK's ice patrol vessel during a flood, told the Telegraph that the ship appeared to have been abandoned too soon.\n\nHe said: \"You will always see a team, normally on the flight deck. In this case, the flight deck would be a good place to gather your equipment and firefighting teams. You want to set up safe zones and that's where you put all your firefighting equipment and all your people, so they're in fresh air.\n\n\"But there's nobody there and if there is no one, there is almost no chance of anyone being alive below deck. It also suggests that everyone is off that ship,\" Sharpe added.\n\nJohn Konrad, an author who has captained civilian ships, wrote an analysis of the images that concluded that his \"best guess\" was that \"the captain of the Moskva abandoned his ship too early\".\n\nHe pointed out that the flagship was crucial to the Russian war effort and that normally, the captain would be expected to stay on board to try to save the ship.\n\nIn this case, the ship appeared to have been abandoned despite the \"calm weather, reserve buoyancy\" and \"the fact the helideck was smoke-free\", Konrad wrote.\n\nSharpe, however, said that there was too much uncertainty around the images to make this assertion with any certainty.\n\n\"You could just be unlucky,\" he said.\n\n\"You could take a massive detonation on another munition by the incoming missile and that rips out all your command and control, all your communications, all your systems and then you're done. At that point, you might as well get off, because there is nothing any of you can do.\"\n\nHe added, however, that the new images appeared to undermine Russia's account of how the Moskva met its fate.\n\n\"There are holes in the side of the ship that clearly look like missile entry points,\" Sharpe suggested.\n\nReferring to the Russian response, he said: \"Then they were talking about a storm and if you're trying to do a tow with a badly damaged ship, it will make things a lot worse, but it's not stormy. It's flat and calm. I think this goes some way to disproving that allegation.\"\n\nFootage released by Russia's defence ministry over the Easter weekend showed the ship's crew back at their home base. However, the crew appeared to be at least half of the 510 members believed to have been onboard.\n\nIt is also unclear when the footage was taken, raising the possibility that it may have been captured before the Moskva was attacked.\n\nThe damage to the Russian flagship appears to have mostly been done to the amidships part of the cruiser, far away from some of the boat's main ordinances.\n\nThe smoke billowing from portholes and the open helicopter hangar suggest significant internal fire damage, perhaps indicating possible loss of life.\n\nIt is not clear whether the helicopter had a chance to be deployed before the crew were either killed or evacuated.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/1GNR1uphpAAAUEmjcfUB42NWs-g=/1200x675/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/WXQVEADSCCCT4ZI2N75XABVVBQ.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7644527", "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 17, "stanza_neu": 15, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 32, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7007871451", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-18", "time": "10:47:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-18T10:47:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-18T10:46:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5529412031173706, "url": "https://www.skynews.com.au/world-news/global-affairs/first-pictures-reveal-damage-caused-by-alleged-ukrainian-missiles-inflicted-on-russias-flagship-missile-cruiser-moskva/news-story/4c75931197a992caded6c385b99ebea0", "title": "First pictures reveal damage inflicted on Russia's flagship missile cruiser Moskva", "body": "The first pictures of the damage inflicted on Russia's flagship missile cruiser Moskva shortly before it sank after an alleged attack from Ukrainian forces.\n\nUkrainian military reportedly used drones to distract hundreds of soldiers onboard Moskva before it launched two of its newest R-360 Neptune class anti-ship missiles into the warship causing it to explode into flames before it sank.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin's Black Sea flagship vessel can be seen leaning to port (left) and sitting low in the water with smoke billowing out of the command tower at the front of the ship.\n\nStream more global news with Flash. 25+ news channels in 1 place.

Analysts have said that the damage visible to the hull contradicts Russia's version of events.\n\nA thick column of black smoke can be seen rising from a charred and burning section of the Moskva, which is listing to port and has had its lifeboats deployed. Water hoses can also be seen spraying in the air, potentially from a nearby salvage vessel.\n\nThe continued buoyancy of the ship coupled with the absence of any of its 510 crew members on the upper decks potentially suggest that the captain may have left the ship too early.\n\nTom Sharpe, a retired commander in the Royal Navy who once helped save the UK's ice patrol vessel during a flood, told the Telegraph that the ship appeared to have been abandoned too soon.\n\nHe said: \"You will always see a team, normally on the flight deck. In this case, the flight deck would be a good place to gather your equipment and firefighting teams. You want to set up safe zones and that's where you put all your firefighting equipment and all your people, so they're in fresh air.\"\n\n\"But there's nobody there and if there is no one, there is almost no chance of anyone being alive below deck. It also suggests that everyone is off that ship,\" Mr Sharpe added.\n\nJohn Konrad, an author who has captained civilian ships, wrote an analysis of the images which concluded that his \"best guess\" was that \"the captain of the Moskva abandoned his ship too early\".\n\nHe pointed out that the flagship was crucial to the Russian war effort and that normally, the captain would be expected to stay on board to try to save the ship.\n\nIn this case, the ship appeared to have been abandoned despite the \"calm weather, reserve buoyancy\" and \"the fact the helideck was smoke-free,\" Mr Konrad wrote.\n\nMr Sharpe, however, said that there was too much uncertainty around the images to make this assertion with any certainty.\n\n\"You could just be unlucky,\" he said.\n\n\"You could take a massive detonation on another munition by the incoming missile and that rips out all your command and control, all your communications, all your systems and then you're done. At that point, you might as well get off, because there is nothing any of you can do,\" Mr Sharpe said.\n\nHe added, however, that the new images appeared to undermine Russia's own account of how the Moskva met its fate.\n\n\"There are holes in the side of the ship that clearly look like missile entry points,\" Mr Sharpe suggested.\n\nReferring to the Russian response, he said: \"Then they were talking about a storm and if you're trying to do a tow with a badly damaged ship, it will make things a lot worse, but it's not stormy. It's flat and calm. I think this goes some way to disproving that allegation.\"\n\nFootage released by Russia's defence ministry over the Easter weekend showed the ship's crew back at their home base.

While Ukraine and Russia continue to offer differing accounts for the ship's damage, the debunked video is the latest example of misinformation that has clouded the conflict.\n\nUkraine's military last week proclaimed that it had successfully launched Neptune missiles at the Moskva, badly damaging the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet and striking a major blow against the invading country's military. Russian military officials blamed damage to the Soviet-era ship on a fire caused by the detonation of ammunition that occurred while it was being towed.\n\nOne video making its rounds on social media claimed to capture the dramatic aftermath of the Ukrainian missile strike. However, WebQoof, The Quint's fact-checking service, compared the viral video with older footage. It found the video claiming to be the Moskva was actually from 2019 and shows a ship flying the flag of Tanzania in the Black Sea.\n\n\"We matched the visuals from the 2019 video and compared it with the viral video and found that a green screen was added and the original video was flipped,\" according to WebQoof.\n\nReferencing past reporting, WebQoof reports that the original video shows two ships with Indian, Turkish and Libyan crewmembers catching fire in the strategically significant Kerch Strait, which separates Crimea from Russia. The fire broke out on the ships, both flying Tanzania's flag, killing 14 sailors. One ship was a liquified natural gas carrier and the other a tanker.\n\nMoskva was made famous early in the Russia-Ukraine War after Ukrainian border guards risked their lives by defiantly cursing the ship's crew and refusing to surrender.

But authorities have told families of crewmembers that their relatives are \"missing in action.\" Russians have taken to social media to question the whereabouts of their missing family members.\n\nThe Moskva is the third-largest in Russia's fleet, and was reportedly being used as a weapons store for its military's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

Naval history could now shift dramatically: It was the blub blub blub heard 'round the world. On April 15, Russia acknowledged the missile cruiser Moskva, its Black Sea flagship, had sunk while being towed back to port, having been crippled by explosions and ensuing fires. Ukraine claimed that it had hit the ship with two R-360 Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles. Russia disputed the claim, however, the Pentagon corroborates Ukraine's version.\n\nRussia's denials notwithstanding, the incident has profound implications, not just for Russia's war of aggression on its neighbor, but also for the way global naval forces operate and the risks they take.\n\nIt's been 40 years since a ship comparable in size to the 611-meter Moskva was sunk by a hostile force. In 1982, Argentine light cruiser ARA General Belgrano was torpedoed by the Royal Navy submarine Conqueror during the 10-day Falklands War. The last time the world saw hostile ship sinkings and naval warfare on a broader scale was in World War II. Since then, the U.S. and other world powers have been developing and maintaining navies that are hardened and equipped for war, but likely to spend their entire service lives without seeing a peer sea battle.\n\nMoskva's problematic set-up\n\nHow Moskva fared contains lessons on ship design as well as fleet employment, said Jerry Hendrix, a senior fellow with the Sagamore Institute and a retired Navy captain.\n\nMoskva was rendered ineffective by a deck fire made more damaging when it reached the ship's above-deck missile tubes. The Slava-class cruiser design incorporates 16 launchers for the P-500 Bazalt supersonic cruise missile situated on each side of the ship's superstructure. Those unprotected missiles can have the effect of friendly fire under the right circumstances.\n\n\"Because [the launch tubes] are above deck, it makes them extremely vulnerable to damage and to fragmentation, and then causing damage to its own ship if the ship is hit first,\" Hendrix told Sandboxx.\n\n\"If the ship does not fire off all of its missiles before it is hit... that missile then has congruences where it cooks off other missiles around it, and the ship virtually self-destructs because of the way it was designed,\" he added.\n\nBy comparison, the U.S. Navy's Ticonderoga-class cruisers house their missile tubes below deck. That allows the crew to flood the magazines in case of a fire. This renders the missiles safe in their housings and prevents a disastrous chain reaction, Hendrix explained.\n\nNonetheless, Hendrix said, the U.S. should heed the lessons of the Moskva and look for opportunities to move external armaments inside the skin of their warships. The Boeing-made, over-the-horizon Harpoon missile, for example, can be housed in above-deck launchers. It has been deployed in that configuration aboard a littoral combat ship and in some older surface ships.\n\nOperating opposite hostile shores\n\nPerhaps more significantly, Moskva's sinking highlights the necessity of distributed operations in a world where peer and near-peer naval conflict is a real possibility.\n\nNamed for Russia's capital city, Moskva was too much ship for the mission it was given in the Black Sea, Hendrix said. That underscores the value of smaller ships and right-sized missions over bold show-of-force displays.\n\n\"One of the things that we often say is, never send a cruiser to do what a frigate is supposed to do. This is a frigate mission; the Black Sea is a constrained water space. And really, there's not an anti-ship cruise missile mission here,\" Hendrix added. \"So why is the Moskva in the Black Sea at this point in time? It's more about prestige. And so, because [the Russians] risked their prestige, they have lost their prestige with this.\"\n\nAs the U.S. Navy moves forward with plans to build at least 20 new Constellation-class frigates, the successor to the beleaguered LCS, Hendrix suggests that it should also think about operating in a distributed manner. Navy and Marine Corps leaders have for years promoted the concept of Distributed Maritime Operations and Expeditionary Advanced Basing Operations as a way to be more effective across a vast operating area such as the Pacific. Traditionally, though, the Navy deploys with carrier strike groups composed of five or six surface ships clustered around a flattop for defense.\n\n\"We're having a very strong conversation now [...] about how we disaggregate our force, spread it out across a broad ocean area, not all concentrated together, and then be able to quickly aggregate together to give sort of a compressed pulse of lethality,\" Hendrix said. \"So we're working [on] these types of issues. But it's all based upon the idea that the enemy is going to have a lot of these anti-ship cruise missiles ashore, and it's going to be very hard to operate anywhere near them.\"\n\nThings are getting worse for Russia\n\nFor Russia, the Moskva's sinking is the latest in a series of strategic setbacks: The deputy commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, Captain 1st Rank Andrei Nikolayevich Paly, was reportedly killed in combat in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol in March. Ukrainian officials say seven Russian generals have been killed in the fighting, though not all deaths are confirmed. After a lengthy assault on Kyiv, Russian troops withdrew from the city earlier this month without having gained control of it.\n\n\"I think that the military in Russia is increasingly looking at this as they're being bled out,\" Hendrix said. \"The Slava class is a major capital asset - it's a large portion of their navy and their budget. So I think that there's going to be increased pressure inside the Russian military to re-examine this war and how it's being executed.\"\n\nEven the specific loss of the Moskva is significant: early in the conflict, Russian naval forces had attacked Ukraine's Snake Island which was defended by a few dozen Ukrainian troops. In a recorded exchange, a Ukrainian border guard refused to surrender, saying, \"Russian warship, go f -- yourself.\"\n\nThat ship was Moskva.", "source": {"uri": "19fortyfive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "19FortyFive"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.19fortyfive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Moskva-1024x576.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7644527", "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 38, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 51, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7008088095", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-18", "time": "14:10:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-18T14:10:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-18T14:10:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5333333611488342, "url": "https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/sinking-of-russias-moskva-flagship-the-resonance-continues.html", "title": "Sinking of Russia's Moskva Flagship - the Resonance Continues - KyivPost - Ukraine's Global Voice", "body": "Russia's Moskva cruiser vessel, the Black Sea Fleet's flagship, which sank on April 14.\n\nUkrainian forces hit Russia's flagship Moskva cruiser with two home-produced Neptune missiles on April 13 and sank it.

The crew was completely evacuated. The causes of the fire are being established, \" the Russian Ministry of Defense said in a statement quoted by TASS. The Moskva sank in the early hours of April 14.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defense believes that this attack will force Russia to reconsider its position in the Black Sea, as the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet played a key role as both a command ship and an air defense unit.\n\nForbes journalist David Aix wrote on Twitter that Russia had lost half of its military capability in the Black Sea zone due to the Moskva's sinking. It was a big loss for the Russian military capacity and its morale. Russia has lost half of its firepower at the hands of Ukraine and cannot regain it without entering into a war with NATO, Aix wrote. In an earlier article written by Aix in January 2022, he noted that the missiles on the Moskva would be enough to destroy the entire Ukrainian fleet.\n\nThe sinking prompted a strong reaction in Russian society, and it may actually prove be a turning point in the war. One of the main Russian TV propagandists Olga Skabeeva even began to refer what Russia had named its \"special operation' against Ukraine - \"the Third World War against NATO and its infrastructure.\"\n\nCalls for revenge, even nuclear strike\n\nDespite the fact that Russia has not formally acknowledged that the cruiser was attacked by Ukrainian missiles, its destruction is being presented as a \"prete\" for all-out war. Public figures are publicly calling for a retaliatory strike against Kyiv, including the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nIn a two-minute video, ex-State Duma deputy Vladimir Bortko shouted that certain 'events' that took place on the night of April 13-14 are a reason to declare war on Ukraine.\n\n\"I will not talk about what happened. These events are different... But even the fact that there is encroachment on our territory is a 'casus belli', an absolute, real reason for war. No fools. The special military operation is over! It ended tonight, and it ended up attacking our homeland!\" Bortko shouted.\n\nAnother propagandist, TV presenter Vladimir Solovyov, demanded that the Russian Ministry of Defense report on the sinking. On his Soloviev Live program, he said that the loss of the Black Sea Fleet's flagship had driven him into a frenzy.\n\nWell-known Russian film director and public figure Nikita Mikhalkov, appearing on the TV program with Skabeeva, demanded a retaliatory strike on Kyiv.\n\nIlya Kiva, a former Ukrainian MP with outspoken pro-Russian views, called for a nuclear strike on Ukraine. Writing in his Telegram channel, he said that the use of weapons of mass destruction by the Russian Armed Forces against Ukrainians would enable Moscow to not only win the war, but also \"to put an end to the confrontation with the West,\" which, according to the former parliamentarian, is actively involved in a full-scale armed conflict on the territory of \"our\" country.

The smoke billowing from portholes and the open helicopter hanger suggest there was significant internal fire damage, perhaps explaining the possible loss of life.\n\nIt is not clear whether the helicopter had a chance to be deployed before the crew were either killed or evacuated.\n\nA thick column of black smoke appears rising from a charred and burning section of the Moskva, which is listing to port and has had its lifeboats deployed.\n\nWater hoses can be seen spraying in the air, potentially from a nearby salvage vessel.\n\nThe continued buoyancy of the ship, coupled with the absence of any of the 510 crew members on the upper decks, potentially indicate the captain may have left the Moskva too early.\n\nTom Sharpe, a retired commander in the British navy who once helped save the UK's ice patrol vessel during a flood, said the ship appeared to have been abandoned too soon.\n\nHe said: \"You will always see a team, normally on the flight deck - in this case, the flight deck would be a good place to gather your equipment and firefighting teams.\n\n\"You want to set up safe zones and that's where you put all your firefighting equipment and all your people, they're in fresh air.\n\n\"But there's nobody, literally nobody there and if there is no one, there is almost no chance of anyone being alive below deck. It also suggests that everyone is off that ship.\"\n\nJohn Konrad, an author who has captained civilian ships, wrote an analysis of the images which concluded his \"best guess is the captain of the Moskva abandoned his ship too early\". He pointed out that the flagship was crucial to the Russian war effort and the captain would normally be expected to stay on board to try to save the ship.\n\nIn this case, the ship appeared to have been abandoned despite the \"calm weather, reserve buoyancy\" and \"the fact the helideck was smoke-free\", Mr Konrad wrote.\n\nBut Mr Sharpe said there was too much uncertainty about the images to make this assertion with any certainty.\n\n\"You could just be unlucky,\" he said. \"You could take a massive detonation on another munition by the incoming missile and that rips out all your command and control, all your comms, all your systems and then you're done.\n\n\"At that point, you might as well get off, because there is nothing any of you can do.\"\n\nHe added, however, that the images appeared to undermine Russia's own account about how the Moskva met its fate.

Its sinking and the unverified circumstances around the explosion -- Ukraine said it hit the ship with missiles, Russia said ammunition damaged the ship and it sank in a stormy sea -- quickly led to an appetite for anything that might show what really happened.\n\nMost of the claims were quickly debunked by professional news organizations and amateur analysts, often referred to as the open-source intelligence community (OSINT for short). In some, the ship didn't match the Moskva's profile. Others were quickly found to be old videos.\n\nBut a couple of pictures that emerged in recent days are different. Images and a short video appeared to show thick black smoke billowing from a warship bearing a striking resemblance to the Moskva.\n\nThe photos were new. The ship was clearly a Slava-class cruiser, of which the Moskva was one of three. By using archive photos, the NBC News Social Newsgathering team matched the shape and infrastructure of the ship -- including its dome-shaped fire-control radar, helicopter hangar, helipad and distinctive dark gray paint.\n\nSome lingering doubts remain. NBC News could not determine who originally took the video or images, or why they are only being shared now. The Pentagon has also said the images cannot be verified.\n\nBut experts who spoke with NBC News said they believed that the photos, assuming they have not been doctored, showed the Moskva. The photos showed no signs of alteration.\n\nJames Stavridis, a retired U.S. Navy admiral, said there was a high chance that they showed the Russian vessel.\n\n\"In today's world, with the ability to produce deep fakes of just about anything, I wouldn't bet my life on an assessment,\" he said.\n\n\"I would say this is in fact the Moskva. It certainly appears to be a Slava-class cruiser. They are utterly distinctive with the missile tubes up forward.

Patrick Kulakowski, a military professor at the Russia Maritime Studies Institute at the U.S. Naval War College, offered a similar assessment.\n\n\"I don't know if anything is doctored, but that is a Slava class,\" he said. \"They only have three of them, and we know that [the other two] are alive and well.\"\n\nThe NBC News Social Newsgathering team also noted that one of the images circulating online showed the ship noticeably leaning portside and that a rescue tugboat could be faintly seen behind the Moskva spraying two streams of water into the air.\n\nA low-quality, three-second video also showed a similar scene of the warship on fire, as a tugboat approached the vessel.\n\nThe recording ended abruptly when a man yells in Russian: \"What the f--- are you doing?\"", "source": {"uri": "news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ppYVwoTFjp8gWVpQ71zyOQ--~B/aD01MTA7dz02ODA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbc_news_122/a9dd6e277ad51d949cb846f42056f3a5", "eventUri": "eng-7644527", "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 8, "stanza_neu": 25, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 34, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7007934831", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-18", "time": "11:44:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-18T11:44:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-18T11:44:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.529411792755127, "url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-aud-nw-russia-ukraine-20220418-cmjasxuzinchvfmmx6yfg45aw4-story.html", "title": "Russian missiles kill at least 7 in Lviv, Ukrainian officials say", "body": "After the humiliating sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet last week in what the Ukrainians boasted was a missile attack, the Kremlin had vowed to step up strikes on Ukraine's capital.\n\nUkraine says it hit the Russian warship Moskva with two Neptune missiles; Russia said only that it sank while being towed after a fire.

Authorities in Russia have been extremely tight-lipped about what happened to the ship and those on board, even as pictures and video footage that appears to show it heavily damaged have begun to emerge, something you can read more about here.\n\nSome families of sailors assigned to Moskva say they have now received notifications from Russia's Ministry of Defense that their loved ones either perished or survived, but many more say they have received no such confirmations. It has now been more than three days since the cruiser sank in the Black Sea, which happened after it was struck by two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles, according to officials in Ukraine and the United States.\n\nSeparately, Russian forces carried out a new round of missile strikes targeting military and other sites in the far western Ukrainian city of Lviv, which lies just around 40 miles from the Polish border, killing at least seven people and injuring 12 more. Even before the conflict began, Lviv had become a major hub for military and humanitarian aid, foreign diplomatic activity, and refugees fleeing fighting in the eastern part of the country.\n\nWARNING: Some of the updates below contain graphic material.\n\nBefore getting into the latest updates below, The War Zone readers can first get fully up to speed on how the conflict has evolved already through our previous rolling coverage here.\n\nThe Latest\n\nPOSTED: 3:25 PM EST --\n\nMultiple outlets reported today that Yulia Tsyvova, a resident of Crimea, had told them that the Russian Ministry of Defense had informed her of the death of her son, Andrei Tsyvova, said to have been a member of Moskva's crew. Tsyvova said that she received no additional information about what exactly happened to Andrei, who was initially said to have been missing after the ship sank, including any potential funeral arrangements.\n\n\"I am sure he isn't the only one who died,\" Tsyvova said during a phone call, according to The Guardian newspaper. She made similar remarks while speaking to the BBC's Russian-language service.\n\nSo far, the Russian Ministry of Defense has not provided an official tally of the dead and wounded. There were reportedly around 500 personnel on the ship when it suffered a fire and explosion last week, which were the result of a strike involving Ukraine's domestically-developed shore-based Neptune anti-ship missile, according to Ukrainian and American authorities.\n\nYesterday, the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, which stopped operating in the country in March amid pressure from state censors, reported that a mother of a different sailor had told the outlet that at least around 40 members of Moskva's crew had died. She said that information had come from her son, who survived and who also told her that three Neptune missiles had struck the ship, rather than two as has been widely reported.\n\nOther estimates, based on an official video showing surviving members of Moskva's crew, have indicated that the losses could be substantially higher. Other reports say that some families have been able to find their loved ones among some 200 injured members of the cruiser's crew, including burn victims, now receiving treatment at a military hospital on the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula. Moskva was the flagship of the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet, which is currently headquartered in Crimea.\n\nIt's unclear whether or not the Russian government even knows yet how many members of Moskva's crew have died. Andrei Tsyvova is not the only sailor to have been listed as missing.\n\n\"A conscript who isn't supposed to see active fighting is among those missing in action,\" Dmitry Shkrebets, father of Yegor Shkrebets, said to be one of Moskva's cooks, wrote online, according to The Guardian. \"Guys, how can you be missing in action in the middle of the high seas?!!!\"\n\nThe matter of conscripted sailors being on the ship may further complicate matters. Since the very beginning of the conflict, Russian authorities have sought to obscure the participation of conscripts, including reportedly by forcing individuals to sign formal service contracts. Russian President Vladimir Putin had previously pledged that no conscripts would be deployed to Ukraine, despite clear evidence that they have been taking part in the fighting there since the start.\n\nBereaved and aggrieved families are likely to be one important source of information about what actually happened to Moskva last week. Details have been otherwise slow to trickle out so far. A senior U.S. defense official said today that American authorities cannot yet independently verify a video that appears to show the cruiser after the reported missile strike, but that the damage is in line with previous assessments.\n\nSeparately, authorities in the western city of Lviv have confirmed that a number of Russian cruise missiles struck multiple sites earlier today, including military-related infrastructure and a tire repair garage. Citing operational security concerns, they declined to elaborate on the exact nature of the military targets. A number of individuals, including civilians, died or were wounded in the strikes.\n\nImagery from the aftermath of the strikes suggests that railway infrastructure was among the targets. This would sense given that Lviv is a major transshipment point for foreign military aid, which is then moved elsewhere in the country by various means including via rail. There have been reports that commercial automotive facilities in Ukraine have been working to repair or otherwise modify military vehicles and weapons, which could offer one explanation for the strike on the tire repair shop.\n\nUkrainian authorities have released a video wherein detained pro-Russian oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk asks to be traded for both the safe passage of military forces and civilians out of the strategic southern port city of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov. Mariupol continues to be subjected to a withering weeks-long Russian seige as Ukrainian Marines and members of the controversial neo-Nazi-linked volunteer Azov Battalion continue to hold out in an area around the Azovstal iron and steel works.\n\nTwo British nationals who were captured while fighting for the Ukrainian armed forces have appeared on Russian state media making their own appeals, very possibly under duress, to be swapped for Medvedchuk. The oligarch, a long-time Putin ally in Ukraine, had skipped out on his house arrest after the Russian military launched its all-out invasion in Febraury. He was already under indictment for treason before the conflict began.\n\nThe Russian government announced today that it had the country's 64th Motor Rifle Brigade had designated a \"Guards\" unit, an honorific title given to formations that have distinguished themselves in combat. The official notice from the Kremlin said that the brigade had shown \"mass heroism protecting the fatherland, Russia's sovereignty, and its national interests.\" This unit is also among those that Ukrainian authorities say were directly responsible for the massacre of civilians in the town of Bucha outside of the capital Kyiv, one of a growing number of alleged Russian war crimes committed during this conflict.\n\nWe will continue to update this post with new information until we state otherwise.\n\nContact the author: joe@thedrive.com", "source": {"uri": "thedrive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Drive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_trevithick@thedrive.com", "name": "Joseph Trevithick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://swp.thedrive.com/uploads/2022/04/18/moskva-crew-russia-ukraine-conflict.jpg?auto=webp", "eventUri": "eng-7644527", "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 22, "stanza_neu": 30, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 52, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7008050069", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-18", "time": "13:33:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-18T13:33:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-18T13:33:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5215686559677124, "url": "https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-crisis/moskva-first-images-of-sunken-russian-navy-fleet-emerge-online-amid-ongoing-ukraine-war-articleshow.html", "title": "Moskva: First images of sunken Russian navy fleet emerge online amid ongoing Ukraine war", "body": "Amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, new photographs of the final days of the Russian Black Sea naval flagship, Moskva, have appeared online. This comes only days after the cruiser was sunk by Ukrainian force on April 14. While the images are yet to be authenticated, they indicate the magnitude of the firing on the Russian cruiser by the Ukrainian forces. The images, which appear to have been shot from a rescue vessel beside the crippled Russian battleship, show damage to the left side of the vessel, as well as flames burning below deck and a heavy pall of black smoke billowing into the sky.\n\nMeanwhile, Kremlin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was unable to assess the accuracy of the photographs, that circulated on social media, which purportedly represented a fire on the cruiser Moskva. \"We really saw the footage, but we cannot say how authentic and true it is,\" he stated, as per the TASS news agency. In the photographs, the Moskva is seen sitting low in the water, tilting to the port side, with its lifeboats deployed but no personnel visible on board. The port side of the ship is scarred by numerous black scars, including some near deck level where smoke appears to have flowed out of portholes and left marks on the paint. However, there are black stains along the waterline that don't match the position of the portholes, implying that the ship has been damaged from the outside.\n\nMoskva, which was launched during the Cold War, pushed the Russian military forward during conflicts in Georgia, Syria, and Ukraine. The destroyer, which was 611.5 feet (186 metres) long and housed a crew of 476 with an additional 62 officers, was equipped to carry 16 long-range cruise missiles. According to open-source intelligence firm Janes, the battleship was launched as the Slava from a shipyard in Mykolaiv in what was then the Soviet republic of Ukraine in July 1979. In the Black Sea, the Slava served as the Soviet fleet's flagship. It has surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, as well as deck guns, torpedoes, and mortars. There was also a helicopter deck on board.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that Moskva was declared nonfunctioning and out of sight after catching massive fire last week.

Each has the 121 painted on both sides as this is what this Slava Class Cruiser looks like. There are four of them. One is unfinished in Ukraine, the Admiral Ustinov serves in the Northern Fleet, the Varyag serves in the Pacific Fleet and the Moskva serves in the Black Sea Fleet.\n\nThe Lame Cherry is going to show you some photos of the damaged ship from the links below and show you something no one else is noting.\n\nThe Lame Cherry has highlighted some areas for you to compare in the real Moskva.\n\nThe first photo below in the set has the ship number 121. The other two ships have no numbers.\n\nThe first radar tower or bridge is square on the Moskva. The second photo has not any square bridge tower, nor does the last burning ship.\n\nLastly in the first photo, the aft section of the Moskva is straight. In the second and third photo, the aft of those ships has been cut away.\n\nIn the second photo the bridge tower does not match the first Moskva. The aft hanger deck compartment does not match the first Moskva and the 3rd photo's compartment shows a more rectangular compartment to the more square second photo.\n\nIn assessment, the top photo is the real Moskva. There is record of this ship undergoing repairs, but repairs are not complete structural changes of bridge and aft compartments.\n\nThe real Moskva in photo one is the real Moskva. It appears that the ships in Photo 2 and 3 are like class ships, but different than the Moskva. The \"sinking Moskva\" though does not match the second photo as it looks like a non completed ship.\n\nAs I was typing this exclusive, this story popped up from India.\n\nThe 3 active Slava class ships all look like the Moskva. They are mirror images of each other. Thee only Slava that looks anything like the burning ship in the cut away is the one in the Ukrainian port called the Ukrayina\n\nThat ship has a cut away aft section too and resembles the incomplete bridge structure.\n\nOne video making its rounds on social media claimed to capture the dramatic aftermath of the Ukrainian missile strike. However, WebQoof, The Quint's fact-checking service, compared the viral video with older footage. It found the video claiming to be the Moskva was actually from 2019 and shows a ship flying the flag of Tanzania in the Black Sea.\n\nI have informed all of you that the Ukrainians like like Goddamn dogs all the time. Thee American press is fed lies from the Pentagon and State.\n\nThe photos stating the burning and listing ship is the Moskva are not the same ship as the Moskva which was confirmed.\n\nRussia has produced some puzzling situations too in showing only 100 sailors \"off the Moskva\" for a ceremony, and not mentioning where the hundreds of others are. Russia is quite capable of gaming people in their nation and the world. Word had it that Ukraine was using Elon Musk's SatNet to coordinate this attack.\n\nIt puzzles the Lame Cherry with Russian reports of loose Ukraine mines in the Black Sea why the Russian ships would be operating in that kind of danger and with Neptune missiles why the Moskva would be ordered within range of those missiles.\n\nAt this moment, I would guess that Russia either obtained some Ukrainian derelict or Russia had somewhere an unfinished ship, and got it running or towed it to Odessa, as a decoy to be shot at by Ukraine, knowing they were being goaded by the United States to take out the Russian flag ship.\n\nThe British and Americans used sunken ships as propaganda to con thee American public into two world wars. It would be possible Russia used a fake incident to galvanize Russians to an escalation of severe tactics to finish off Ukraine or perhaps to serve up an atomic counterstrike against a British naval group.\n\nSomething is not adding up in this. I do not believe the Moskva was hit nor is it sunk on the bottom of the Black Sea.\n\nEach day thee American People are being suckered by everyone on sunset closer to being nuked.\n\nThis is another Lame Cherry exclusive in matter anti matter.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "image": "http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/11280256-thumb-300x225.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7644527", "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 19, "stanza_neu": 23, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 43, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7008269578", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-18", "time": "17:12:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-18T17:12:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-18T17:11:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.501960813999176, "url": "https://theweek.com/briefing/daily-briefing/1012606/10-things-you-need-to-know-today-april-15-2022", "title": "10 things you need to know today: April 15, 2022", "body": "The Moskva, Russia's Black Sea flagship, pictured in 2008 near Sevastopol\n\nThe flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, the guided-missile cruiser Moskva, sank Thursday as it was being towed to port after being damaged by explosions.

The symbolism of the sinking of a major naval ship is deeply complex and import-laden the world over. Military history is replete with tales of major naval battles and how the loss of a single ship or a flotilla altered the asymmetry of that particular encounter and perhaps impacted the larger war that the nation in question was engaged in.\n\nThe image of a major surface combatant -- such as a heavy cruiser like the Moskva (12,500 tons) or an aircraft carrier or a sleek destroyer -- steaming into action with the (national) colours hoisted evokes an emotive sentiment of the heroic warrior of yore astride his noble steed going into battle. Names of ships are often embossed and internalised in the national consciousness. Hood for the British, the Bismarck for Germany, Belgrano for Argentina and the Khukri in the Indian case are illustrative.\n\nThe sinking of the Moskva whether due to a strike by a Ukrainian missile or a raging fire and the sympathetic explosion of ammunition is moot. But the impact in Russia has been one of considerable shock and dismay. President Putin is reported to have a special association with the Russian navy and the Moskva in particular. Russian state television reported the loss of the Moskva sorrowfully and invoked the spectre of World War III. A well-known news presenter, Olga Skabeyeva, gravely informed her viewers of the sinking of the ship and added: \"What it escalated into can safely be called World War III.\" The anchor further stated: \"Now we're definitely fighting against NATO infrastructure, if not NATO itself. We need to recognise that.\"\n\nWhether this grim prognosis will unfold depends on how President Putin responds to the loss of the Moskva but it is evident that this development has come as a huge morale booster for Ukraine and its beleaguered President Zelenskyy. The Moskva had acquired a degree of notoriety for Ukrainians who saw it as a symbol of Russian oppression and intimidation. Sending it to the bottom of the Black Sea by adroit use of drones (as a decoy to confound the formidable anti-missile defence systems on the Moskva) and accurate cruise missile attacks is being interpreted as a vindication of Ukrainian resolve, innovation and chutzpah. The triumphant victory slogan among Ukrainians is that the Russian bear has been maimed.\n\nMany tactical lessons will be gleaned from the sinking of the Moskva when more credible information is available. However, a preliminary analysis would suggest that the Russian navy's deployment and protection of its major surface assets in the Black Sea against a determined adversary were inadequate. Drones and cruise missiles are now par for the course and more recent wars and skirmishes in both West Asia and Eurasia/Central Europe have seen the use of such unmanned platforms and precision-guided munitions.\n\nSome commentators are claiming this to be the beginning of the end of the big surface ship. But such certitude would be both hasty and misleading. The Moskva was designed in the mid-1970s and was an \"old\" ship. The density of ordnance fitted on the upper deck was always deemed to be very high as compared to more modern warships and these are issues that will be scrutinised by professionals.\n\nFor India, there are many strands related to the Moskva that will merit review. Foolproof missile defences have always been an elusive military objective and from the Patriot systems deployed in the first Gulf war (for Kuwait) in 1990-91 to the claims now being made about the current technology, the hit ratio is often burnished to a fault.\n\nMilitary planners are seized of this challenge -- the vulnerability of a major platform at sea against the advent of the nimble, unmanned aerial platform and the stealthy lethality of the latest missiles. Moskva and its final damage control grapple before it sank will provide valuable cues for professionals.\n\nAnother area that may warrant tentative comment is the quality of the human resource (HR) of the Russian military -- and its navy in particular. Media reports suggest that many of the Russian military personnel pressed into the Ukraine war are recent conscripts and have short periods of service. It is not evident yet as to whether or not Moscow has sent its battle-hardened elite troops into this \"special operation\". But the current setbacks would indicate that short tenures with minimal training to reduce standing costs are not conducive to the kind of hybrid warfare unspooling in the Ukraine war.\n\nIndia is grappling with similar challenges -- of seeking to reduce the size of its manpower-intensive army through short tenures for soldiers -- and thereby ensure fiscal savings and consolidation. The efficacy of such policies may be culled from the Ukraine war, as and when it concludes -- hopefully without escalating into the major global conflagration that has been so dramatically unveiled on Russian television.\n\nThe writer is Director, Society for Policy Studies, New Delhi", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/04/Moksva-2022-04-14T081851Z_148892991_RC2EEO9QPTBR_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-RUSSIA-SHIP.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7644527", "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 22, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 37, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7009605485", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-19", "time": "16:58:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-19T16:58:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-19T16:51:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4862745106220245, "url": "https://gvwire.com/2022/04/19/how-ukrainian-neptune-missiles-sank-the-mighty-russian-moskva-ship/", "title": "How Ukrainian Neptune Missiles Sank the Mighty Russian Moskva Ship - GV Wire - Explore.

For the Russians, you would have to go back to World War II to find a comparable loss.\n\nHow will this dramatic event affect the war in Ukraine? And what are the lessons for navies worldwide?\n\nI have toured Russian ships on several occasions (including in Sevastopol before the Russian invasion), and the surface ships produced in the 1970s and 1980s, like the Slava-class Moskva, have several weaknesses in construction and manning.\n\nThe most noticeable deficiency is a lack of the sort of combat compartmentation built into U.S. and other Western warships. Instead of multiple watertight doors that can be slammed shut when a ship is at general quarters (all hands manning their battle stations), Russian ships have little ability to divide up internally -- making them far more vulnerable to what is called \"progressive flooding,\" a euphemism for sinking.\n\nAnother key shortcoming, which surprised me, is the lack of a strong corps of mid-grade professionals in the Russian navy crews. Called chief petty officers in the U.S. Navy, these are sailors with 10-15 years of seagoing experience who lead the sailors on the deck. They are the backbone of the U.S. Navy, and the absence of such a cadre is a major problem for the Russians. (The same weakness -- a lack of strong noncommissioned officers -- exists in the Russian land forces, a major factor in the problems they are encountering ashore since the Feb. 24 invasion.)\n\nI recently compared notes on the Ukraine sea war with a retired U.S. surface-warfare captain. He reminded me that when he toured a Russian cruiser, the officers wore name tags on their uniforms, while the sailors wore only numbers. This mentality -- a reminder that the Russian fleet is in part composed of conscripts -- reflects a lack of a coherent chain of command. That can work in peacetime operations, but quickly breaks down in combat.\n\nIn the case of the Moskva, we don't have the accurate reporting to fully evaluate the failures, but a couple of points stand out.\n\nMost obviously, the readiness of the ship to defend itself from two incoming Ukrainian Neptune cruise missiles (now confirmed by U.S. intelligence) was flawed. Whether that stemmed from a lax \"watch standing\" -- meaning the sailors weren't at proper battle stations -- or that the ship's anti-air defenses were technologically insufficient, we may never know. In all likelihood, it was a combination of both.\n\nAdditionally, the ability of the ship to take a punch and keep itself afloat, called \"damage control\" in U.S Navy parlance, was obviously lacking. On an American warship, the crew is organized at battle stations into teams spread throughout the ship that are trained, equipped and prepared to respond to fires, flooding, loss of electrical power and other challenges. It appears the Moskva crew not only failed to blunt the incoming attack but could not control the combination of fires and flooding that followed.\n\nThe loss of Moskva is a gut punch to the Russian military and the Kremlin. First is the symbolic blow: The ship is named for Russia's capital -- think about the hit to morale and prestige you'd have if the U.S. lost the aircraft carrier George Washington.\n\nThe Moskva was also a capable command-and-control node to direct the rest of the Black Sea Fleet, which was thought to have been preparing for an attack or amphibious assault around the critical Ukrainian seaport of Odesa. Finally, its long-range cruise missiles were knocked out of action.\n\nWhile the loss of a single ship is not in itself catastrophic, it is a considerable setback, especially given the warning signal it sends to other Russian surface combatants. Having now lost two significant warships (a tank landing ship was destroyed in port several weeks ago), the Russian navy will be doubly cautious in approaching the Ukrainian seacoast.\n\nFinally, the sinking will have an effect on global operations of all navies. It is a stark reminder of the vulnerability of surface ships -- including aircraft carriers, the heart of the U.S. Navy -- to relatively low-cost, numerous and technologically advanced cruise missiles. As the Ukrainians have demonstrated by striking tanks, armored personnel carriers and helicopters ashore, the cost-benefit of a cruise missile kill is very high for the attacking force.\n\nBoth the U.K. and Argentina learned a lesson about ships' defensive flaws in the Falklands -- the British lost two destroyers and the Argentines fared worse. But for the two decades of the so-called forever wars, Western navies operated with impunity, projecting power ashore at will because Afghans, Iraqis and Syrians did not have Neptune-style cruise missiles. That won't be the case in great-power conflict.\n\nThe death of the Moskva is a vivid reminder of the need for capable anti-air weapons systems, well-honed damage control and tactical choices when operating near hostile coasts. Even as Russia seeks to learn the lessons of the sinking of its Black Sea flagship, the U.S. and its powerful allies need to as well.", "source": {"uri": "bloomberg.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bloomberg Business"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_stavridis@bloomberg.com", "name": "James Stavridis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iIyChnKQ1lHc/iYQlfYw8WaPQ/v1/1200x798.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7644527", "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 17, "stanza_neu": 19, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 38, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7008525075", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-18", "time": "22:27:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-18T22:27:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-18T22:26:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4862745106220245, "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russias-story-moskva-flagship-sunk-26740689", "title": "Russia's story that Moskva was sunk by fire exposed as lies by sailors' parents", "body": "The cruiser sank on Thursday after a blaze and an explosion Ukraine has claimed was caused by one of their missiles (Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nRussia's insistence that their prized Black Sea flagship Moskva was sunk by a fire and not by Ukrainian missiles has been exposed as a lie by mums and dads of sailors on board.\n\nThey made harrowing phone calls home to reveal the full horror of being hit by missiles.\n\nOne mother said: \"My son said that the cruiser was hit from the land, on the Ukrainian side.

Only information that has been filtered through the state media is allowable for Russian public consumption. Social media sources outside Russia have also been shut down and very little real information is getting into Russia. This makes it difficult for anyone in the country to find ground truth.\n\nThe Moskva\n\nJust one recent example is the sinking of the Moskva this past week. According to Russia's Defense Ministry, a fire of unknown origin detonated the ship's stored ammunition and resulted in an explosion that left the Moskva with structural damage. Later, the Ministry said the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet had sunk amid rough seas as it was being towed to a nearby port.\n\nUkraine says it hit the Moskva with anti-ship cruise missiles that severely damaged the ship, this past Thursday. Regardless, the ship now lies at the bottom of the Black Sea. Whether the Moskva was the victim of a Ukrainian missiles or Russian incompetence, it is an embarrassment for the Kremlin.\n\nTo control Russian public opinion, President Putin's propaganda machine was moving quickly by Friday. Russia-1, a state-owned Russian television channel and the Kremlin's mouthpiece, has championed the war since the beginning. They came close to acknowledging Ukraine sunk the Moskva by demanding a crushing response. Olga Skabeyeva, a Putin lead propagandist, told Russian-1 that Western support for Ukraine amounted to direct conflict with Russia, saying ''What it's escalated into, can safely be called World War Three.\" and \"Now we're definitely fighting against NATO infrastructure, if not NATO itself. We [Russians] need to recognize that.\"\n\nAnother guest on the show likened the sinking of the Moskva to an attack on Russian soil, despite the Kremlin's insistence it went down because of a fire. The guest had to be reminded not to use the word 'war' and to use the approved terminology 'special military operation' all the while stating Kyiv should be destroyed. Later that evening, Kyiv was struck by rockets, a clear indicator that Vladimir Putin wants revenge for the sinking of the guided missile cruiser.\n\nRussian Propaganda in the United States\n\nAs of last week, the Russian propaganda machine continues to run unfettered in the U.S. A radio station sponsored by Russian state media and hosted by Americans is spreading propaganda in two US cities. In downtown Washington DC, radio to 105.5 FM WZHF, Radio Sputnik is broadcasting Russian propaganda with American hosts. Kansas City is also broadcasting the network, even as Facebook and YouTube have been forced to stop broadcasting in Russia. RT.com and Sputniknews.com are both available with Russian state-sponsored twist to the news.\n\nScottie Nell Hughes, an American journalist, news anchor and political commentator is a presenter on Sputnik. When asked about Russian state media putting out lies about the conflict and why should the U.S. tolerate having Russian state media on our air waves, Scottie says- \"Let the American people make that decision. Trust the American people to hear what they're saying and make a decision for themselves whether or not they believe that is the truth happening.\"\n\nIt appears that it is not the job of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to sensor content, the commissioner Geoffrey Stark recently stated.

The caption in the photo-op, posted on social media by the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force, was relatively benign, simply stating that \"ADM YAMAMURA Hiroshi, Chief of Maritime staff, invited officially ADM Nikolay Yevmenov, commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy. They discussed about the current situation and the Japan-Russia defense exchange, promoted mutual understanding.\"\n\nThe photo op was, however, more interesting. It was done in front of a peculiar portrait, one of Marshal-Admiral Togo Heihachiro, the legendary Japanese admiral who destroyed Russian fleets twice in battle and sunk and captured thirteen of the Imperial Russian battleships between 1904 and 1905. The second battle was near Tsushima, one of the fiercest Russian naval defeats in history, that relegated the Russian Navy to second-tier status, from which it only recovered after World War II. This would qualitatively be similar to a British and French admiral meeting under a portrait of Horatio Nelson, or a British and German admiral meeting under one of J C Tovey, or a Japanese admiral invited in the United States to dine under a statue of William Halsey Jr. or Chester W. Nimitz.\n\nFor no fault of his own, Yevmenov had been living under the shadows of Tsushima like all Russian admirals before him -- until last week. Last Thursday, the Russian flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, Moskva, sank under mysterious circumstances after an alleged attack by Ukrainian coastal missile batteries and a subsequent explosion. As Yevmenov is still the Russian naval commander in chief, his name will now forever be associated alongside Admirals Zinovy Rozhestvensky and Nikolai Nebogatov, the officers who led to the destruction of the tsar's fleet in the battle of Tsushima.\n\nThe sinking of the mighty Moskva is a milestone in naval warfare. It is the first loss of a Russian flagship since the battle of Tsushima in 1905. It is the biggest loss of a Russian warship in enemy fire since World War II. It's the first loss of a Russian capital ship since losing of Marat due to German fire. It is currently the biggest capital ship lost post-World War II in anger since the losses of Belgrano and Sheffield during the Falklands War. It is a big setback for Russia and a major loss of prestige as losing the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet from an adversary with essentially no navy of its own. Words cannot explain how historic this is.\n\nThe loss of Moskva also means, among other historic things, one of the top threats to U.S. aircraft carriers just went away. Russian Slava-class ships (of which two are left, in Russia's Northern and Pacific fleets) are designed to attack carrier strike group escorts, as independent capital ships, sort of like Scharnhorst or Gneisenau during World War II. Moskva, a ship designed solely to kill carriers, now sunk by stray missiles in a localized war, its unused armaments lost. One can imagine the despair the Russian high command is now facing. What an absolute waste of an asset, that is determined by Forbes to be around $750 million.\n\nThe news of Moskva's sinking was a matter of febrile social media speculation until official Russian state media confirmed it. After all, the Snake Island story was half true, and the earlier news of the sinking of the Russian patrol boat Bykov turned out to be fake. It is not prudent to trust news coming out of either Ukraine or Russia, especially during the fog of war. But the confirmation of Moskva's sinking leads us to more questions than answers. After all, she had three layers of air defenses. Why was she not able to detect and stop a couple of puny Neptunes? Why was she so close to the coast, when the Russian intelligence wasn't sure if Ukrainians are still operating functional coastal batteries? Was she following a predictable pattern? Moskva had close in air defenses that could quite literally create a wall of flak.\n\nAccording to an unmanned Western official,\n\nOne of its key roles was to provide the command and control function across those vessels operating in the Black Sea ... they ought to have sufficient capability to continue to provide air defence [to] their maritime forces.\n\nDoes that mean her upgrades were not done properly? In that case, is this symbolic of all Russian military upgrades? Put simply, was it incompetence, i.e., an individual human error, or structural problems, i.e., organizational errors due to either corruption or a sign of something far more systemic, that led to Russia losing a capital ship?\n\nThese questions have serious implications for future Anglo-American naval strategy. After all, in the age of contested multipolarity, most of the future battlefields are going to be, as ever, in the high seas. The fate of a tired old giant like Moskva, facing missiles from coastal defenses and sinking while trying to provide air-defense cover to her flotilla -- work beneath her station, far from what she was meant to do -- would pale in comparison to the absolute carnage that awaits both Chinese and Western capital ships in the Indo-Pacific.", "source": {"uri": "nationalinterest.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National Interest"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/moskva.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7644527", "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 14, "stanza_neu": 25, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 40, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 2, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7010720942", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-20", "time": "12:35:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-20T12:35:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-20T12:35:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4470588266849518, "url": "https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3462607-motuzianyk-russia-taking-revenge-on-ukraine-for-destruction-of-moskva-cruiser.html", "title": "Motuzianyk: Russia taking revenge on Ukraine for destruction of Moskva cruiser ", "body": "The loss of Moskva cruiser caused resentment among Russian society.

One of them is the mother of an enlisted sailor.\n\nThe woman said that on the evening of April 14, her son called her, and everything he reported was contrary to the official statements of the Russian authorities. In particular, he confirmed that Ukrainian Neptun missiles had hit the ship. He reported about 40 dead on the cruiser. According to the sailor's mother, this ship from February 24 had already carried out a number of combat missions, including on Zmiiniy Island, and during the last campaign the Russian troops were planning an operation to land marines in Odessa. Editors are not naming her for security reasons.\n\nSailor contacted his mother on April 14.\n\n\"My son called me on the phone on the 14th in tears and said: \"Mom, do you understand what happened? Three missiles were launched at us! (according to the Ukrainian authorities, two Neptun cruise missiles were fired at the \"Moskva\" cruiser,\" the woman continued the story. - Some of the guys were evacuated to the \"Makarov\" frigate. All survivors were taken to Sevastopol. They were given telephones, because they were, excuse me, only in their underpants and blouses. They left everything, phones and documents. They were without everything.\n\nAt that moment, the woman had already seen news reports about the \"ship fire\" and asked him about it.\n\n\"He said to me: \"No, Mom, that's not true. There's no fire.\" He doesn't just say it, he didn't take it from his head. He tells me, and he cries from the horror he's been through. Well, you gotta admit, he wouldn't just make it up. And it's not a wooden dinghy that would just burst into flames. No one is explaining anything. I just don't understand why the radars on this famous cruiser that was equipped didn't recognize those Neptune missiles.\n\nTherefore, the woman now excludes the official version of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation about the alleged fire of the \"Moskva\" as a result of a munition detonation\".\n\nAccording to the mother of the Russian sailor, there were 510 people on the \"Moskva\". Her son told her he knew of 40 dead. \"He said that everyone who was on deck, in the cabin, who was in charge of the cruiser, who was on watch, died, because the impact occurred right on the deck ... There are wounded with severed limbs,\" the woman said.\n\nThe sailor's mother said that her son served on the ship as an conscript. As it turned out, from the first days of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"He was an enlisted man. And how he got on the cruiser on a mission is a big question. The cruiser was involved in combat operations, Zmeiniy Island, Odessa region. And my son was there as an enlisted man. What does that mean? Non-compliance with orders?\" Non-observance of laws?\" - says the sailor's mother.", "source": {"uri": "censor.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0437\u043e\u0440.\u041d\u0415\u0422"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://storage1b.censor.net/images/7/1/2/8/7128ad7567117a425cb6223351f40942/censor_social.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7644527", "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 37, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 41, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7010982222", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-04-20", "time": "16:07:00", "dateTime": "2022-04-20T16:07:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-04-20T16:07:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4156862795352936, "url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/04/20/the-victims-of-russias-sunken-moskva-cruiser-a77425", "title": "In Photos: the Victims of Russia's Sunken Moskva Cruiser", "body": "Now is the time to support independent reporting from Russia!
