In just one night, we counted 25 attacks, including 3 from strategic bombers. Tanks, mortars, and snipers are working; infantry is trying to storm.\n\nOver three past days, civilians were evacuated. Was everyone evacuated? We can't say because we don't have special equipment to clean the rubbles.\n\nThere are many civilian and military casualties on the territory of the plant. Two days ago, three of our service members were killed: one died when an anti-tank missile system hit a car that was supposed to evacuate civilians, and two others died while dropping bombs from a drone. Six other service members were injured. This is the price of evacuating civilians from the factory.\n\nHere we are standing up not for words, we are defending the people of Ukraine. We are performing our military duty, we do not need praise. We will fight as long as we live, for justice, for the evacuation of civilians and wounded soldiers.\n\nNumber of civilians and service members at the plant\n\nIllia Samoilenko: [As for service members, ed.] this is a very sensitive question. I can't endanger my unit.\n\nBlockade of Mariupol\n\nIllia Samoilenko: The siege of Mariupol has been going on for the last 2.5 months. It lasted so long, that never happened before in history, with so many casualties among enemy personnel and significant losses among the civilian population. What breaks my heart the most is the evacuation of small groups. Politicians note small victories like the evacuation of dozens and hundreds of people, but at the same time, the Russian army killed more than 25,000 people.\n\nOn heroism\n\nIllia Samoilenko: The truth is that we are unique. Nobody expected us to withstand for so long. Many people say that we are heroes. Many call us heroes. We do our job.\n\nHeroism comes when planning and organization fail. Many people believe that we are living heroes. When the city's siege began, we decided to stand here under any conditions and defend it.\n\nWe had an order to defend Mariupol. But we did not have an order to take full command of the defense of Mariupol, but this decision was made because no one else was able to do it. Nobody expected us to withstand that long. I did not expect either. We thought that Russia would overcome everyone, but the Armed Forces of Ukraine resisted.\n\nEnemy losses\n\nIllia Samoilenko: Ukrainian fighters from Azov Regiment killed 2,500 Russian service members in Mariupol and injured 5,000, which is more than 15% of the military losses of their army [in the battle of Mariupol, ed.].\n\nWe also destroyed more than 60 tanks and damaged another 30, which is 10% of their losses. We also destroyed 10% of the enemy artillery systems.\n\nThere were days when more than 150 air bombs were dropped on Mariupol. And we got zero support: no air support, no ground support, no artillery support. We were abandoned to the mercy of fate.\n\nCivilians at Azovstal\n\nIllia Samoilenko: There were several thousand civilians inside the plant. People fled the city and found shelter at the plant. Civilians are a limiting factor for the military. If there were no civilians, the city would be just a battlefield. But we defended them because it is our duty. We placed them in bunkers away from our positions. We provided them with medical care, food, and water and shared all our resources.\n\nAccusations of using civilians as a 'human shield'\n\nIllia Samoilenko: All these accusations are normal if you think like a Russian soldier. But if you look from the point of view of a civilian who witnessed all the horrors the Russian army did, you will understand they found refuge here behind our line of defense, inside the Azovstal plant. Many people stayed in Mariupol while we kept the line of defense outside the city.\n\nChances for surviving in Mariupol\n\nThe first option: you can put down your weapons and wait for the end. It will be a slow death from starvation or a fast one from bombs.\n\nThe second option: you can try to escape like a coward. Think only of your own life, not of duty and oath. This is exactly what happened to the commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade [Colonel Volodymyr Baranyuk is now held captive by Russian occupiers, ed.]: he refused to obey the order, and he tried to escape from the city with a small group of tanks and armored vehicles. This option could lead to death -- one person [from the brigade, ed.] died.\n\nThe third option: you can surrender. The fourth option: the only way you will not be ashamed of and which guarantees your life is to withstand and fight.\n\nOption to surrender\n\nIllia Samoilenko: All this time, we knew that the Azov Regiment had no high chance of survival if Russian troops took us prisoners; surrendering is unacceptable for us. We cannot make such a gift to the enemy. Everyone who is a prisoner is a resource of political and military pressure to increase the level of negotiations and positions that we can leave on the political scene.\n\nOne of our soldiers was captured during the battle on the twentieth of April. He was unconscious. Russian propaganda then published a video of Ukrainian soldiers surrendering their weapons, and his mother was later informed of his death.\n\nWe have several captured Russian soldiers. We exchanged them later.\n\nEvacuation of service members\n\nIllia Samoilenko: The only option for us is evacuation because we have already spent all our resources that allowed an effective defense. We still have provisions, water and weapons, including artillery, but we can't use it because we are close to the city. But all our resources are limited, they haven't been renewed. We will fight until a better solution to the situation is discovered.\n\nEvacuation of wounded service members and medics\n\nEarlier, Zelensky announced preparations for the evacuation of wounded service members and medics.\n\nIllia Samoilenko: If politicians can guarantee their security, that's good. Medics are exhausted. They are heroes, they did impossible things. If medics are evacuated from the plant, the military will be restricted in receiving medical care.\n\nCommunication with the command and families\n\nIllia Samoilenko: We have a connection with the command and an order to keep the defense.\n\nMost of us have connections with our families. We admire their support and love them very much, they show their love to us. We will meet with our families, wives, and friends one day and celebrate the victory, but we still have to fight for our victory.\n\nWho can help Mariupol\n\nIllia Samoilenko: Many petitions and statements calling for our salvation emerged due to wide international publicity. Many people want to help, but they don't know how. Any country could intervene, except Russia and those that support Russia. Any country that has enough courage to intervene and stop Russia would be good for us.\n\nAbout fear\n\nIllia Samoilenko: We have no fear. It vanished. Every day, every minute can be the last, so there is no fear. It isn't so difficult to live without fear.\n\nAbout the wounded people\n\nIllia Samoilenko: We have several hundred wounded people. We have many wounded people whom we cannot leave here, they deserve proper support and treatment. We won't leave anyone. We are providing the necessary assistance, but we have many wounded service members who need to be evacuated.\n\nLatest updates on the situation at Azovstal\n\nRussian troops broke into Azovstal in besieged Mariupol on May 4, despite Russia's claims that it had been decided to lay siege to the plant instead of storming it. Heavy fighting continues between Ukrainian forces and Russian invaders.\n\nAt that time, Ukraine and Russia, with the support of the United Nations, agreed to evacuate civilians hiding in the plant's bomb shelters. The evacuation began on May 1. On May 7, Ukrainian authorities announced that all women, children, and the elderly had been evacuated from Azovstal.\n\nPresident Zelensky announced preparations for the next step -- evacuating the wounded and medics from Azovstal. On April 27, Acting Commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade Serhiy Volynskyi said that more than 600 wounded servicemen were at the plant.\n\nDefenders of Mariupol have repeatedly appealed to the Ukrainian authorities and the world community, emphasizing that the fighters have problems with supplies of food, water, medicine, and ammunition.\n\nActivists and many non-governmental organizations created a petition to the United Nations and world leaders to rescue Ukrainian soldiers and civilians from the Azovstal plant using the extraction procedure.", "source": {"uri": "en.hromadske.ua", "dataType": "news", "title": "en.hromadske.ua"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/hromadske-en/posts/image_socials/000/003/667/original/data?1652018878", "eventUri": "eng-7697627", "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 27, "stanza_neu": 93, "stanza_pos": 6, "swn_neg": 126, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7032940650", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-08", "time": "15:34:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-08T15:34:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-08T15:04:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/surrender-is-not-an-option-azov-battalion-commander-in-plea-for-help-to-escape-mariupol", "title": "'Surrender is not an option': Azov battalion commander in plea for help to escape Mariupol", "body": "Two thousand Ukrainian troops thought to be trapped inside steelworks after civilian evacuation\n\nMembers of Ukraine's Azov battalion trapped inside Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant have said they fear they will be executed if captured by Russian forces, as they pleaded with Ukrainian authorities to help arrange their extraction.\n\nSpeaking to the media from inside the besieged steelworks, an Azov commander and lieutenant, looking gaunt and pale, said they had defended the city for the people of Ukraine and the rest of the world and needed a third party to negotiate their exit whether by land or sea.\n\nThere are believed to be 2,000 soldiers in the plant, 700 of whom are said to be injured.\n\nLieut Illya Samoilenko vowed to fight on, saying his comrades understood they would be executed if captured and that surrender would be a \"gift\" to the enemy.\n\n\"We are witnesses of Russian crimes,\" Samoilenko said. \"Surrender is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives.\"\n\nAll the civilians who were inside the plant have been evacuated, according to Azov's commander, Denys Prokopenko.\n\n\"We need the proper opportunity to be evacuated,\" Svyatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment. \"Another thing that hurts is that the politicians said you continue (fighting) while we evacuate the civilians. But we (are) here defending the people.\"\n\nThey criticised the Ukrainian government for celebrating the evacuation of several dozen civilians over the past few weeks, while failing to prepare Ukraine over the past eight years for what they say was an inevitable war with Russia.\n\n\"The government let this happen to 25,000 people,\" said Samoilenko, speaking of the number of civilians in Mariupol that he estimates have died.\n\nAzov forces say they are more than 100km from the nearest Ukrainian forces and cannot make it to safety without help from Ukraine's authorities.\n\nThe Azov battalion has been central to Russia's justification for invading Ukraine. Russia claims its members are neo-Nazis who are responsible for \"Nazifying\" Ukraine.\n\nAzov fighters say its membership holds a range of political opinions. Azov formed as a volunteer battalion in 2014 to fight Russian-backed forces and some its leaders are known to hold far-right views. But since 2015, it has been part of the Ukrainian army and no longer attracts only far-right combatants.\n\nRussian propaganda has long exaggerated the domestic influence of Azov in Ukraine as well as the scale of its membership.\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has worked to transform the image of the fighters in the eyes internationally and in Ukraine. Many now view them as heroes.\n\nSamoilenko said they felt supported by words but asked for aerial attacks on Russian positions and berated the Ukrainian authorities for not defending Ukraine's southern regions.\n\n\"We are doing our job and we are doing our job well. Some of the politicians are not doing their job well,\" said Samoilenko, who also said Azov had killed 2,500 Russian soldiers from 24 February to 25 April.\n\nSamoilenko said the weak reaction of the world to Russian aggression in 2014 is one of the reasons why this invasion had happened. He said western countries should have understood that the price of prosperity in Europe had been 15,000 Ukrainian lives in the last eight years, referring to the 2014-22 war.\n\nHe said the west had refused to help the battalion over the last eight years. Some of those who led Azov in its inception as a volunteer battalion in 2014 were of far-right leanings. The battalion was incorporated into Ukraine's army in 2015 and its members are now politically pluralistic.\n\n\"We showed that anything is possible,\" said Samoilenko. \"Please do your job and so we can teach people how to do impossible things.\"\n\nSamoilenko also criticised the Ukrainian government for negotiating with Russia, describing them as \"barbarians\". He said Azov's goal was to eliminate the enemy threat by pacifying Russia and that they were not only fighting for Ukraine but the whole of the free world.\n\nSamoilenko declined to say how many soldiers were left in the plant or talk about their supplies, saying that this was classified operational information. The fighters say morale is still high, despite coming under almost constant shelling.\n\n\"We're grateful for the support from the world and this might help,\" said Samoilenko \"People have seen who we are.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isobel_koshiw@theguardian.com", "name": "Isobel Koshiw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/662ea679c644aee27696f28ab1fd877a3eb1c6ff/0_277_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=feb9547d223f1d87297cd1b40f5dd339", "eventUri": "eng-7697627", "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 25, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 37, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7035940191", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-10", "time": "23:06:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-10T23:06:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-10T22:08:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "url": "https://www.today.com/parents/parents/photos-wounded-ukrainian-soldiers-mariupol-steel-plant-rcna28137", "title": "Harrowing photos offer rare glimpse of wounded soldiers in besieged Mariupol steel plant", "body": "Photos of badly wounded Ukrainian soldiers trapped in a steel plant in Mariupol give a rare look at the conditions of those fighting Russia's ongoing attempts to take control of the city.\n\nLt.

According to Prokopenko, this would have changed the trajectory of the fight for Mariupol.\n\nSource: Denys Prokopenko, interview with Ukrainska Pravda\n\nQuote from Prokopenko: \"If the forces located there [at the Crimea-Ukraine border] held the defence firmer, did everything they could to resist the enemy's advance, didn't just let the enemy troops enter the [Ukrainian] cities, everything would have been different now.\n\nThe thing is, the enemy should have been destroyed at the neck of land connecting Crimea with the rest of Ukraine, near Henichesk. The enemy's manoeuvring capacity would have been limited there and would only have had one way to advance. Given the terrain, the enemy would have been bottlenecked.\n\nFrom the tactical point of view, that was the location that would have been the most conducive to inflicting damage on the enemy troops, in order to hinder their advance and destroy them. The enemy troops should have been destroyed there, during their advance from Crimea. And for some reason, this just wasn't done.\"\n\nDetails: Prokopenko believes that the siege of Mariupol could have been avoided.\n\nQuote from Prokopenko: \"If Henichesk, Melitopol, and Berdiansk, and other cities [on the Russians' route from Crimea to Mariupol] held their defence and fought the enemy as steadfastly [as Mariupol's defenders], it would have taken the enemy much longer than 4 days to get from Crimea to Mariupol.\n\nSince this is not how it happened, we found ourselves surrounded. Because in reality the enemy covered quite a substantial distance without meeting much resistance. Russian troops marched from Crimea without any significant fights on their way and found themselves on the western outskirts of Mariupol.\"\n\nMore details: The Azov Regiment Commander also said that the actions of the 36th Marine Brigade \"are difficult to make sense of.\"\n\n\"First, 1 battalion surrendered, as early as 4 April. As a result, we lost the only connection we had between Azov and the 36th Brigade. Then unexpectedly the commander of the 36th Brigade decided, without warning anyone, to just break through in a direction that wasn't agreed ahead of time, and that's how he lost lots of his people. Likewise, many people were just left to their own devices and ended up as Russian prisoners...These uncoordinated actions suddenly undertaken by the 36th Brigade had catastrophic consequences, which we can no longer reverse,\" Prokopenko noted.\n\nProkopenko added that nearly 1,000 Marines ended up as Russian prisoners of war.\n\nEarlier: On 8 May, Illia Samoilenko, an intelligence officer, said that Volodymyr Baraniuk, commander of the 36th Marine Brigade, decided to flee the besieged Mariupol with his personnel, tanks, and ammunition.", "source": {"uri": "news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5Pvb4fa1r9iJi3JDx2CqHA--~B/aD0zODc7dz02OTA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ukrayinska_pravda_articles_451/f0be41c998ab2a200742b05cd07d4123", "eventUri": "eng-7697627", "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 6, "stanza_neu": 17, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 23, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7032925243", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-08", "time": "15:14:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-08T15:14:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-08T15:14:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "url": "https://censor.net/en/news/3339941/regiment_azov_destroyed_in_mariupol_25_thousand_russian_occupiers_officer_of_management_of_intelligence", "title": "Regiment \"Azov\" destroyed in Mariupol 2,5 thousand Russian occupiers, - officer of management of intelligence Samoilenko", "body": "Fighters of the Azov Regiment killed 2,500 Russian occupiers in Mariupol and wounded another 5,000, as well as destroyed about 60 tanks of the enemy's army.\n\nIlya Samoilenko, an officer of the intelligence department and a fighter of the Azov Regiment, stated this at a press conference, Censor.NET reports.\n\nAccording to my own estimates and the estimates of the units, we killed almost 2,500 personnel (of the Russian army) and wounded more than 5,000.

The fighters -- who include men and women -- are holding out in a labyrinth of shelters under the Soviet-era Azovstal plant, one of the largest steel mills in Europe. On Sunday, the soldiers even managed to hold a video press conference from inside the plant, despite problems with connectivity. They call the tunnels \"the territory of Azovstal\" but paint a dire picture of what's happening there. They say there are many dead, and more wounded.\n\nSviatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov Regiment, told reporters that wounded soldiers are dying from gangrene due to infections because there aren't enough antibiotics and no equipment to conduct amputations.\n\n\"It is truly catastrophic,\" Palamar said.\n\nUkrainian and Russian officials say all civilians have been evacuated from Azovstal after three operations led by the United Nations and International Committee of the Red Cross. (U.N. humanitarian officials say they can't independently confirm this.) But the soldiers remain to fight what Ivantsova compares to a modern-day Battle of Thermopylae.\n\n\"I've heard people call our soldiers 'the 300,' 'the Spartans,'\" she tells NPR at the Zaporizhzhia hotel where she and others demonstrated. \"I have mixed feelings. I am proud of them, but right now we don't need dead heroes. We need living heroes.\"\n\nIvantsova met her husband 30 years ago, when he was a young soldier and she was a college freshman. He's Ukrainian. She was born in Chita, a city in Russia's far east.\n\n\"I feel ashamed to admit that I was born in Russia,\" she says, sighing. \"I don't want to be associated with this country. Look what [the Russians] have done to Mariupol. I don't even talk to my relatives there.\"\n\nThe couple have four children and four grandchildren. They used to live in Mariupol. Her husband helped defend the city when Russian-backed separatists attacked in 2015. And when Russian troops invaded this February, he fought alongside hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers to defend the city. Russian troops pummeled Mariupol, reducing most of it to charred rubble. Mariupol's vice mayor, Sergei Orlov, tells NPR that thousands of residents are estimated to have died during the Russian siege. Many are thought to be buried in mass graves. Russian troops now occupy the ruins of the city.\n\n\"Azovstal is the last part of Mariupol that is free,\" Ivantsova says. \"Our soldiers should be rewarded for this.\"\n\nShe says her husband tells her he wants to fight to the last bullet. And she understands that, as a soldier, he signed up for this life. But she worries that if he and his fellow soldiers are captured, they will be executed.\n\n\"Nobody trusts the army of Vladimir Putin,\" she says, referring to Russia's president. \"He can barely honor a cease-fire.\"\n\nRussia has also sought to portray the Azovstal soldiers as far-right extremists. Some of the soldiers holed up in the steel plant are members of the Azov Regiment, which is a unit of the Ukrainian National Guard. It got its start as a volunteer battalion, founded in 2014 by far-right nationalists. But many of these extremists left after the battalion joined the armed forces, says Polina Beliakova, a research associate at the Center for Strategic Studies at Tufts University who has studied Ukraine's volunteer battalions. She says the Azov Regiment currently includes fighters with diverse political views and ethnic backgrounds.\n\nIvantsova says her husband rejects far-right views and only wants to defend Ukraine.\n\n\"Nikolai is a patriot,\" she says. \"And by that I mean he wants everyone in this country to live and breathe free.\"\n\nOutside the hotel with the U.N. vans, at least a dozen women join Ivantsova in singing the national anthem. Their handwritten posters rattle in the wind. A few reporters show up but no one else stops.\n\nLater, the group meets at the EpiCenter, a shopping mall that features a large DIY home improvement store. The parking lot has become a way station for displaced Ukrainians fleeing Russian attacks. The centerpiece is a large tent stuffed with clothes, stuffed animals, plastic bags of nonperishable food and a station for coffee, tea and hot soup. Humanitarian workers are everywhere.\n\n\"Let's take out the signs,\" Ivantsova says.\n\nThe news from Azovstal seems to get more dire every hour. Russian troops began storming the underground tunnels. There are reports that the fighting is bloody and fierce. Some of the men have also sent goodbye messages to their spouses.\n\nA 22-year-old, her brown hair in a long braid, weeps. She gives her name as Olha and won't reveal her last name because she's worried the Russians will target her fianc\u00e9, who is inside Azovstal, if they capture him. She describes him as soft-spoken and romantic, the kind of guy who used to make her coffee every morning and slip Kinder chocolates (her favorite) into her handbag.\n\n\"Even when he's in a living hell -- which is where he is right now -- he always asks me how I'm doing, if I need help, if he can do anything for me,\" she says. \"And he writes very tender poems for me.\"\n\nShe's one of the few who speak to NPR at the shopping center parking lot. Many of the women are wiping away tears and waving away reporters. They flag down a Greek Catholic priest and ask him if he has connections to the Vatican. Some of the women have sent a letter to Pope Francis asking for help. The priest asks them to pray.\n\nAnother military spouse, who gives only her first name, Katia, gets angry.\n\n\"We don't need prayer, we need action,\" she says. \"How could the government and all these international aid organizations leave Ukraine's heroes -- our husbands -- in there to die?\"\n\nYaroslava Ivantsova's husband hasn't been online for two days.\n\n\"There is no mobile communication, I asked the girls but absolutely no one has communication,\" she says. \"I am so worried.\" She digs into her purse. \"I even tried to find my anti-anxiety pills. I had them somewhere.\"\n\nAs she looks, the other women begin chanting: Save Azovstal! Ivantsova drops her bag to the ground and clutches a handwritten banner that reads: \"Save Us.\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joanna_kakissis@npr.org", "name": "Joanna Kakissis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2022/05/10/gettyimages-1240448228_wide-c855bb40a26760184a0d5b9b20ffed795b24f1cf.jpg?s=1400", "eventUri": "eng-7697627", "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 67, "stanza_pos": 4, "swn_neg": 84, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}]
