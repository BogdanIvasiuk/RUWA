They include issues such as where they can be held; the relief they should receive, including medical help for wounded ex-fighters; and legal proceedings they might face.\n\n\"In this case, the Russian Federation has an entire list of obligations: To treat them humanely, to let the ICRC (have) access to them, to inform the ICRC of their names, to allow them to write to their families, to care for them if they are wounded and sick, to feed them and so on,\" said Marco Sassoli, a professor of international law at the University of Geneva.\n\n\"But obviously, the detaining power may deprive them of their liberty until the end of the international armed conflict and may hold them - unlike civilians - on their own territories. So they may be brought to Russia,\" he said.\n\nOnly under certain conditions, notably if an individual fighter is accused of committing one or more war crimes. Such an accusation must be based on published evidence, Sassoli said.\n\n\"They can certainly not be punished for having participated in the hostilities, because that's the privilege of combatants and of prisoners of war,\" he said.\n\nThe Geneva Conventions do not set rules for prisoner exchanges. In the past, Red Cross intermediaries have helped carry out agreed-upon POW exchanges. Still, much has been made of the insistence by some Russian officials that detained Ukrainian ex-fighters should face trial and should not be included in any prisoner exchanges.\n\nSome countries have tried to sidestep their Geneva Conventions obligations - or simply argue that they are not bound by them. A prominent case was when the US detained hundreds of fighters allegedly linked to groups like al-Qaeda. They were detained as \"enemy combatants\" at a US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after the September 11 attacks and the subsequent US-led military invasion to topple the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan.\n\nSassoli said there are \"all kinds of reasons\" why an individual might lose their prisoner of war status. For example, if the fighter \"didn't distinguish themselves from the civilian population\" during combat.\n\n\"But here, to the best of my knowledge, no one claims that these people [detainees from the Azov Regiment in Mariupol] didn't wear a uniform, or if they don't belong to the Ukrainian armed forces,\" Sassoli said.\n\n\"It's basically Ukraine who decides who belongs to their armed forces.\"\n\nUkrainian leaders have repeatedly touted the regiment's role in the armed forces and have celebrated what they call its members' \"heroism\" for holding out so long against far-larger Russian forces.\n\nUkraine and Russia have both accepted an important annex to the Geneva Conventions that broadens the definition of what fighters - militia or otherwise - might be considered as part of the national military force, based in part on whether they follow military commands. As for the Azov Regiment fighters, \"there's no doubt\" they are part of Ukraine's military force, said Sassoli, who was on a three-person team commissioned by the Organisation for Security Cooperation in Europe that travelled to Ukraine in March.\n\nHowever, Russia has not been fully clear about who is detaining the former Azovstal fighters - Russia itself, or the breakaway pro-Russian areas in Ukraine such as the so-called \"Donetsk People's Republic\" or the \"Luhansk People's Republic,\" which could blur such distinctions.\n\nThursday's statement was the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 that the ICRC - which plays an often-confidential role to check on prisoners of war - has said anything officially about POWs in the conflict.\n\n\"Normally, the ICRC will not tell you how these people are treated, but the ICRC will say whom they visited,\" Sassoli said.\n\n\"But the ICRC - to the best of my knowledge, until this media release - did not clarify how many people it had access to, on both sides.\"\n\nBeyond its communication about the Azovstal fighters, the ICRC has not said whether it has registered other POWs or carried out any visits with POWs on either side of the war.", "source": {"uri": "globalcrisisnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global Crisis News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://globalcrisisnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-05-17T142715Z_472990216_RC219U97B0M9_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-RUSSIA-AZOVSTAL.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724228", "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 24, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 33, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7046733903", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-19", "time": "09:13:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-19T09:13:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-19T09:13:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8549019694328308, "url": "https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-crisis/icrc-claims-to-have-registered-hundreds-of-ukrainian-pows-at-azovstal-pant-in-mariupol-articleshow.html", "title": "ICRC claims to have registered hundreds of Ukrainian POWs at Azovstal pant in Mariupol", "body": "The ICRC stated in a press release that it began registering soldiers leaving the Azovstal steel plant, including the wounded on Tuesday, May 17.\n\nAs the ruthless war between Russia and Ukraine continues unabated, hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) were registered this week at the Azovstal steel pant in Mariupol by a team from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The ICRC stated in a press release that it began registering soldiers leaving the Azovstal plant, including the wounded on Tuesday, May 17. It further stated that the registration was initiated at the request of all the parties and that the ICRC is not transporting POWs to their detention centres.\n\nThe ICRC facilitated the registration process by having the individual fill out a form containing personal information such as name, date of birth, and closest relative. The press release further stated that the ICRC is authorised to use this information to track people who have been abducted and assist them in staying in touch with their families. The ICRC also must have rapid access to all POWs in all locations where they are imprisoned, according to the mandate assigned to it by States under the 1949 Geneva Conventions.\n\nAs per the release, the ICRC must be allowed to interrogate prisoners of war without the presence of witnesses, and the duration and frequency of these visits should not be limited. \"Registering POWs is an essential part of our work. Whenever circumstances permit, each party to the conflict must take all possible measures to search for and collect the dead. It's critical to ensure they are accounted for & treated humanely and with dignity,\" the ICRC said in a statement.

sent will be used to treat 65,000 patients in 13 primary health care facilities for three months, 6,600 diabetic patients for a year in four hospitals, in addition to significant support for services in operations in various hospitals.\n\nThe inhabitants of Mekele, Adigrat, Adwa, Axum and Shire could also benefit from safe drinking water thanks to the treatment and maintenance of the hydraulic installations of the cities, he added.\n\nIn addition to medical support and the contribution to the water supply, the help provided by the ICRC included essential household items for 15,000 people as well as the distribution of seeds to 20,000 farmers which will also support 20,000 patients in 19 primary health care centers for one month as well as the health professionals and their families by providing them with food.\n\nHowever, Sidler stressed that the assistance remains limited in view of the needs identified.\n\nAccording to him, the ICRC continues providing its main assistance programs without ever being interrupted in the border of Afar and Amhara regions as well as in Oromia and Somali regions.\n\nActivities of the ICRC in the field of health would also continue with the provision of emergency medical equipment for the care of the wounded in conflict situations and support for existing health structures in order to provide basic services to the community and displaced

written messages as well as other family tracing services to individuals separated by conflict, migration or disaster, in all parts of the country.\n\nDaniel further revealed that the ICRC has adopted a transversal approach, including prevention, risk reduction and care activities to deal with the conflict-related sexual violence in Ethiopia and its humanitarian consequences for survivors and the community as a whole.\n\nHe pointed out that all ICRC humanitarian aid distributions are carried out without any intermediary, directly to the people affected and are subject to strict controls,

happen to 100s of Ukrainian POWs?", "body": "By JAMEY KEATEN - Associated Press\n\nGENEVA (AP) -- Breaking its recent silence on prisoners of war, the Red Cross said Thursday it has registered \"hundreds\" of Ukrainian prisoners of war who left the giant Azovstal steel plant in the southern city of Mariupol after holding out in a weeks-long standoff with besieging Russian forces.\n\nThe announcement by the International Committee of the Red Cross, which acts as a guardian of the Geneva Conventions that aim to limit \"the barbarity of war,\" came shortly after Russia's military said 1,730 Ukrainian troops at the steel mill have surrendered.\n\nAttention now is turning to how those prisoners of war might be treated and what rights they have. Here's a look at some key questions about POWs in Russia's nearly three-month-old war on Ukraine:\n\nWHO IS A PRISONER OF WAR?\n\nArticle 4 of the third Geneva Convention, which focuses on POWs, defines them as any member of armed forces or militias -- including organized resistance movements -- in a conflict who \"who have fallen into the power of the enemy.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nIt also includes non-combatant crew members, war correspondents and even \"inhabitants of a non-occupied territory who, on the approach of the enemy, spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces.\"\n\nWHAT RIGHTS DO POWS HAVE?\n\nThe Geneva Conventions set out requirements to ensure that POWs are treated humanely. They include issues such as where they can be held; the relief they should receive, including medical help for wounded ex-fighters; and legal proceedings they might face.\n\n\"In this case, the Russian Federation has an entire list of obligations: To treat them humanely, to let the ICRC (have) access to them, to inform the ICRC of their names, to allow them to write to their families, to care for them if they are wounded and sick, to feed them and so on,\" said Marco Sassoli, a professor of international law at the University of Geneva.\n\n\"But obviously, the detaining power may deprive them of their liberty until the end of the international armed conflict and may hold them -- unlike civilians -- on their own territories. So they may be brought to Russia,\" he said.\n\nCAN THEY BE PUT ON TRIAL?\n\nOnly under certain conditions, notably if an individual fighter is accused of committing one or more war crimes. Such an accusation must be based on published evidence, Sassoli said.\n\n\"They can certainly not be punished for having participated in the hostilities, because that's the privilege of combatants and of prisoners of war,\" he said.\n\nCOULD POWS BECOME PART OF PRISONER EXCHANGES?\n\nThe Geneva Conventions do not set rules for prisoner exchanges. In the past, Red Cross intermediaries have helped carry out agreed-upon POW exchanges.\n\nStill, much has been made of the insistence by some Russian officials that detained Ukrainian ex-fighters should face trial and should not be included in any prisoner exchanges.\n\nCOULD RUSSIA CLAIM THE FIGHTERS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO POW STATUS?\n\nSome countries have tried to sidestep their Geneva Conventions obligations -- or simply argue that they're not bound by them.\n\nA prominent case was when the United States detained hundreds of fighters allegedly linked to terrorist groups like al-Qaida. They were detained as \"enemy combatants\" at a U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after the Sept. 11 attacks and the subsequent U.S.-led military operation to topple the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan.\n\nSassoli said there are \"all kinds of reasons\" why an individual might lose their prisoner of war status. For example, if the fighter \"didn't distinguish themselves from the civilian population\" during combat.\n\n\"But here, to the best of my knowledge, no one claims that these people (detainees from the Azov Regiment in Mariupol) didn't wear a uniform, or if they don't belong to the Ukrainian armed forces,\" Sassoli said. \"It's basically Ukraine who decides who belongs to their armed forces.\"\n\nUkrainian leaders have repeatedly touted the regiment's role in the armed forces and have celebrated what they call its members' heroism for holding out so long against far-larger Russian forces.\n\nTHE AZOV REGIMENT IS PART OF THE NATIONAL GUARD -- DOES THAT MATTER?\n\nUkraine and Russia have both accepted an important annex to the Geneva Conventions that broadens the definition of what fighters -- militia or otherwise -- might be considered as part of the national military force, based in part on whether they follow military commands.\n\nAs for the Azov Regiment fighters, \"there's no doubt\" they are part of Ukraine's military force, said Sassoli, who was on a three-person team commissioned by the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe that travelled to Ukraine in March.\n\nHowever, Russia hasn't been fully clear about who is detaining the former Azovstal fighters -- Russia itself, or the breakaway pro-Russian areas in Ukraine such as the so-called \"Donetsk People's Republic\" or the \"Luhansk People's Republic,\" which could blur such distinctions.\n\nWHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RED CROSS STATEMENT?\n\nThursday's statement was the first time since Russia invaded on Feb. 24 that the ICRC -- which plays an often-confidential role to check on prisoners of war -- has said anything officially about POWs in the conflict.\n\n\"Normally, the ICRC will not tell you how these people are treated, but the ICRC will say whom they visited,\" said Sassoli. \"But the ICRC -- to the best of my knowledge, until this media release -- did not clarify how many people it had access to, on both sides.\"\n\nBeyond its communication about the Azovstal fighters, the ICRC has not said whether it has registered other POWs or carried out any visits with POWs on either side of the war.\n\nFollow all AP stories on the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Ukrainian troops have offered \"stiff resistance,\" according to U.S. officials.\n\nThe Russian military has since launched a full-scale ground offensive in eastern Ukraine's disputed Donbas region, attempting to capture the strategic port city of Mariupol to secure a coastal corridor to the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula.\n\nHere's how the news is developing. All times Eastern:\n\nMay 19, 8:29 am\n\nICRC registers hundreds of prisoners of war from Mariupol steel plant\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said Thursday that it has registered hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war from a besieged steel plant in war-ravaged Mariupol this week, after the Ukrainian city fell into Russian hands.\n\nA team from the ICRC began on Tuesday to register combatants leaving the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works plant, including the wounded, at the request of the parties to the conflict. The operation continued Wednesday and was still ongoing Thursday. The ICRC is not transporting prisoners of war to the places where they are held, according to a press release from the organization.\n\n\"The registration process that the ICRC facilitated involves the individual filling out a form with personal details like name, date of birth and closest relative,\" the organization said. \"This information allows the ICRC to track those who have been captured and help them keep in touch with their families.\"\n\nThe ICRC noted that it \"maintains a confidential dialogue with the parties to the conflict on their obligations under international humanitarian law.\"\n\n\"In accordance with the mandate given to the ICRC by States under the 1949 Geneva Conventions, the ICRC must have immediate access to all POWs in all places where they are held,\" the organization added. \"The ICRC must be allowed to interview prisoners of war without witnesses, and the duration and frequency of these visits should not be unduly restricted. Whenever circumstances permit, each party to the conflict must take all possible measures to search for and collect the dead.\"\n\nFor weeks, Ukrainian fighters and civilians were holed up inside Mariupol's vast Azovstal plant as the remaining pocket of Ukrainian resistance to Russia's relentless bombardment of the strategic southeastern port city. Russia claimed Thursday that 1,730 Ukrainian fighters had surrendered in Mariupol over the previous three days, while Ukraine confirmed Tuesday that more than 250 had yielded in the initial hours after it ordered them to do so.\n\nMariupol is the largest city that Russian forces have seized since launching an invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24. Its complete capture gives Russia total control of the coast of the Sea of Azov as well as a continuous stretch of territory along eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\nMay 19, 7:30 am\n\nRussia has fired top commanders over Ukraine war failures, UK says\n\nRussia has fired senior military commanders in recent weeks \"who are considered to have performed poorly during the opening stages of its invasion of Ukraine,\" the U.K. Ministry of Defense said Thursday in an intelligence update.\n\nAccording to the ministry, Lt. Gen. Serhiy Kisel, who commanded Russia's elite 1st Guards Tank Army, has been suspended for his failure to capture Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv. Vice Adm. Igor Osipov, who commanded Russia's Black Sea Fleet, has also likely been suspended following the sinking of the fleet's flagship, Moskva, in April. Gen. Valeriy Gerasimov, the Russian military's chief of the general staff, likely remains in his post, but it was unclear whether he retains the confidence of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the ministry.\n\n\"A culture of cover-ups and scape-goating is probably prevalent within the Russian military and security system,\" the ministry said. \"Many officials involved in the invasion of Ukraine will likely be increasingly distracted by efforts to avoid personal culpability for Russia's operational set-backs.\"\n\n\"This will likely place further strain on Russia's centralised model of command and control, as officers increasingly seek to defer key decisions to their superiors,\" the ministry added. \"It will be difficult for Russia to regain the initiative under these conditions.\"\n\nMay 19, 6:30 am\n\nRussia puts two Ukrainian commanders on wanted list\n\nRussia has placed two Ukrainian commanders on a wanted list.\n\nSerhiy Velychko and Kostiantyn Nemychev, commanders of the Azov Regiment, a far-right group now part of the Ukrainian military, have been added to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs' database of wanted fugitives in connection with a criminal case.\n\nAccording to the Russian Investigative Committee, Velychko and Nemychev are accused of attempted murder of at least eight Russian servicemen who sustained multiple injuries in eastern Ukraine's Kharkiv region. Criminal charges were brought against the pair in absentia, and Russian authorities are working to track down and apprehend them.\n\nMay 18, 10:41 pm\n\nSenate confirms new US ambassador to Ukraine\n\nThe Senate on Wednesday night unanimously confirmed the new U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, a career foreign service officer.\n\nThe vote took place on the same day the U.S. officially resumed operations at its embassy in Kyiv.\n\nMay 18, 3:46 pm\n\nGoogle's Russian business to file for for bankruptcy\n\nGoogle Russia has published a notice of its intention to file for bankruptcy, a spokesperson told ABC News in a statement.\n\n\"We previously announced that we paused the vast majority of our commercial operations in Russia.

The official said it is not clear what the intent is for this line of advance, but the U.S. sees no signs of an imminent naval assault at this time.\n\nThe U.S. believes Russia is \"certainly trying\" to disrupt to flow of military aid moving through Ukraine, but there have been no indications that it has had any success, according to the official.\n\nThree of the eleven Mi-17 helicopters, more than 200 of the 300 Switchblade drones and nearly 10 Phoenix Ghost drones that the U.S. has promised Ukraine have been delivered, according to the official.

They include issues such as where they can be held; the relief they should receive, including medical help for wounded ex-fighters; and legal proceedings they might face.\n\n\"In this case, the Russian Federation has an entire list of obligations: To treat them humanely, to let the ICRC (have) access to them, to inform the ICRC of their names, to allow them to write to their families, to care for them if they are wounded and sick, to feed them and so on,\" said Marco Sassoli, a professor of international law at the University of Geneva.\n\n\"But obviously, the detaining power may deprive them of their liberty until the end of the international armed conflict and may hold them -- unlike civilians -- on their own territories. So they may be brought to Russia,\" he said.\n\nCAN THEY BE PUT ON TRIAL?\n\nOnly under certain conditions, notably if an individual fighter is accused of committing one or more war crimes. Such an accusation must be based on published evidence, Sassoli said.\n\n\"They can certainly not be punished for having participated in the hostilities, because that's the privilege of combatants and of prisoners of war,\" he said.\n\nCOULD POWS BECOME PART OF PRISONER EXCHANGES?\n\nThe Geneva Conventions do not set rules for prisoner exchanges. In the past, Red Cross intermediaries have helped carry out agreed-upon POW exchanges.\n\nStill, much has been made of the insistence by some Russian officials that detained Ukrainian ex-fighters should face trial and should not be included in any prisoner exchanges.\n\nCOULD RUSSIA CLAIM THE FIGHTERS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO POW STATUS?\n\nSome countries have tried to sidestep their Geneva Conventions obligations -- or simply argue that they're not bound by them.\n\nA prominent case was when the United States detained hundreds of fighters allegedly linked to terrorist groups like al-Qaida. They were detained as \"enemy combatants\" at a U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after the Sept. 11 attacks and the subsequent U.S.-led military operation to topple the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan.\n\nSassoli said there are \"all kinds of reasons\" why an individual might lose their prisoner of war status. For example, if the fighter \"didn't distinguish themselves from the civilian population\" during combat.\n\n\"But here, to the best of my knowledge, no one claims that these people (detainees from the Azov Regiment in Mariupol) didn't wear a uniform, or if they don't belong to the Ukrainian armed forces,\" Sassoli said. \"It's basically Ukraine who decides who belongs to their armed forces.\"\n\nUkrainian leaders have repeatedly touted the regiment's role in the armed forces and have celebrated what they call its members' heroism for holding out so long against far-larger Russian forces.\n\nTHE AZOV REGIMENT IS PART OF THE NATIONAL GUARD -- DOES THAT MATTER?\n\nUkraine and Russia have both accepted an important annex to the Geneva Conventions that broadens the definition of what fighters -- militia or otherwise -- might be considered as part of the national military force, based in part on whether they follow military commands.\n\nAs for the Azov Regiment fighters, \"there's no doubt\" they are part of Ukraine's military force, said Sassoli, who was on a three-person team commissioned by the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe that travelled to Ukraine in March.\n\nHowever, Russia hasn't been fully clear about who is detaining the former Azovstal fighters -- Russia itself, or the breakaway pro-Russian areas in Ukraine such as the so-called \"Donetsk People's Republic\" or the \"Luhansk People's Republic,\" which could blur such distinctions.\n\nWHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RED CROSS STATEMENT?\n\nThursday's statement was the first time since Russia invaded on Feb. 24 that the ICRC -- which plays an often-confidential role to check on prisoners of war -- has said anything officially about POWs in the conflict.\n\n\"Normally, the ICRC will not tell you how these people are treated, but the ICRC will say whom they visited,\" said Sassoli. \"But the ICRC -- to the best of my knowledge, until this media release -- did not clarify how many people it had access to, on both sides.\"\n\nBeyond its communication about the Azovstal fighters, the ICRC has not said whether it has registered other POWs or carried out any visits with POWs on either side of the war.\n\n___\n\nFollow all AP stories on the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c889c14/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x3078+0+285/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc5%2F86%2Fb0f4145cb93fdd7cf003ece63d4a%2Fc55d3a2692984e7c97a43e7d955008cf", "eventUri": "eng-7724228", "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 34, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 42, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7047016796", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-19", "time": "12:52:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-19T12:52:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-19T12:32:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/russia-says-771-more-ukrainian-troops-surrendered-at-mariupol-steelworks", "title": "Russia says 771 more Ukrainian troops 'surrendered' at Mariupol steelworks", "body": "Russia has said a further 771 Ukrainian troops have \"surrendered\" at Mariupol's besieged Azovstal steelworks, bringing the total number to 1,730 fighters this week, while the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it has started registering the Ukrainian prisoners of war who left the plant this week.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said that 80 soldiers who surrendered in the past day were wounded and were being treated in hospitals in the Russian-held cities of Novoazovsk and Donetsk.

The Guardian was not able to independently verify both claims.\n\nThe Azov regiment was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia to fight Russia-backed forces in east Ukraine, and many of its original members had far-right extremist views. Since then, the unit has been integrated into the Ukrainian national guard and the regiment now denies being fascist, racist or neo-Nazi. The Azov movement has been used as a key part of the Russian propaganda narrative to justify the war in Ukraine.\n\nNext week, Russia's supreme court will hear an application to designate Ukraine's Azov regiment as a \"terrorist organisation\", opening the way for sentences of up to 20 years for those convicted of involvement.\n\nExperts believe that a trial of the Ukrainian troops, described by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as \"heroes\", would further complicate efforts to resume the stalled peace negotiations.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pjotr_sauer@theguardian.com", "name": "Pjotr Sauer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38da8600f89f9df2e0f4774a04fec2b457590772/0_342_5216_3129/master/5216.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=3028c7ed76c0ab97d7a848edf17e2316", "eventUri": "eng-7724228", "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 9, "stanza_neu": 16, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 25, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7044494283", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-17", "time": "17:04:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-17T17:04:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-17T16:39:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/fg-flags-off-international-training-of-trainers-in-basic-emergency-care-services/", "title": "FG flags off International training of trainers in basic emergency care services", "body": "The Federal Government has flagged off the International Training of Trainers in Basic Emergency Care Services organised by the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC).\n\nAddressing the participants, the National Programme Manager of the National Emergency Medical Services and Ambulance System (NEMSAS), Dr Saidu Ahmed Dumbulwa, disclosed that the flag-off marks a very important day in the history of the Ministry's strong desire to promote Emergency Medical Services in Nigeria in collaboration and support of ICRC, which is in line with the World Health Organisation's (WHO) recognition as a tie of the healthcare system.\n\nDr Saidu commended the management of ICRC for packaging the Training of Trainers of the Basic Emergency Care Services (BECS), which is the first of its kind in sub-Sahara Africa to give credence to effective medical emergency response.\n\n\"As part of Mr President Health Sector Agenda, we currently have the Basic Healthcare Provision Fund (BHCPF), with three gateways, the NPHCDA, NHIS and EMT. 5% of the 1% CRF is allocated to the EMT gateway.\"\n\n\"The EMT gateway he further revealed owns a programme called National Emergency Medical Services and Ambulance System, NEMSAS.\"\n\nThe National Programme Manager, NEMSAS, noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the fragility of our health system in Nigeria and globally especially in the areas of medical response, NEMSAS, therefore, stands as a better option for addressing the missing link in the Nigeria Health Sector for effective emergency medical response in the control of outbreak of disease in Nigeria.\n\nALSO READ FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE\n\nDr Saidu on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Health thanked the ICRC and those 'who have expressed their support for the laudable idea of NEMSAS, and still seek more support of all stakeholders as \"the training will be a game-changer especially as we are preparing to roll out the pilot of the NEMSAS Programme.\"\n\nSpeaking earlier, the representative of the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC).

gas.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a news conference alongside Qatar's emir that the agreement signed Friday \"opens many opportunities for successful cooperation.\" He said that Qatar also \"has enormous potential for renewable energies and for the production of hydrogen.\"\n\nGermany plans to build two liquefied natural gas terminals to bring in gas from suppliers such as

As of now, 1,908 people have laid down arms,\" Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was quoted by the Russian media as saying Friday.\n\nOn Thursday, the Russian military put the total of surrendered fighters at 1,730. It remains unclear how many fighters are still holed up in the giant steel plant's maze of underground tunnels and bunkers.\n\nDenys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, said Friday that the defenders of Mariupol -- a group of Ukrainian fighters from various military and law enforcement units -- - have received an order to \"cease the defense of the city.\" The intention is to \"save lives and health of the servicemen of the garrison,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in a video statement released on Telegram, Prokopenko also said that \"the seriously wounded received the necessary assistance and they were able to be evacuated with further exchange and delivery to the territory controlled by Ukraine.\"\n\nIt was not clear from the video whether Prokopenko was still at the plant.

It said only that the visits had taken place \"in recent months.\"\n\nThe statement came a day after the humanitarian agency broke its silence about prisoners of war in the nearly three-month-long conflict, announcing it has registered \"hundreds\" of Ukrainian prisoners of war this week from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. It remains unclear how many fighters are still holed up in the giant steel plant's maze of underground tunnels and bunkers.\n\n\"Many more families need answers; the ICRC must have full access to POWs and civilian internees, wherever they are held, in order to provide those answers,\" the Geneva-based organization said.\n\nSome humanitarian law experts have questioned why the ICRC took so long to announce its POW visits, a key part of its mandate.\n\nThe ICRC often operates confidentially in its role to help protect civilians, prisoners of war and other noncombatants in conflicts, and ensure the respect of the rules of war.\n\nKOENIGSWINTER, Germany -- Germany's finance minister says the Group of Seven leading economies and global financial institutions are providing $19.8 billion in aid to bolster Ukraine's public finances.\n\nFinance Minister Christian Lindner told reporters Friday that $9.5 billion of the total was mobilized at meetings of the G-7 finance ministers in Koenigswinter, Germany, this week.\n\nHe said the goal is to ensure that Ukraine's financial situation does not affect its ability to defend itself against Russia's invasion.\n\n\"We agreed on concrete actions to deepen multilateral economic cooperation and underlined our commitment to our united response to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and to our unwavering support to Ukraine,\" a G-7 statement said.\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Finnish state-owned energy company Gasum says natural gas imports from Russia will be halted on Saturday, after the Finns refused to pay for it in rubles.\n\nRussia demanded payment in rubles after sanctions were imposed against Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nGasum's CEO Mika Wiljanen called it \"highly regrettable\" that the gas supplies will now be stopped.\n\nBut there \"will be no disruptions in the gas supply network,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe group was informed by Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom in April that future payments in the supply contract must be made in Russian currency instead of euros.\n\nIn Finland, natural gas accounted for 6% of the total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said. Almost all gas is imported from Russia and last year the share of Russian natural gas imports was 92%.\n\nPoland and Bulgaria, which also have refused to pay Gazprom in rubles, have had their gas cut off.\n\nANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey's president says he is engaged in \"telephone diplomacy\" with foreign counterparts over the bids by Sweden and Finland to join NATO.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated Friday that his country is determined not to approve membership of the alliance for countries accused by Turkey of supporting what it calls \"terror organizations.\"\n\nErdogan has placed an obstacle to Sweden and Finland joining the alliance. He accuses Stockholm - and to a lesser extent Helsinki -- of supporting the Kurdish Workers' Party, or PKK, and other groups that Turkey views as terrorists and a threat to its national security.\n\nTurkey, which has the second largest army in NATO, also accuses the two Nordic countries of imposing restrictions on exports of defense industry equipment to Turkey and of failing to extradite suspects wanted by Turkey.\n\nErdogan told reporters that he spoke to Netherland's Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Friday and would hold further discussions with British and Finnish leaders on Saturday.\n\nSweden and Finland formally applied to join the military alliance this week. All 30 NATO members need to approve the entry of new members.\n\nWARSAW, Poland -- Poland and Portugal are trying to figure out ways of bringing Ukraine into the European Union even if some countries in the bloc balk at granting it speedy access.\n\nPoland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki announced the effort after talks Friday in Warsaw with visiting Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa.\n\nMorawiecki said that \"if some EU nations protest vehemently, together with Portugal we want to work out an appropriate package that would be attractive for Ukraine and will show that Ukraine's place is in the EU.\"\n\nGermany, for example, has spoken out against a swift EU membership path for Ukraine, which currently fighting a ferocious war against Russia's invasion. All 27 EU members need to approve an enlargement to include Ukraine.\n\nCosta said EU leaders should not stick to inflexible regulations but be \"pragmatic and respond to the current events.\" He urged a decision at an EU summit scheduled for June.\n\nKOENIGSWINTER, Germany -- Germany's finance minister says the Group of Seven leading economies are set to agree on more than $18 billion in aid for Ukrainian defense efforts.\n\nFinance Minister Christian Lindner said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday that Ukrainians resisting Russia's invasion \"are not only defending themselves, they are defending our values.\"\n\nA representative from the U.S. Treasury Department declined to confirm the amount set to be allocated at a meeting of G-7 finance ministers in Germany, and a spokesman from the German finance ministry declined to comment to The Associated Press.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other leaders have spoken this week about the need for allies to put together enough additional aid to help Ukraine \"get through\" the Russian invasion.\n\nKYIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces attacked the cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk in Ukraine's eastern region of Luhansk, the region's governor said Friday.\n\nSerhiy Haidai said in a Telegram messaging app post on Friday that 12 people were killed in Severodonetsk as a result of the assault, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region.\n\nHe added that the attack on Severodonetsk \"was unsuccessful - the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated.\" His remarks could not be independently verified.\n\nUkraine's General Staff in its morning update on Friday also said that the Russians tried to assault Severodonetsk but suffered losses and retreated.\n\nKYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the United States for the $40 billion aid package, which got final congressional approval on Thursday.\n\n\"This is a demonstration of strong leadership and a necessary contribution to our common defense of freedom,\" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation.\n\nHe also thanked the European Union for its support.\n\n\"And for our partners this is not just an expense or a gift. This is their contribution to security,\" Zelenskyy said. \"For defending Ukraine also defends them from new wars and crises that Russia could provoke if it is successful in the war against Ukraine. Therefore, we must together ensure that Russia's aggression against our state has no success, not militarily, economically or any other.\"\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine's monthly budget deficit is $5 billion \"and so to survive in the war for freedom, we need quick and sufficient financial support.\"\n\nThe U.S. has announced a shipment of $100 million in military equipment to Ukraine, separate from what will be coming from the $40 billion approved by Congress. The latest package includes 18 more howitzers as well as anti-artillery radar systems, both of which the U.S. has provided to Ukraine already since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nKYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian troops were intensifying their attacks in the Donbas.\n\n\"It is hell there and that's not an exaggeration,\" he said in his nightly video address to the nation. \"The brutal and completely senseless bombardment of Severodonetsk. Twelve dead and dozens wounded there in just one day.\"\n\nZelenskyy said Russian strikes on the northeastern Chernihiv region included a terrible strike on the village of Desna, where he said many were killed and rescuers were still going through the rubble.\n\n\"The bombing and shelling of our other cities, the air and missile strikes by the Russian army, are not simply military operations in a time of war... It is a conscious and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible,\" Zelenskyy said. \"To destroy more homes, public sites, businesses. This is what will be qualified as genocide of the Ukrainian people and for which the occupiers will definitely be brought to justice.\"\n\nA veteran Russian rock musician faces charges of discrediting the army for remarks made at a concert on Wednesday.\n\nCharges against Yuri Shevchuk, singer for the band DDT, were sent to an administrative court on Thursday. He could face a fine of up to 50,000 rubles ($800).\n\nAfter the war began, Russia passed a more severe law making the spread of \"fake news\" about the conflict punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n\nDuring the concert in Ufa, Shevchuk questioned the aims of the war and why young Russians and Ukrainians are fighting and dying in a war that is also costing the lives of civilians.\n\n\"Old people, women and children are dying,\" he said. \"For some kind of Napoleonic plans of our latest Caesar, yes?\"\n\n\"The motherland, my friends, is not the ass of a president that you have to lick and kiss all the time. The motherland is a poor grandmother selling potatoes at the train station. That is the motherland,\" he added.\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. has announced a shipment of $100 million in military equipment to Ukraine, separate from what will be coming from the $40 billion approved Thursday by Congress.\n\nThe latest package includes 18 more howitzers as well as anti-artillery radar systems, both of which the U.S. has provided to Ukraine already since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said the equipment will be in the hands of Ukrainian forces \"very, very soon.\"\n\nWith this latest shipment, the U.S. has provided nearly $4 billion in military aid since Feb. 24 and $6.6 billion since 2014, when Russia seized and annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine.\n\nKirby said the U.S. will consult with Ukraine, as it has frequently since the invasion, about what it needs in terms of equipment.\n\nWARSAW, Poland - Poland's President Andrzej Duda, the country's defense minister and the U.S. ambassador to Poland watched a joint military exercise dubbed DEFENDER-Europe 22 by Polish, U.S., French and Swedish troops in northeastern Poland on Thursday.\n\nThe troops' task was to cross the Narew River near the town of Nowogrod, in a region about two hours' drive from the borders of Russia's exclave of Kaliningrad and of Russian ally Belarus.\n\nDuda said that, as Ukraine is fighting Russia's invasion, everyone is \"aware of the potential threat\" in the region.\n\nDuda said the exercise -- which had been planned earlier -- would help \"show the cooperation and the efficiency of NATO in collective defense.\"\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Here's a look at some key questions about POWs in Russia's nearly three-month-old war on Ukraine:\n\nWHO IS A PRISONER OF WAR?\n\nArticle 4 of the third Geneva Convention, which focuses on POWs, defines them as any member of armed forces or militias -- including organized resistance movements -- in a conflict who \"who have fallen into the power of the enemy.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

They include issues such as where they can be held; the relief they should receive, including medical help for wounded ex-fighters; and legal proceedings they might face.\n\n\"In this case, the Russian Federation has an entire list of obligations: To treat them humanely, to let the ICRC (have) access to them, to inform the ICRC of their names, to allow them to write to their families, to care for them if they are wounded and sick, to feed them and so on,\" said Marco Sassoli, a professor of international law at the University of Geneva.\n\n\"But obviously, the detaining power may deprive them of their liberty until the end of the international armed conflict and may hold them -- unlike civilians -- on their own territories. So they may be brought to Russia,\" he said.\n\nCAN THEY BE PUT ON TRIAL?\n\nOnly under certain conditions, notably if an individual fighter is accused of committing one or more war crimes. Such an accusation must be based on published evidence, Sassoli said.\n\n\"They can certainly not be punished for having participated in the hostilities, because that's the privilege of combatants and of prisoners of war,\" he said.\n\nCOULD POWS BECOME PART OF PRISONER EXCHANGES?\n\nThe Geneva Conventions do not set rules for prisoner exchanges. In the past, Red Cross intermediaries have helped carry out agreed-upon POW exchanges.\n\nStill, much has been made of the insistence by some Russian officials that detained Ukrainian ex-fighters should face trial and should not be included in any prisoner exchanges.\n\nCOULD RUSSIA CLAIM THE FIGHTERS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO POW STATUS?\n\nSome countries have tried to sidestep their Geneva Conventions obligations -- or simply argue that they're not bound by them.\n\nA prominent case was when the United States detained hundreds of fighters allegedly linked to terrorist groups like al-Qaida. They were detained as \"enemy combatants\" at a U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after the Sept. 11 attacks and the subsequent U.S.-led military operation to topple the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan.\n\nSassoli said there are \"all kinds of reasons\" why an individual might lose their prisoner of war status. For example, if the fighter \"didn't distinguish themselves from the civilian population\" during combat.\n\n\"But here, to the best of my knowledge, no one claims that these people (detainees from the Azov Regiment in Mariupol) didn't wear a uniform, or if they don't belong to the Ukrainian armed forces,\" Sassoli said. \"It's basically Ukraine who decides who belongs to their armed forces.\"\n\nUkrainian leaders have repeatedly touted the regiment's role in the armed forces and have celebrated what they call its members' heroism for holding out so long against far-larger Russian forces.\n\nTHE AZOV REGIMENT IS PART OF THE NATIONAL GUARD -- DOES THAT MATTER?\n\nUkraine and Russia have both accepted an important annex to the Geneva Conventions that broadens the definition of what fighters -- militia or otherwise -- might be considered as part of the national military force, based in part on whether they follow military commands.\n\nAs for the Azov Regiment fighters, \"there's no doubt\" they are part of Ukraine's military force, said Sassoli, who was on a three-person team commissioned by the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe that travelled to Ukraine in March.\n\nHowever, Russia hasn't been fully clear about who is detaining the former Azovstal fighters -- Russia itself, or the breakaway pro-Russian areas in Ukraine such as the so-called \"Donetsk People's Republic\" or the \"Luhansk People's Republic,\" which could blur such distinctions.\n\nWHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RED CROSS STATEMENT?\n\nThursday's statement was the first time since Russia invaded on Feb. 24 that the ICRC -- which plays an often-confidential role to check on prisoners of war -- has said anything officially about POWs in the conflict.\n\n\"Normally, the ICRC will not tell you how these people are treated, but the ICRC will say whom they visited,\" said Sassoli. \"But the ICRC -- to the best of my knowledge, until this media release -- did not clarify how many people it had access to, on both sides.\"\n\nBeyond its communication about the Azovstal fighters, the ICRC has not said whether it has registered other POWs or carried out any visits with POWs on either side of the war.\n\nFollow all AP stories on the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

As of now, 1,908 people have laid down arms,\" Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was quoted by the Russian media as saying Friday.\n\nOn Thursday, the Russian military put the total of surrendered fighters at 1,730. It remains unclear how many fighters are still holed up in the giant steel plant's maze of underground tunnels and bunkers.\n\nDenys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, said Friday that the defenders of Mariupol -- a group of Ukrainian fighters from various military and law enforcement units -- - have received an order to \"cease the defense of the city.\" The intention is to \"save lives and health of the servicemen of the garrison,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in a video statement released on Telegram, Prokopenko also said that \"the seriously wounded received the necessary assistance and they were able to be evacuated with further exchange and delivery to the territory controlled by Ukraine.\"\n\nIt was not clear from the video whether Prokopenko was still at the plant.

It could also include foreign fighters who might have been captured.\n\nA Red Cross statement Friday said the POW visits had enabled it to pass on information to hundreds of families about their loved ones.\n\nThe ICRC did not specify how many families had been informed about their relatives, or where the visits took place.

Fully yes.\"\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov dismissed the proceedings on Wednesday, telling reporters that accusations leveled against Russian soldiers by Ukraine were \"simply fake or staged.\"\n\nMay 17, 6:26 pm\n\nState Department 'confident' in NATO expansion\n\nAs Turkey becomes more vocal about its opposition to Sweden and Finland joining NATO, the State Department said it is still assured of the alliance's unified support for the two prospective members.\n\nState Department spokesperson Ned Price said during a briefing Tuesday that Secretary of State Antony Blinken came away from meetings with NATO allies with a \"sense of confidence there was strong consensus for admitting Finland and Sweden into the alliance if they so choose to join, and we're confident we'll be able to preserve that consensus.\"\n\nPrice said that assessment came from what Blinken heard in conversations behind closed doors.\n\nTurkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has publicly said that both candidates are untrustworthy because he perceives them as being supportive of groups Ankara views as extremist.\n\nThere is speculation that Turkey's opposition is an attempt to leverage the moment to achieve its own policy goals or concessions from the U.S. Price said Tuesday that Turkey has not made any specific requests.\n\nPrice confirmed that Blinken will meet with his Turkish counterpart on the sidelines of the U.N. on Wednesday, adding that \"other conversations are ongoing between and among current NATO allies and potential aspirant countries.\"\n\n-ABC News' Shannon Crawford\n\nMay 17, 2:22 pm\n\nFinland, Sweden to jointly submit applications for NATO membership on Wednesday\n\nSwedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson's office announced Sweden and Finland will jointly submit an application for NATO membership on Wednesday, after she met with Finnish President Sauli Niinist? in Stockholm.\n\n\"It is a message of strength and a clear signal that we stand united going into the future,\" Andersson said in a joint press conference with the Finnish president.\n\nThe two leaders are set to meet President Joe Biden at the White House on Thursday.\n\nThe two countries have stepped away from nonalignment in the wake of Russian's invasion of Ukraine, and fears for their own security.\n\nThe International Criminal Court deployed a team of 42 investigators forensic and support personnel to Ukraine to advance investigations into crimes falling under ICC jurisdiction and provide support to Ukrainian authorities.\n\n\"This represents the largest ever single field deployment by my office since its establishment,\" ICC prosecutor Karim Khan said Tuesday.\n\nKhan said 21 countries have offered to send national experts to his office and 20 states have committed to provide financial contributions.\n\n\"I look forward to working with all actors, including survivor groups, national authorities, civil society organisations and international partners, in order to accelerate this collective work moving forward,\" Khan said.\n\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters Tuesday that the export controls the U.S. and other countries have put on Russia are working, including compliance from China.\n\n\"These export controls are having a strong and significant effect,\" Raimondo said Tuesday.\n\nRaimondo returned from Paris where she co-chaired the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council Ministerial Meeting. She said there was consensus and partnership amongst countries with respect to cutting off Russia's access to \"critical technologies.\"\n\n\"We've had extensive discussions on export controls,\" she said.\n\nThe Commerce Department and 37 other countries have limited semiconductor chips that can be exported to Russia, which help not only everyday Russian carmakers, but the Russian military build and use military equipment.\n\n\"You've all heard the anecdotal stories of Russia's inability to continue to produce tanks and auto companies shutting down but overall U.S. exports to Russia have decreased over 80%, between February and a week ago,\" she said. \"So we essentially stopped sending high tech to Russia, which is what they need for their military.\"\n\nEven China, Raimondo said, stopped shipping tech products such as laptops to Russia by 40% compared to a year ago.\n\nAsked whether she trusts the Chinese data, Raimondo said it is \"consistent\" with what the Ukrainians are seeing on the ground.\n\n\"We are not seeing systematic efforts by China to go around our export controls,\" she said. \"So yes, I think this is probably quite accurate.\"\n\n-ABC News' Luke Barr\n\nMay 17, 9:20 am\n\nBiden to meet with leaders of Sweden, Finland as they seek to join NATO\n\nPresident Joe Biden will host Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson of Sweden and President Sauli Niinist? of Finland at the White House on Thursday as the two countries seek to join NATO, the White House announced Tuesday.\n\nThe three leaders will \"discuss Finland's and Sweden's NATO applications and European security,\" according to a statement from White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.", "source": {"uri": "wfin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFIN"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://wfin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GETTY_51922_RussianSoldiersUkraine-9KMdpg.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7724228", "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 30, "stanza_neu": 128, "stanza_pos": 8, "swn_neg": 166, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7048498222", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "14:00:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T14:00:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T13:59:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "url": "https://www.news-gazette.com/news/nation-world/live-updates-russia-says-fighters-surrender-at-steel-plant/article_698fceec-55a2-5342-b120-e8833266e042.html", "title": "Live updates | Russia says fighters surrender at steel plant", "body": "Russia's defense minister says 1,908 Ukrainian fighters who had been holed up at the Azovstal steelworks, the last pocket of Ukrainian resistance in the port city of Mariupol, have surrendered so far\n\nRussia's defense minister says 1,908 Ukrainian fighters who had been holed up at the Azovstal steelworks, the last pocket of Ukrainian resistance in the port city of Mariupol, have surrendered so far.\n\n\"Nationalists blocked off at the plant started to surrender.

Associated Press\n\nGENEVA (AP) -- Breaking its recent silence on prisoners of war, the Red Cross said Thursday it has registered \"hundreds\" of Ukrainian prisoners of war who left the giant Azovstal steel plant in the southern city of Mariupol after holding out in a weeks-long standoff with besieging Russian forces.\n\nThe announcement by the International Committee of the Red Cross, which acts as a guardian of the Geneva Conventions that aim to limit \"the barbarity of war,\" came shortly after Russia's military said 1,730 Ukrainian troops at the steel mill have surrendered.\n\nAttention now is turning to how those prisoners of war might be treated and what rights they have. Here's a look at some key questions about POWs in Russia's nearly three-month-old war on Ukraine:\n\nWHO IS A PRISONER OF WAR?\n\nArticle 4 of the third Geneva Convention, which focuses on POWs, defines them as any member of armed forces or militias -- including organized resistance movements -- in a conflict who \"who have fallen into the power of the enemy.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

They include issues such as where they can be held; the relief they should receive, including medical help for wounded ex-fighters; and legal proceedings they might face.\n\n\"In this case, the Russian Federation has an entire list of obligations: To treat them humanely, to let the ICRC (have) access to them, to inform the ICRC of their names, to allow them to write to their families, to care for them if they are wounded and sick, to feed them and so on,\" said Marco Sassoli, a professor of international law at the University of Geneva.\n\n\"But obviously, the detaining power may deprive them of their liberty until the end of the international armed conflict and may hold them -- unlike civilians -- on their own territories. So they may be brought to Russia,\" he said.\n\nCAN THEY BE PUT ON TRIAL?\n\nOnly under certain conditions, notably if an individual fighter is accused of committing one or more war crimes. Such an accusation must be based on published evidence, Sassoli said.\n\n\"They can certainly not be punished for having participated in the hostilities, because that's the privilege of combatants and of prisoners of war,\" he said.\n\nCOULD POWS BECOME PART OF PRISONER EXCHANGES?\n\nThe Geneva Conventions do not set rules for prisoner exchanges. In the past, Red Cross intermediaries have helped carry out agreed-upon POW exchanges.\n\nStill, much has been made of the insistence by some Russian officials that detained Ukrainian ex-fighters should face trial and should not be included in any prisoner exchanges.\n\nCOULD RUSSIA CLAIM THE FIGHTERS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO POW STATUS?\n\nSome countries have tried to sidestep their Geneva Conventions obligations -- or simply argue that they're not bound by them.\n\nA prominent case was when the United States detained hundreds of fighters allegedly linked to terrorist groups like al-Qaida. They were detained as \"enemy combatants\" at a U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after the Sept. 11 attacks and the subsequent U.S.-led military operation to topple the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan.\n\nSassoli said there are \"all kinds of reasons\" why an individual might lose their prisoner of war status. For example, if the fighter \"didn't distinguish themselves from the civilian population\" during combat.\n\n\"But here, to the best of my knowledge, no one claims that these people (detainees from the Azov Regiment in Mariupol) didn't wear a uniform, or if they don't belong to the Ukrainian armed forces,\" Sassoli said. \"It's basically Ukraine who decides who belongs to their armed forces.\"\n\nUkrainian leaders have repeatedly touted the regiment's role in the armed forces and have celebrated what they call its members' heroism for holding out so long against far-larger Russian forces.\n\nTHE AZOV REGIMENT IS PART OF THE NATIONAL GUARD -- DOES THAT MATTER?\n\nUkraine and Russia have both accepted an important annex to the Geneva Conventions that broadens the definition of what fighters -- militia or otherwise -- might be considered as part of the national military force, based in part on whether they follow military commands.\n\nAs for the Azov Regiment fighters, \"there's no doubt\" they are part of Ukraine's military force, said Sassoli, who was on a three-person team commissioned by the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe that travelled to Ukraine in March.\n\nHowever, Russia hasn't been fully clear about who is detaining the former Azovstal fighters -- Russia itself, or the breakaway pro-Russian areas in Ukraine such as the so-called \"Donetsk People's Republic\" or the \"Luhansk People's Republic,\" which could blur such distinctions.\n\nWHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RED CROSS STATEMENT?\n\nThursday's statement was the first time since Russia invaded on Feb. 24 that the ICRC -- which plays an often-confidential role to check on prisoners of war -- has said anything officially about POWs in the conflict.\n\n\"Normally, the ICRC will not tell you how these people are treated, but the ICRC will say whom they visited,\" said Sassoli. \"But the ICRC -- to the best of my knowledge, until this media release -- did not clarify how many people it had access to, on both sides.\"\n\nBeyond its communication about the Azovstal fighters, the ICRC has not said whether it has registered other POWs or carried out any visits with POWs on either side of the war.\n\nFollow all AP stories on the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Many more families need answers; the ICRC must have full access to POWs and civilian internees, wherever they are held, in order to provide those answers.\n\nThe nations that agreed to the Geneva Conventions committed to protecting the lives and dignity of people deprived of their liberty during armed conflict. All sides in conflict benefit from ICRC's visits to POWs and civilian internees, a key humanitarian activity and legal obligation,\" said ICRC President Peter Maurer.\n\nThe Geneva Conventions, as well as customary international humanitarian law (IHL), spell out the ICRC's right to visit all POWs and civilian internees, wherever they are held, in international armed conflicts. These visits help ensure respect for their life and dignity by reminding the detaining authorities that the captives' treatment and their conditions of internment or detention must correspond to standards laid down by IHL. This includes access to medical care, food, and water. They also cannot be tortured, intimidated or exposed to violence. In addition, they must be shielded from public curiosity.\n\n\"This is about the fundamental idea of protecting the individual person caught in the machine of conflict, an individual person who needs to be treated humanely, and who has a family deeply worried about their loved one,\" said Florence Anselmo, the head of the ICRC's Central Tracing Agency.\n\nThe Central Tracing Agency, which receives registration information from visits and directly from authorities, has provided hundreds of families on all sides with information about their missing loved ones since the beginning of the international armed conflict in Ukraine.\n\n\"On behalf of all the prisoners of war and their families, we will continue our bilateral dialogue with unabated determination to gain access to all people held captive,\" said Mr Maurer.\n\nNote to editors and producers:\n\n1.

Much of ICRC's work around POWs is confidential and dealt with in our bilateral dialogue with each party. We do not publicly share information about specific cases or the overall conditions or treatment. We are not publicly sharing the number of POWs we visit nor the number of names on lists that are shared with us by the parties to the conflict.\n\n3. One of the ICRC's oldest programmes, the Central Tracing Agency (CTA) is enshrined in the Geneva Conventions. Dating to 1870, the CTA today is at the heart of the ICRC's efforts around the globe to protect and maintain family connections, search for and identify missing persons, protect the dignity of the dead, and ensure that the needs of missing people's families are addressed.\n\n4. Established in 1863, the ICRC operates worldwide, helping people affected by conflict and armed violence and promoting the laws that protect victims of war. A neutral, independent and impartial organization, its mandate stems from the Geneva Conventions of 1949. it is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and works in more than 100 countries.\n\n5.

Here's a look at some key questions about POWs in Russia's nearly three-month-old war on Ukraine:\n\nWHO IS A PRISONER OF WAR?\n\nArticle 4 of the third Geneva Convention, which focuses on POWs, defines them as any member of armed forces or militias -- including organized resistance movements -- in a conflict who \"who have fallen into the power of the enemy.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

But don't expect him to show up in Dobson.\n\nIt also includes non-combatant crew members, war correspondents and even \"inhabitants of a non-occupied territory who, on the approach of the enemy, spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces.\"\n\nWHAT RIGHTS DO POWS HAVE?\n\nThe Geneva Conventions set out requirements to ensure that POWs are treated humanely. They include issues such as where they can be held; the relief they should receive, including medical help for wounded ex-fighters; and legal proceedings they might face.\n\n\"In this case, the Russian Federation has an entire list of obligations: To treat them humanely, to let the ICRC (have) access to them, to inform the ICRC of their names, to allow them to write to their families, to care for them if they are wounded and sick, to feed them and so on,\" said Marco Sassoli, a professor of international law at the University of Geneva.\n\n\"But obviously, the detaining power may deprive them of their liberty until the end of the international armed conflict and may hold them -- unlike civilians -- on their own territories. So they may be brought to Russia,\" he said.\n\nCAN THEY BE PUT ON TRIAL?\n\nOnly under certain conditions, notably if an individual fighter is accused of committing one or more war crimes. Such an accusation must be based on published evidence, Sassoli said.\n\n\"They can certainly not be punished for having participated in the hostilities, because that's the privilege of combatants and of prisoners of war,\" he said.\n\nCOULD POWS BECOME PART OF PRISONER EXCHANGES?\n\nThe Geneva Conventions do not set rules for prisoner exchanges. In the past, Red Cross intermediaries have helped carry out agreed-upon POW exchanges.\n\nStill, much has been made of the insistence by some Russian officials that detained Ukrainian ex-fighters should face trial and should not be included in any prisoner exchanges.\n\nCOULD RUSSIA CLAIM THE FIGHTERS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO POW STATUS?\n\nSome countries have tried to sidestep their Geneva Conventions obligations -- or simply argue that they're not bound by them.\n\nA prominent case was when the United States detained hundreds of fighters allegedly linked to terrorist groups like al-Qaida. They were detained as \"enemy combatants\" at a U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after the Sept. 11 attacks and the subsequent U.S.-led military operation to topple the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan.\n\nSassoli said there are \"all kinds of reasons\" why an individual might lose their prisoner of war status. For example, if the fighter \"didn't distinguish themselves from the civilian population\" during combat.\n\n\"But here, to the best of my knowledge, no one claims that these people (detainees from the Azov Regiment in Mariupol) didn't wear a uniform, or if they don't belong to the Ukrainian armed forces,\" Sassoli said. \"It's basically Ukraine who decides who belongs to their armed forces.\"\n\nUkrainian leaders have repeatedly touted the regiment's role in the armed forces and have celebrated what they call its members' heroism for holding out so long against far-larger Russian forces.\n\nTHE AZOV REGIMENT IS PART OF THE NATIONAL GUARD -- DOES THAT MATTER?\n\nUkraine and Russia have both accepted an important annex to the Geneva Conventions that broadens the definition of what fighters -- militia or otherwise -- might be considered as part of the national military force, based in part on whether they follow military commands.\n\nAs for the Azov Regiment fighters, \"there's no doubt\" they are part of Ukraine's military force, said Sassoli, who was on a three-person team commissioned by the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe that travelled to Ukraine in March.\n\nHowever, Russia hasn't been fully clear about who is detaining the former Azovstal fighters -- Russia itself, or the breakaway pro-Russian areas in Ukraine such as the so-called \"Donetsk People's Republic\" or the \"Luhansk People's Republic,\" which could blur such distinctions.\n\nWHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RED CROSS STATEMENT?\n\nThursday's statement was the first time since Russia invaded on Feb. 24 that the ICRC -- which plays an often-confidential role to check on prisoners of war -- has said anything officially about POWs in the conflict.\n\n\"Normally, the ICRC will not tell you how these people are treated, but the ICRC will say whom they visited,\" said Sassoli. \"But the ICRC -- to the best of my knowledge, until this media release -- did not clarify how many people it had access to, on both sides.\"\n\nBeyond its communication about the Azovstal fighters, the ICRC has not said whether it has registered other POWs or carried out any visits with POWs on either side of the war.\n\nFollow all AP stories on the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

It could also include foreign fighters who might have been captured.\n\nA Red Cross statement Friday said the POW visits had enabled it to pass on information to hundreds of families about their loved ones.\n\nThe ICRC did not specify how many families had been informed about their relatives, or where the visits took place. It said only that the visits had taken place \"in recent months.\"\n\nThe statement came a day after the humanitarian agency broke its silence about prisoners of war in the nearly three-month-long conflict, announcing it has registered \"hundreds\" of Ukrainian prisoners of war this week from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. It remains unclear how many fighters are still holed up in the giant steel plant's maze of underground tunnels and bunkers.\n\n\"Many more families need answers; the ICRC must have full access to POWs and civilian internees, wherever they are held, in order to provide those answers,\" the Geneva-based organization said.\n\nSome humanitarian law experts have questioned why the ICRC took so long to announce its POW visits, a key part of its mandate.\n\nThe ICRC often operates confidentially in its role to help protect civilians, prisoners of war and other noncombatants in conflicts, and ensure the respect of the rules of war.\n\n___\n\nKOENIGSWINTER, Germany -- Germany's finance minister says the Group of Seven leading economies and global financial institutions are providing $19.8 billion in aid to bolster Ukraine's public finances.\n\nFinance Minister Christian Lindner told reporters Friday that $9.5 billion of the total was mobilized at meetings of the G-7 finance ministers in Koenigswinter, Germany, this week.\n\nHe said the goal is to ensure that Ukraine's financial situation does not affect its ability to defend itself against Russia's invasion.\n\n\"We agreed on concrete actions to deepen multilateral economic cooperation and underlined our commitment to our united response to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and to our unwavering support to Ukraine,\" a G-7 statement said.\n\n___\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Finnish state-owned energy company Gasum says natural gas imports from Russia will be halted on Saturday, after the Finns refused to pay for it in rubles.\n\nRussia demanded payment in rubles after sanctions were imposed against Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nGasum's CEO Mika Wiljanen called it \"highly regrettable\" that the gas supplies will now be stopped.\n\nBut there \"will be no disruptions in the gas supply network,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe group was informed by Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom in April that future payments in the supply contract must be made in Russian currency instead of euros.\n\nIn Finland, natural gas accounted for 6% of the total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said. Almost all gas is imported from Russia and last year the share of Russian natural gas imports was 92%.\n\nPoland and Bulgaria, which also have refused to pay Gazprom in rubles, have had their gas cut off.\n\n___\n\nANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey's president says he is engaged in \"telephone diplomacy\" with foreign counterparts over the bids by Sweden and Finland to join NATO.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated Friday that his country is determined not to approve membership of the alliance for countries accused by Turkey of supporting what it calls \"terror organizations.\"\n\nErdogan has placed an obstacle to Sweden and Finland joining the alliance. He accuses Stockholm - and to a lesser extent Helsinki -- of supporting the Kurdish Workers' Party, or PKK, and other groups that Turkey views as terrorists and a threat to its national security.\n\nTurkey, which has the second largest army in NATO, also accuses the two Nordic countries of imposing restrictions on exports of defense industry equipment to Turkey and of failing to extradite suspects wanted by Turkey.\n\nErdogan told reporters that he spoke to Netherland's Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Friday and would hold further discussions with British and Finnish leaders on Saturday.\n\nSweden and Finland formally applied to join the military alliance this week. All 30 NATO members need to approve the entry of new members.\n\n___\n\nWARSAW, Poland -- Poland and Portugal are trying to figure out ways of bringing Ukraine into the European Union even if some countries in the bloc balk at granting it speedy access.\n\nPoland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki announced the effort after talks Friday in Warsaw with visiting Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa.\n\nMorawiecki said that \"if some EU nations protest vehemently, together with Portugal we want to work out an appropriate package that would be attractive for Ukraine and will show that Ukraine's place is in the EU.\"\n\nGermany, for example, has spoken out against a swift EU membership path for Ukraine, which currently fighting a ferocious war against Russia's invasion. All 27 EU members need to approve an enlargement to include Ukraine.\n\nCosta said EU leaders should not stick to inflexible regulations but be \"pragmatic and respond to the current events.\" He urged a decision at an EU summit scheduled for June.\n\n___\n\nKOENIGSWINTER, Germany -- Germany's finance minister says the Group of Seven leading economies are set to agree on more than $18 billion in aid for Ukrainian defense efforts.\n\nFinance Minister Christian Lindner said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday that Ukrainians resisting Russia's invasion \"are not only defending themselves, they are defending our values.\"\n\nA representative from the U.S. Treasury Department declined to confirm the amount set to be allocated at a meeting of G-7 finance ministers in Germany, and a spokesman from the German finance ministry declined to comment to The Associated Press.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other leaders have spoken this week about the need for allies to put together enough additional aid to help Ukraine \"get through\" the Russian invasion.\n\n___\n\nKYIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces attacked the cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk in Ukraine's eastern region of Luhansk, the region's governor said Friday.\n\nSerhiy Haidai said in a Telegram messaging app post on Friday that 12 people were killed in Severodonetsk as a result of the assault, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region.\n\nHe added that the attack on Severodonetsk \"was unsuccessful - the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated.\" His remarks could not be independently verified.\n\nUkraine's General Staff in its morning update on Friday also said that the Russians tried to assault Severodonetsk but suffered losses and retreated.\n\n___\n\nKYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the United States for the $40 billion aid package, which got final congressional approval on Thursday.\n\n\"This is a demonstration of strong leadership and a necessary contribution to our common defense of freedom,\" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation.\n\nHe also thanked the European Union for its support.\n\n\"And for our partners this is not just an expense or a gift. This is their contribution to security,\" Zelenskyy said. \"For defending Ukraine also defends them from new wars and crises that Russia could provoke if it is successful in the war against Ukraine. Therefore, we must together ensure that Russia's aggression against our state has no success, not militarily, economically or any other.\"\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine's monthly budget deficit is $5 billion \"and so to survive in the war for freedom, we need quick and sufficient financial support.\"\n\nThe U.S. has announced a shipment of $100 million in military equipment to Ukraine, separate from what will be coming from the $40 billion approved by Congress. The latest package includes 18 more howitzers as well as anti-artillery radar systems, both of which the U.S. has provided to Ukraine already since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\n___\n\nKYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian troops were intensifying their attacks in the Donbas.\n\n\"It is hell there and that's not an exaggeration,\" he said in his nightly video address to the nation. \"The brutal and completely senseless bombardment of Severodonetsk. Twelve dead and dozens wounded there in just one day.\"\n\nZelenskyy said Russian strikes on the northeastern Chernihiv region included a terrible strike on the village of Desna, where he said many were killed and rescuers were still going through the rubble.\n\n\"The bombing and shelling of our other cities, the air and missile strikes by the Russian army, are not simply military operations in a time of war... It is a conscious and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible,\" Zelenskyy said. \"To destroy more homes, public sites, businesses.

It could also include foreign fighters who might have been captured.\n\nA Red Cross statement Friday said the POW visits had enabled it to pass on information to hundreds of families about their loved ones.\n\nThe ICRC did not specify how many families had been informed about their relatives, or where the visits took place. It said only that the visits had taken place \"in recent months.\"\n\nThe statement came a day after the humanitarian agency broke its silence about prisoners of war in the nearly three-month-long conflict, announcing it has registered \"hundreds\" of Ukrainian prisoners of war this week from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol.

He accuses Stockholm - and to a lesser extent Helsinki -- of supporting the Kurdish Workers' Party, or PKK, and other groups that Turkey views as terrorists and a threat to its national security.\n\nTurkey, which has the second largest army in NATO, also accuses the two Nordic countries of imposing restrictions on exports of defense industry equipment to Turkey and of failing to extradite suspects wanted by Turkey.\n\nErdogan told reporters that he spoke to Netherland's Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Friday and would hold further discussions with British and Finnish leaders on Saturday.\n\nSweden and Finland formally applied to join the military alliance this week.

As of now, 1,908 people have laid down arms,\" Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was quoted by the Russian media as saying Friday.\n\nOn Thursday, the Russian military put the total of surrendered fighters at 1,730. It remains unclear how many fighters are still holed up in the giant steel plant's maze of underground tunnels and bunkers.\n\nDenys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, said Friday that the defenders of Mariupol -- a group of Ukrainian fighters from various military and law enforcement units -- - have received an order to \"cease the defense of the city.\" The intention is to \"save lives and health of the servicemen of the garrison,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in a video statement released on Telegram, Prokopenko also said that \"the seriously wounded received the necessary assistance and they were able to be evacuated with further exchange and delivery to the territory controlled by Ukraine.\"\n\nIt was not clear from the video whether Prokopenko was still at the plant.

It said only that the visits had taken place \"in recent months.\"\n\nThe statement came a day after the humanitarian agency broke its silence about prisoners of war in the nearly three-month-long conflict, announcing it has registered \"hundreds\" of Ukrainian prisoners of war this week from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. It remains unclear how many fighters are still holed up in the giant steel plant's maze of underground tunnels and bunkers.\n\n\"Many more families need answers; the ICRC must have full access to POWs and civilian internees, wherever they are held, in order to provide those answers,\" the Geneva-based organization said.\n\nSome humanitarian law experts have questioned why the ICRC took so long to announce its POW visits, a key part of its mandate.\n\nThe ICRC often operates confidentially in its role to help protect civilians, prisoners of war and other noncombatants in conflicts, and ensure the respect of the rules of war.\n\nKOENIGSWINTER, Germany -- Germany's finance minister says the Group of Seven leading economies and global financial institutions are providing $19.8 billion in aid to bolster Ukraine's public finances.\n\nFinance Minister Christian Lindner told reporters Friday that $9.5 billion of the total was mobilized at meetings of the G-7 finance ministers in Koenigswinter, Germany, this week.\n\nHe said the goal is to ensure that Ukraine's financial situation does not affect its ability to defend itself against Russia's invasion.\n\n\"We agreed on concrete actions to deepen multilateral economic cooperation and underlined our commitment to our united response to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and to our unwavering support to Ukraine,\" a G-7 statement said.\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Finnish state-owned energy company Gasum says natural gas imports from Russia will be halted on Saturday, after the Finns refused to pay for it in rubles.\n\nRussia demanded payment in rubles after sanctions were imposed against Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nGasum's CEO Mika Wiljanen called it \"highly regrettable\" that the gas supplies will now be stopped.\n\nBut there \"will be no disruptions in the gas supply network,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe group was informed by Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom in April that future payments in the supply contract must be made in Russian currency instead of euros.\n\nIn Finland, natural gas accounted for 6% of the total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said. Almost all gas is imported from Russia and last year the share of Russian natural gas imports was 92%.\n\nPoland and Bulgaria, which also have refused to pay Gazprom in rubles, have had their gas cut off.\n\nANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey's president says he is engaged in \"telephone diplomacy\" with foreign counterparts over the bids by Sweden and Finland to join NATO.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated Friday that his country is determined not to approve membership of the alliance for countries accused by Turkey of supporting what it calls \"terror organizations.\"\n\nErdogan has placed an obstacle to Sweden and Finland joining the alliance. He accuses Stockholm - and to a lesser extent Helsinki -- of supporting the Kurdish Workers' Party, or PKK, and other groups that Turkey views as terrorists and a threat to its national security.\n\nTurkey, which has the second largest army in NATO, also accuses the two Nordic countries of imposing restrictions on exports of defense industry equipment to Turkey and of failing to extradite suspects wanted by Turkey.\n\nErdogan told reporters that he spoke to Netherland's Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Friday and would hold further discussions with British and Finnish leaders on Saturday.\n\nSweden and Finland formally applied to join the military alliance this week.

All 27 EU members need to approve an enlargement to include Ukraine.\n\nCosta said EU leaders should not stick to inflexible regulations but be \"pragmatic and respond to the current events.\" He urged a decision at an EU summit scheduled for June.\n\nKOENIGSWINTER, Germany -- Germany's finance minister says the Group of Seven leading economies are set to agree on more than $18 billion in aid for Ukrainian defense efforts.\n\nFinance Minister Christian Lindner said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday that Ukrainians resisting Russia's invasion \"are not only defending themselves, they are defending our values.\"\n\nA representative from the U.S. Treasury Department declined to confirm the amount set to be allocated at a meeting of G-7 finance ministers in Germany, and a spokesman from the German finance ministry declined to comment to The Associated Press.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other leaders have spoken this week about the need for allies to put together enough additional aid to help Ukraine \"get through\" the Russian invasion.\n\nKYIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces attacked the cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk in Ukraine's eastern region of Luhansk, the region's governor said Friday.\n\nSerhiy Haidai said in a Telegram messaging app post on Friday that 12 people were killed in Severodonetsk as a result of the assault, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region.\n\nHe added that the attack on Severodonetsk \"was unsuccessful - the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated.\" His remarks could not be independently verified.\n\nUkraine's General Staff in its morning update on Friday also said that the Russians tried to assault Severodonetsk but suffered losses and retreated.\n\nKYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the United States for the $40 billion aid package, which got final congressional approval on Thursday.\n\n\"This is a demonstration of strong leadership and a necessary contribution to our common defense of freedom,\" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation.\n\nHe also thanked the European Union for its support.\n\n\"And for our partners this is not just an expense or a gift. This is their contribution to security,\" Zelenskyy said. \"For defending Ukraine also defends them from new wars and crises that Russia could provoke if it is successful in the war against Ukraine. Therefore, we must together ensure that Russia's aggression against our state has no success, not militarily, economically or any other.\"\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine's monthly budget deficit is $5 billion \"and so to survive in the war for freedom, we need quick and sufficient financial support.\"\n\nThe U.S. has announced a shipment of $100 million in military equipment to Ukraine, separate from what will be coming from the $40 billion approved by Congress. The latest package includes 18 more howitzers as well as anti-artillery radar systems, both of which the U.S. has provided to Ukraine already since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nKYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian troops were intensifying their attacks in the Donbas.\n\n\"It is hell there and that's not an exaggeration,\" he said in his nightly video address to the nation. \"The brutal and completely senseless bombardment of Severodonetsk. Twelve dead and dozens wounded there in just one day.\"\n\nZelenskyy said Russian strikes on the northeastern Chernihiv region included a terrible strike on the village of Desna, where he said many were killed and rescuers were still going through the rubble.\n\n\"The bombing and shelling of our other cities, the air and missile strikes by the Russian army, are not simply military operations in a time of war... It is a conscious and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible,\" Zelenskyy said. \"To destroy more homes, public sites, businesses. This is what will be qualified as genocide of the Ukrainian people and for which the occupiers will definitely be brought to justice.\"\n\nA veteran Russian rock musician faces charges of discrediting the army for remarks made at a concert on Wednesday.\n\nCharges against Yuri Shevchuk, singer for the band DDT, were sent to an administrative court on Thursday. He could face a fine of up to 50,000 rubles ($800).\n\nAfter the war began, Russia passed a more severe law making the spread of \"fake news\" about the conflict punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n\nDuring the concert in Ufa, Shevchuk questioned the aims of the war and why young Russians and Ukrainians are fighting and dying in a war that is also costing the lives of civilians.\n\n\"Old people, women and children are dying,\" he said. \"For some kind of Napoleonic plans of our latest Caesar, yes?\"\n\n\"The motherland, my friends, is not the ass of a president that you have to lick and kiss all the time. The motherland is a poor grandmother selling potatoes at the train station. That is the motherland,\" he added.\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. has announced a shipment of $100 million in military equipment to Ukraine, separate from what will be coming from the $40 billion approved Thursday by Congress.\n\nThe latest package includes 18 more howitzers as well as anti-artillery radar systems, both of which the U.S. has provided to Ukraine already since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Here's a look at some key questions about POWs in Russia's nearly three-month-old war on Ukraine:\n\nWHO IS A PRISONER OF WAR?\n\nArticle 4 of the third Geneva Convention, which focuses on POWs, defines them as any member of armed forces or militias -- including organized resistance movements -- in a conflict who \"who have fallen into the power of the enemy.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

They include issues such as where they can be held; the relief they should receive, including medical help for wounded ex-fighters; and legal proceedings they might face.\n\n\"In this case, the Russian Federation has an entire list of obligations: To treat them humanely, to let the ICRC (have) access to them, to inform the ICRC of their names, to allow them to write to their families, to care for them if they are wounded and sick, to feed them and so on,\" said Marco Sassoli, a professor of international law at the University of Geneva.\n\n\"But obviously, the detaining power may deprive them of their liberty until the end of the international armed conflict and may hold them -- unlike civilians -- on their own territories. So they may be brought to Russia,\" he said.\n\nCAN THEY BE PUT ON TRIAL?\n\nOnly under certain conditions, notably if an individual fighter is accused of committing one or more war crimes. Such an accusation must be based on published evidence, Sassoli said.\n\n\"They can certainly not be punished for having participated in the hostilities, because that's the privilege of combatants and of prisoners of war,\" he said.\n\nCOULD POWS BECOME PART OF PRISONER EXCHANGES?\n\nThe Geneva Conventions do not set rules for prisoner exchanges. In the past, Red Cross intermediaries have helped carry out agreed-upon POW exchanges.\n\nStill, much has been made of the insistence by some Russian officials that detained Ukrainian ex-fighters should face trial and should not be included in any prisoner exchanges.\n\nCOULD RUSSIA CLAIM THE FIGHTERS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO POW STATUS?\n\nSome countries have tried to sidestep their Geneva Conventions obligations -- or simply argue that they're not bound by them.\n\nA prominent case was when the United States detained hundreds of fighters allegedly linked to terrorist groups like al-Qaida. They were detained as \"enemy combatants\" at a U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after the Sept. 11 attacks and the subsequent U.S.-led military operation to topple the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan.\n\nSassoli said there are \"all kinds of reasons\" why an individual might lose their prisoner of war status. For example, if the fighter \"didn't distinguish themselves from the civilian population\" during combat.\n\n\"But here, to the best of my knowledge, no one claims that these people (detainees from the Azov Regiment in Mariupol) didn't wear a uniform, or if they don't belong to the Ukrainian armed forces,\" Sassoli said. \"It's basically Ukraine who decides who belongs to their armed forces.\"\n\nUkrainian leaders have repeatedly touted the regiment's role in the armed forces and have celebrated what they call its members' heroism for holding out so long against far-larger Russian forces.\n\nTHE AZOV REGIMENT IS PART OF THE NATIONAL GUARD -- DOES THAT MATTER?\n\nUkraine and Russia have both accepted an important annex to the Geneva Conventions that broadens the definition of what fighters -- militia or otherwise -- might be considered as part of the national military force, based in part on whether they follow military commands.\n\nAs for the Azov Regiment fighters, \"there's no doubt\" they are part of Ukraine's military force, said Sassoli, who was on a three-person team commissioned by the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe that travelled to Ukraine in March.\n\nHowever, Russia hasn't been fully clear about who is detaining the former Azovstal fighters -- Russia itself, or the breakaway pro-Russian areas in Ukraine such as the so-called \"Donetsk People's Republic\" or the \"Luhansk People's Republic,\" which could blur such distinctions.\n\nWHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RED CROSS STATEMENT?\n\nThursday's statement was the first time since Russia invaded on Feb. 24 that the ICRC -- which plays an often-confidential role to check on prisoners of war -- has said anything officially about POWs in the conflict.\n\n\"Normally, the ICRC will not tell you how these people are treated, but the ICRC will say whom they visited,\" said Sassoli. \"But the ICRC -- to the best of my knowledge, until this media release -- did not clarify how many people it had access to, on both sides.\"\n\nBeyond its communication about the Azovstal fighters, the ICRC has not said whether it has registered other POWs or carried out any visits with POWs on either side of the war.\n\nFollow all AP stories on the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

It was later revised alongside the pre-dating Convention protecting the war wounded and remains in force today as the third of the four 1949 Geneva Conventions. In 1929, the adoption of this first multilateral treaty entirely dedicated to the protection of prisoners of war (POW) filled an important gap in the international legal framework and crystallized a major shift in the way prisoners of war were perceived, fully recognizing them as 'humanitarian subjects.'\n\nThe 1929 Geneva Convention found its roots in the traumatizing experience of WWI captivity. Almost ten million people were imprisoned or interned at some point during the conflict, many facing brutalization and mistreatment. But the 1929 Convention was also a direct consequence of the ICRC's large-scale humanitarian action during WWI in favor of POWs. The measures of protection and assistance it introduced during the conflict became part of international humanitarian law (IHL) in 1929 and have oriented its action ever since. Following the recent launch of the updated ICRC Commentary on the Third Geneva Convention, we're travelling back in time to retrace the parallel development of the ICRC's action and IHL for prisoners of war - as reflected in the ICRC Library's collections.\n\nFollow this link to view the timeline in full screen.\n\nBack to the Beginning: The Origin of the ICRC's Action for Prisoners of War\n\nHumanitarian relief to persons deprived of their liberty has been a cornerstone of the ICRC's action for decades and decades. When it was first founded in 1863 however, the Committee was initially reluctant to undertake such a task. It feared it would compromise its initial mission and wished to focus on the fate of the war wounded. In its early years of activity, the Committee thus distinguished between able-bodied and injured or sick prisoners of war. This distinction soon had to be reconsidered, once the Committee's plans were faced with the reality of war. Not only were the health conditions of prisoners difficult to determine, but the Committee also grew extremely concerned with the psychological sufferings of captives, what would soon be known as 'barbed-wire disease'.\n\nThe first exception was made in 1870, during the Franco-Prussian war. The ICRC founded a correspondence and information agency for prisoners - whether sick, wounded, or able-bodied - on the basis of a resolution adopted at the International Conference of the Red Cross in 1869. Set in Basel, this agency was tasked with the transmission of all communications relating to POWs and the expedition of relief to the camps. Under the name 'Agence de B\u00e2le' (Basel Agency), this first ancestor of the ICRC's Central Tracing Agency also allowed prisoners to correspond with their families. The Basel Agency chronicled its activities in a series of twenty reports, published between August 1870 and May 1871. Still, the Committee insisted in a circular to National Societies of the International Movement of the Red Cross (later shortened as 'the Movement' in this blogpost) that it had only extended its action to all able-bodied POWs because it had been unable to single out injured and sick prisoners.\n\nThe situation evolved with the adoption of the Convention with Respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land at the end of the 1899 Hague Peace Conference. Articles 14 and 15 of the Convention compelled belligerents to set up information offices for POWs, to let the other parties know who had fallen into their hands, and to accept the distribution of relief to POW camps by aid societies. National Societies of the Movement saw an opening here: there was a legal basis for relief action for POWs. Extending Red Cross humanitarian action to POWs was at the heart of the discussions of the 1902 and 1907 International Conferences. Finally, the 1912 Conference endorsed this development with a resolution. It was decided that the ICRC would in wartime manage an agency in charge of the transmission of information and relief for POWs - like the one established in Basel in 1870. At the time, it seemed to be the logical conclusion of the discussions of the past decade, rather than a revolution in the Movement's mandate. The 1912 resolution was first implemented during the Balkan War of 1912-1913 with the creation of the Belgrade Agency. But it was truly during WWI that it would revolutionize the ICRC's action and open the door to the revision of the international legal framework for the treatment of POWs.\n\n\"The Heart of Europe\": ICRC action for Prisoners of War during WWI\n\nIn 1914, as the world went to war, the ICRC opened the Agence Internationale des prisonniers de guerre (International Prisoners of War Agency) - which the author Stefan Zweig would later describe as \"the heart of Europe\".[1] For the duration of the conflict, the Agency acted as a neutral intermediary between belligerents for the transmission of information on POWs and recorded every piece of information it could collect on the victims of the hostilities. Its collaborators investigated the fate of missing soldiers on behalf of their families. Every week, the Agency published its Nouvelles to share information about its activities and how to use its services: how to send a tracing request for someone who had gone missing, how to send a parcel to a prisoner, how to request the repatriation of an injured prisoner. The publication of the Nouvelles was then an important part of the ICRC's public communication strategy. The organization took to heart its role as a neutral intermediary not only in the transmission of information between belligerents, but also in the communication of reliable information to civil society, in a climate marked by propaganda and disinformation.\n\nThe International Prisoners of War Agency in pictures\n\nICRC delegates delivering relief and organizing the transmission of correspondence to POW camps started to enquire about the prisoners' conditions of detention. The ICRC advocated for their rights through diplomatic channels and negotiated with the belligerents to be allowed to visit the camps. From 1915 to 1918, its delegates visited 534 POW camps, mainly in Europe but also in North Africa and Asia. Reports of those visits were published at the time as a source of information on POWs' fate untainted by war propaganda. Concerned with the psychological consequences of prolonged captivity, the ICRC requested the repatriation of long-term prisoners of war, even when they were in good physical health. As the scale, duration and intensity of the war turned captivity into a global phenomenon, the days of restricting its humanitarian action to sick and injured prisoners were long gone. For further reading, see our research guide on the ICRC during WWI.\n\nThe Path to the 1929 Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War\n\nThe pre-war norms related to the treatment of POWs were continuously violated during WWI, with belligerents justifying mistreatments as reprisals for alleged violations by their opponent. The treatment of POWs became a central element of war propaganda. The need for a more effective protection was acute. At the end of the war, the ICRC set in motion the process leading the 1929 Convention. In 1921, it brought the issue to the forefront at the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, which reunited representatives of State parties to the Geneva Conventions and members of the Movement: couldn't the agreements concluded late in the conflict between belligerents [2] be capitalized on to develop a multilateral convention harmonizing the treatment and repatriation of POWs in future conflicts?\n\nTwo years later the ICRC submitted to the next International Conference a draft project of a Convention relative to the treatment of POWs. If a few of its original propositions - like a maximum time of two years in captivity - were deemed unrealistic, the Swiss authorities accepted to convene a diplomatic conference to adopt a revised version of the ICRC's draft Convention. The Conference opened in Geneva on July 1. On July 27 1929, the Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War was adopted.\n\nThe 1929 Convention did not run counter to the principles for the treatment of POWs set in the 1899 and 1907 Hague Treaties, but it introduced crucial new provisions and mechanisms for compliance. Most notably, it prohibited reprisals and collective penalties, allowed prisoners the right to choose their representatives, and, recognizing the role played by protecting powers during WWI, introduced a form of neutral oversight of the treatments of POWs. The ICRC's action during WWI was formally recognized, and not only because its right to offer its humanitarian services was included in the treaty. The adoption of an article on the organization of a \"Central Agency of information regarding prisoners of war\" in a neutral country was indeed a direct consequence of the immense humanitarian task accomplished by the Agency during the WW1.\n\nAs Lindsay Cameron and Neville Wylie argue [3], the adoption of the 1929 Convention reflected an important evolution in the conception of the prisoner of war. From a 'disarmed combatant' whose treatment was to be based on martial values and military honor, he became a 'humanitarian subject', a victim of the conflict worthy of a protected status like the one granted to the war wounded. Arguing for the repatriation of able-bodied prisoners, for their right to communicate with their families, and for the prohibition of reprisals, the ICRC had pathed the way to this new idea during WWI.\n\nICRC Action for Prisoners of War after 1929\n\nThere was hope that the 1929 Convention would remain \"buried in the dark corners of chancery offices and libraries\", as ICRC member Georges Werner concluded. [4] But war broke out In September 1939, and the ICRC opened without delay the 'Agence centrale des prisonniers de guerre' (Central Prisoners of War Agency). The mandate of this Agency followed the framework developed during WWI, now recognized in international law. The Agency also resumed the publication of its Nouvelles: nearly 1'300 pages chronicle its activities between 1940 and 1947. But this time the journal served the Agency's internal communication, rather than being distributed to a wider audience.\n\nThe Central Prisoners of War Agency in pictures\n\nAlongside the work of its Agency, the ICRC set up major relief campaigns for POWs during WWII. The logistical challenges of this action are presented in a 1943 publication, which illustrated the journey of the packages shipped to camps. The Committee also founded an Intellectual Relief Service, which sent prisoners all kinds of books - adventure novels, study books, newspapers and magazines, prayer books - as well as board games and musical instruments. Although it had not been directly active in intellectual relief during WWI, the ICRC had recognized the benefits of this type of action to lessen the sufferings of POWs and had included the right to intellectual assistance in its draft of the future 1929 Convention. For further reading, see our research guide on the ICRC during WWII.\n\nFollow this link to view the story map in full screen.\n\nThe ICRC's Agency for prisoners of war never officially closed its doors at the end of WWII. On top of dealing with the humanitarian fallout of the conflict, such as helping repatriate former POWs, it soon became involved in a succession of new contexts. Similar to the 1929 Convention, the 1949 Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War provides a basis for the functioning of the Central Prisoners of War Information Agency. [5] Its name was changed to 'Central Tracing Agency' in 1960 to reflect the evolution of its mandate, now covering assistance not only to POWs, but also to displaced populations, and its engagement in tracing activities , and reconnecting separated family members in conflict zones. At the same time as the Agency diversified its activities, the ICRC continued to develop its action for persons deprived of their liberty in conflict situations. Today its detention related activities aim to preserve the life and dignity of detainees and ensure the respect of international laws and minimum standards. They focus on ending and preventing summary executions, forced disappearances, torture and ill-treatments, safeguarding the physical and psychological integrity of detainees, allowing them to stay in touch with their relatives and supporting their reintegration.
