began, capping a nearly three-month siege that left a city in ruins and more than 20,000 residents feared dead.\n\nAfter the Russian Defense Ministry announced late Friday that its forces had removed the last Ukrainian fighters from the plant's miles of underground tunnels, concern mounted for the Ukrainian defenders who now are prisoners in Russian hands.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the head of an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, said Saturday that the Ukrainians, considered heroes by their fellow citizens, were sure to face a tribunal for their wartime actions.\n\n\"I

Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance, and with it completing Moscow's long-sought goal of controlling the city, home to a strategic seaport.\n\nUkraine's military this week told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe end of the battle for Mariupol would help Putin offset some stinging setbacks, including the failure of Russian troops to take over Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, the sinking of the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea and the continued resistance that has stalled an offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe impact of Russia's declared victory on the broader war in Ukraine remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict, which began when Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base in the Black Sea region of Odesa as well as a significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn its morning operational report, the Ukrainian military general staff reported heavy fighting in much of eastern Ukraine, including the areas of Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nAfter failing to capture Kyiv, Russia focused its offensive on the country's eastern industrial heartland. The Russia-backed separatists have controlled parts of the Donbas region since 2014, and Moscow wants to expand the territory under its control.\n\nThe seizure of Mariupol furthers Russia's quest to essentially create a land bridge from Russia stretching through the Donbas region to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Saturday that Russia was working to restore the port and remove mines.\n\nUkraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, demanded anew that Russia pay \"in one way or another for everything it has destroyed in Ukraine. Every burned house. Every ruined school, ruined hospital. Each blown up house of culture and infrastructure facility. Every destroyed enterprise.\"\n\n\"Of course, the Russian state will not even recognize that it is an aggressor,\" he said in an address late Friday. \"But its recognition is not required.\"\n\nZelenskyy expressed gratitude to his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, who signed off Saturday on a fresh, $40 billion infusion of aid for the war-ravaged nation. Half of the funding provides military assistance.\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nAs the end drew near at the steel plant, wives of fighters who had held out told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, the wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she shared the words her husband wrote her on Thursday: \"Hello.

(AP)\n\nRussia's claimed seizure of a Mariupol steel plant that became a symbol of Ukrainian tenacity gives Russian President Vladimir Putin a badly wanted victory in the war he began, capping a nearly three-month siege that left a city in ruins and more than 20,000 residents feared dead.\n\nAfter the Russian Defense Ministry announced late Friday that its forces had removed the last Ukrainian fighters from the plant's miles of underground tunnels, concern mounted for the Ukrainian defenders who now are prisoners in Russian hands.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the head of an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, said Saturday that the Ukrainians, considered heroes by their fellow citizens, were sure to face a tribunal for their wartime actions.\n\n\"I believe that a tribunal is inevitable here. I believe that justice must be restored. There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency Tass quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly have tried to characterize the fighters who holed up in the Azovstal steel plant as neo-Nazis. Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance, and with it completing Moscow's long-sought goal of controlling the city, home to a strategic seaport.\n\nUkraine's military this week told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe end of the battle for Mariupol would help Putin offset some stinging setbacks, including the failure of Russian troops to take over Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, the sinking of the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea and the continued resistance that has stalled an offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe impact of Russia's declared victory on the broader war in Ukraine remained unclear.

The Russia-backed separatists have controlled parts of the Donbas region since 2014, and Moscow wants to expand the territory under its control.\n\nThe seizure of Mariupol furthers Russia's quest to essentially create a land bridge from Russia stretching through the Donbas region to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Saturday that Russia was working to restore the port and remove mines.\n\nUkraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, demanded anew that Russia pay \"in one way or another for everything it has destroyed in Ukraine. Every burned house. Every ruined school, ruined hospital. Each blown up house of culture and infrastructure facility. Every destroyed enterprise.\"\n\n\"Of course, the Russian state will not even recognize that it is an aggressor,\" he said in an address late Friday. \"But its recognition is not required.\"\n\nZelenskyy expressed gratitude to his US counterpart, Joe Biden, who signed off Saturday on a fresh, $40 billion infusion of aid for the war-ravaged nation. Half of the funding provides military assistance.\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nAs the end drew near at the steel plant, wives of fighters who had held out told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, the wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she shared the words her husband wrote her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nThe seaside steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been a battleground for weeks.

The Azovstal steel plant became a symbol of Ukrainian tenacity, and its seizure delivers Russian President Vladimir Putin a badly wanted victory in the war he began in February.\n\nRelated Biden signs $40 billion military, humanitarian aid bill for Ukraine\n\nFamily members of the steel mill fighters, who authorities say came from a variety of military and law enforcement units, have pleaded for them to be given rights as prisoners of war and eventually returned to Ukraine.

Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast its invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nUkraine's military had told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out.

The city is critical to Russia's objective of capturing all of eastern Ukraine and saw fierce fighting last month after Moscow's troops backed off from Kyiv.\n\nUkraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said he would not launch a counterattack into Russian territory but emphasized that the Donbas region remains sovereign to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking at a joint media conference with Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa, Zelenskyy said his forces were fighting to \"liberate our territory\" and the price of \"tens or hundreds of thousands of lives\" was too high to surrender it. He pressed Western countries for multiple launch rocket systems, which he said \"just stand still\" in other countries yet are \"key\" to Ukraine's success.\n\nPresident Biden signed off Saturday on a fresh, $40 billion infusion of aid for Ukraine, with half for military assistance. Portugal pledged up to 250 million euros, as well as continued shipments of military equipment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZelenskyy reiterated his intention to apply for European Union membership and accused Russia of blockading agricultural exports from Ukraine, which is known as the \"breadbasket of Europe.\"\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nThe seaside steelworks, occupying some 4 square miles, was a battleground for weeks. Drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, the dwindling group of outgunned Ukrainian fighters held out with the help of airdrops.\n\nZelensky revealed in an interview published Friday that Ukrainian helicopter pilots braved Russian anti-aircraft fire to ferry in medicine, food and water to the steel mill as well as to retrieve bodies and rescue wounded fighters.\n\nA \"very large\" number of the pilots died on the missions, he said. \"They are absolutely heroic people, who knew that it would be difficult, knew that to fly would be almost impossible,\" Zelensky said.\n\nRussia claimed that the Azov Regiment's commander was taken from the plant in an armored vehicle because of residents' alleged hatred for him, but no evidence of Ukrainian antipathy toward the nationalist regiment has emerged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry on Saturday released video of Russian troops taking into custody Serhiy Volynskyy, the commander of the Ukrainian Navy's 36th Special Marine Brigade, which was one of the main forces defending the steel plant. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify the date, location and conditions of the video.\n\nWith Russia controlling the city, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in Mariupol, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theater where hundreds of civilians had taken cover.

Others were said to be hospitalized.\n\nThe defense of the steel mill had been led by Ukraine's Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast its invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 4 square miles, had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defense and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nIn other developments Friday, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine and fighting raged in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday the evacuation of his forces from the miles of tunnels and bunkers beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\n\"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\n-- Russian lawmakers proposed a bill to lift the age limit of 40 for Russians volunteering for military service.

The village formerly occupied by Russian forces is back under Ukrainian control, albeit very close to the front line and under constant shelling.\n\nBy ELENA BECATOROS, OLEKSANDR STASHEVSKYI and CIARAN McQUILLAN - Associated Press\n\nPOKROVSK, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia claimed to have captured Mariupol on Friday in what would be its biggest victory yet in its war with Ukraine, after a nearly three-month siege that reduced much of the strategic port city to a smoking ruin, with over 20,000 civilians feared dead.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin the \"complete liberation\" of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol -- the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance -- and the city as a whole, spokesman Igor Konashenkov said.\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine.\n\nRussia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the ministry as saying a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters who had been holed up at the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday.\n\nAs they surrendered, the troops were taken prisoner by the Russians, and at least some were taken to a former penal colony. Others were said to be hospitalized.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nThe defense of the steel mill had been led by Ukraine's Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast its invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defense and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nIn other developments Friday, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine and fighting raged in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday the evacuation of his forces from the miles of tunnels and bunkers beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\n\"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\n-- Russian lawmakers proposed a bill to lift the age limit of 40 for Russians volunteering for military service. Currently, all Russian men 18 to 27 must undergo a year of service, though many get college deferments and other exemptions.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported Friday in the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking expanse of coal mines and factories.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces shelled the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway from multiple directions, taking aim at the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region,\" he said via email.\n\nMoscow's troops have also been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas, and at least 12 people were killed there on Friday, Haidai said.

His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

I believe that justice must be restored. There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency Tass quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly have tried to characterize the fighters who holed up in the Azovstal steel plant as neo-Nazis. Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance, and with it completing Moscow's long-sought goal of controlling the city, home to a strategic seaport.\n\nUkraine's military this week told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe end of the battle for Mariupol would help Putin offset some stinging setbacks, including the failure of Russian troops to take over Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, the sinking of the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea and the continued resistance that has stalled an offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe impact of Russia's declared victory on the broader war in Ukraine remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict, which began with the Russian invasion of its neighbour on Feb. 24.\n\nRussian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base in Black Sea region of Odesa as well as significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn its morning operational report, the Ukrainian military general staff reported heavy fighting in much of eastern Ukraine, including the areas of Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nSince failing to capture Kyiv, Russia focused its offensive in the country's eastern industrial heartland. The Russia-backed separatists have controlled parts of the Donbas region since 2014, and Moscow wants to expand the territory under its control.\n\nTaking Mariupol furthers Russia's quest to essentially create a land bridge from Russia via much of the Donbas area bordering Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nUkraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, expressed gratitude to his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, who signed off Saturday on a fresh, $40 billion infusion of aid for the war-ravaged nation. Half of the funding provides military assistance.\n\nZelenskyy, in remarks to the traumatized nation late Friday, demanded anew that Russia pay \"in one way or another for everything it has destroyed in Ukraine. Every burned house. Every ruined school, ruined hospital. Each blown up house of culture and infrastructure facility. Every destroyed enterprise.\"\n\n\"Of course, the Russian state will not even recognize that it is an aggressor,\" he continued. \"But its recognition is not required.\"\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nAs the end drew near at the steel plant, wives of fighters who had held out told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, the wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she shared the words her husband wrote her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nThe seaside steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometres, had been a battleground for weeks. Drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, the dwindling group of outgunned fighters held out with the help of air drops before their government ordered them to abandon the plant.\n\nZelenskyy revealed in an interview published Friday that Ukrainian helicopter pilots braved Russian anti-aircraft fire to ferry in medicine, food and water to the steel mill as well as to retrieve bodies and rescue wounded fighters.\n\nA \"very large\" number of the pilots died on their daring missions, he said. \"They are absolutely heroic people, who knew that it would be difficult, knew that to fly would be almost impossible,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nRussia claimed that the Azov Regiment's commander was taken away from the plant in an armoured vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred for him, but no evidence of Ukrainian antipathy toward the nationalist regiment has emerged.\n\nThe Kremlin has seized on the regiment's far-right origins in its drive to to cast the invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Russian authorities have threatened to put some of the steel mill's defenders on trial for alleged war crimes and put them on trial.\n\nWith Russia controlling the city, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in Mariupol, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theatre where hundreds of civilians had taken cover.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAt one point in the siege, Pope Francis lamented that Mariupol had become a \"city of martyrs.\"\n\nAn estimated 100,000 of the 450,000 people who resided there before the war remain. Many, trapped by Russia's siege, were left without food, water and electricity.\n\nThe chief executive of Metinvest, a multinational company which owns the Azovstal plant and another steel mill, Ilyich, in Mariupol, spoke of the city's devastation in an interview published Saturday in Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to clean it (the city) up to hide their crimes,'' the newspaper quoted Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov as saying. \"The inhabitants are trying to make the city function, to make water supplies work again.\"\n\n\"But the sewer system is damaged, there has been flooding, and infections are feared\" from drinking the water, he said.\n\nThe Ilyich steelworks still has some intact infrastructure, but if the Russians try to get it running, Ukrainians will refuse to return to their jobs there, Ryzhenkov said.\n\n\"We will never work under Russian occupation,'' Ryzhenkov said.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.castanet.net/content/2022/5/2022052110054-6288f1c479dce16d6a2bd51fjpeg_p3594131.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 21, "stanza_neu": 37, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 58, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7048930655", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "21:16:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T21:16:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T21:16:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7372549176216125, "url": "https://gazette.com/ap/international/russia-claims-to-have-taken-full-control-of-mariupol/article_04c1a8c4-2688-582d-abe4-c32bb4199cb4.html", "title": "Russia claims to have taken full control of Mariupol", "body": "POKROVSK, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia claimed to have captured Mariupol on Friday in what would be its biggest victory yet in its war with Ukraine, after a nearly three-month siege that reduced much of the strategic port city to a smoking ruin, with over 20,000 civilians feared dead.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin the \"complete liberation\" of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol -- the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance -- and the city as a whole, spokesman Igor Konashenkov said.\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine.\n\nRussia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the ministry as saying a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters who had been holed up at the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday.\n\nAs they surrendered, the troops were taken prisoner by the Russians, and at least some were taken to a former penal colony.

"body": "By ELENA BECATOROS, OLEKSANDR STASHEVSKYI and CIARAN McQUILLAN\n\nPOKROVSK, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia claimed to have captured Mariupol on Friday in what would be its biggest victory yet in its war with Ukraine, after a nearly three-month siege that reduced much of the strategic port city to a smoking ruin, with over 20,000 civilians feared dead.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin the \"complete liberation\" of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol -- the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance -- and the city as a whole, spokesman Igor Konashenkov said.\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine.\n\nRussia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the ministry as saying a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters who had been holed up at the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday.\n\nAs they surrendered, the troops were taken prisoner by the Russians, and at least some were taken to a former penal colony. Others were said to be hospitalized.\n\nThe defense of the steel mill had been led by Ukraine's Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast its invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defense and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nIn other developments Friday, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine and fighting raged in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday the evacuation of his forces from the miles of tunnels and bunkers beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- Zelenskyy said Russia should be made to pay for every home, school, hospital and business it destroys. He called on Ukraine's partners to seize Russian funds and property under their jurisdiction and use them to create a fund to compensate those who suffered.\n\nRussia \"would feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every shell that it has fired at us,\" he said in his nightly video address.\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\n-- Russian lawmakers proposed a bill to lift the age limit of 40 for Russians volunteering for military service. Currently, all Russian men 18 to 27 must undergo a year of service, though many get college deferments and other exemptions.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported Friday in the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking expanse of coal mines and factories.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces shelled the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway from multiple directions, taking aim at the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region,\" he said via email.\n\nMoscow's troops have also been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas, and at least 12 people were killed there on Friday, Haidai said. A school that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, was hit, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nBut he said the Russians took losses in the attack on Severodonetsk and were forced to retreat. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\n___\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

port city to a smoking ruin, with over 20,000 civilians feared dead.\n\nDefence minister Sergei Shoigu reported to president Vladimir Putin the \"complete liberation\" of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol -- the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance in the city -- spokesman Igor Konashenkov said.\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine.\n\nRussia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the ministry as saying a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters who had been holed up at the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday.\n\nAs they surrendered, the troops were taken prisoner by the Russians, and at least some were taken to a former penal colony. Others were said to be hospitalised.\n\nThe defence of the steelworks had been led by Ukraine's Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast its invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defence and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Mr Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on 24 February -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nIn other developments Friday, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine and fighting raged in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on 9 March, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday the evacuation of his forces from the miles of tunnels and bunkers beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Mr Zelensky, described the defence of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 BC before finally succumbing.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- Mr Zelensky said Russia should be made to pay for every home, school, hospital and business it destroys. He called on Ukraine's partners to seize Russian funds and property under their jurisdiction and use them to create a fund to compensate those who suffered.\n\nRussia \"would feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every shell that it has fired at us,\" he said in his nightly video address.\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\n-- Russian lawmakers proposed a bill to lift the age limit of 40 for Russians volunteering for military service. Currently, all Russian men 18 to 27 must undergo a year of service, though many get college deferments and other exemptions.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported Friday in the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking expanse of coal mines and factories.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces shelled the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway from multiple directions, taking aim at the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region,\" he said via email.\n\nMoscow's troops have also been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas, and at least 12 people were killed there on Friday, Haidai said. A school that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, was hit, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nBut he said the Russians took losses in the attack on Severodonetsk and were forced to retreat. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/05/21/05/Ukraine_Russia_Mariupol_49061.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 22, "stanza_neu": 40, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 62, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049131243", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "03:26:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T03:26:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T03:24:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "url": "https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/russia-claims-to-have-taken-full-control-of-mariupol/2532887/", "title": "Russia claims to have taken full control of Mariupol", "body": "a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters who had been holed up at the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday.

Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin the \"complete liberation\" of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol -- the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance -- and the city as a whole, spokesman Igor Konashenkov said.

That has stirred international fears about their fate. The steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometers, had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defense and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on February 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nIn other developments Friday, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine and fighting raged in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing. Russian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday the evacuation of his forces from the miles of tunnels and bunkers beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive. As the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\" Natalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\" She said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 BC before finally succumbing.", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Mariupol-Reuters-Photo.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 15, "stanza_neu": 26, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 41, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7050076655", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-22", "time": "03:36:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-22T03:36:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-22T03:34:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "url": "https://www.firstpost.com/world/ukraine-conflict-russias-claim-of-mariupols-capture-fuels-concern-for-prisoners-of-war-10703561.html", "title": "Ukraine Conflict: Russia's claim of Mariupol's capture fuels concern for prisoners of war", "body": "Pokrovsk, Ukraine: Concern mounted on 21 May over Ukrainian fighters who became prisoners at the end of Russia's brutal three-month siege of Mariupol, as a Moscow-backed separatist leader vowed they would face tribunals.\n\nRussia claimed full control of the Azovstal steel plant, which for weeks was the last holdout in Mariupol and a symbol of Ukrainian tenacity in the strategic port city, now in ruins with more than 20,000 residents feared dead.

its forces had removed the last Ukrainian fighters from the plant's miles of underground tunnels, concern mounted for the Ukrainian defenders who now are prisoners in Russian hands.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the head of an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, said Saturday that the Ukrainians considered heroes by their fellow citizens were sure to face a tribunal for their wartime actions.\n\n\"I believe that a tribunal is inevitable here. I believe that justice must be restored. There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency Tass quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly have tried to characterize the fighters who holed up in the Azovstal steel plant as neo-Nazis. Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance, and with it completing Moscow's long-sought goal of controlling the city, home to a strategic seaport.\n\nUkraine's military this week told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe impact of Russia's declared victory on the broader war in Ukraine remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict, which began with the Russian invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base in Black Sea region of Odesa as well as significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn its morning operational report, the Ukrainian military general staff reported heavy fighting in much of eastern Ukraine, including the areas of Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nSince failing to reach and capture Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Russia focused its offensive in the country's eastern industrial heartland. The Russia-backed separatists have controlled parts of the Donbas region since 2014, and Moscow wants to expand the territory under its control.\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockkaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nAs the end drew near at the steel plant, wives of fighters who had held out told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, the wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she shared the words her husband wrote her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nThe wife of another fighter, Natalia Zaritskaya, said her husband reported earlier this week that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived and most were seriously wounded.\n\n\"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly,\" Zaritskaya said.\n\nThe seasize steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been a battleground for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters held out with the help of air drops of supplies, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant and save themselves.\n\nRussia said the Azov Regiment's commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred for him.\n\nNo evidence of Ukrainian antipathy toward the nationalist regiment has emerged. The Kremlin has seized on the regiment's far-right origins in its drive to to cast the invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial.\n\nCapturing Mariupol furthers Russia's quest to essentially create a land bridge from Russia via much of the Donbas area bordering Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe city's seizure also helps Russian leader Putin offset some stinging setbacks, including the failure to take over Kyiv, the sinking of the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea and continued resistance that has stalled the offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nWith Mariupol under Russian control, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in the city, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theater where civilians had taken cover.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAt one point in the siege, Pope Francis lamented that Mariupol had become a \"city of martyrs.\"\n\nAn estimated 100,000 of the 450,000 people who resided there before the war remain. Many, trapped by Russia's siege, were left without food, water and electricity.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the steel plant during humanitarian cease-fires. They spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nThe chief executive of Metinvest, a multinational company which owns the Azovstal plant and another steel mill, Ilyich, in Mariupol, spoke of the city's devastation in an interview published Saturday in Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to clean it (the city) up to hide their crimes,'' the newspaper quoted Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov as saying. \"The inhabitants are trying to make the city function, to make water supplies work again.\"\n\n\"But the sewer system is damaged, there has been flooding, and infections are feared\" from drinking the water, he said.\n\nThe Ilyich steelworks still has some intact infrastructure, but if the Russians try to get it running, Ukrainians will refuse to return to their jobs there, Ryzhenkov said.\n\n\"We will never work under Russian occupation,'' Ryzhenkov said.\n\n-- -- --\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\nALSO READ: Experts warn arms for Ukraine could end up in wrong hands\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- Zelenskyy said Russia should be made to pay for every home, school, hospital and business it destroys. He called on Ukraine's partners to seize Russian funds and property under their jurisdiction and use them to create a fund to compensate those who suffered.\n\nRussia \"would feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every shell that it has fired at us,\" he said in his nightly video address.\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect.

A school that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, was hit, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nBut he said the Russians took losses in the attack on Severodonetsk and were forced to retreat.

We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you.

Follow the latest updates here.\n\nRussia claimed to have captured Mariupol in what would be its biggest victory yet in its war with Ukraine, after a nearly three-month siege that reduced much of the strategic port city to a smoking ruin, with over 20,000 civilians feared dead.\n\nRussian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin the \"complete liberation\" of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol -- the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance -- and the city as a whole, spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. There was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine.\n\nRussia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the ministry as saying a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters who had been holed up at the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday. As they surrendered, the troops were taken prisoner by the Russians, and at least some were taken to a former penal colony. Others were said to be hospitalised.\n\nThe defense of the steel mill had been led by Ukraine's Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast its invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armoured vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals.

The seizure gives Russian President Vladimir Putin a badly wanted victory in the war he began nearly three months ago.\n\nAs the West rallies behind Ukraine, Polish President Andrzej Duda arrived in Ukraine on an unannounced visit and will address the country's parliament on Sunday, his office said.\n\nPoland, which has welcomed millions of Ukrainian refugees since the start of the war, is a strong supporter of Ukraine's desire to join the European Union. With Russia blocking Ukraine's sea ports, Poland has become a major gateway for Western humanitarian aid and weapons going into Ukraine and has been helping Ukraine get its grain and other agricultural products to world markets.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry released video of Ukrainian soldiers being detained after announcing that its forces had removed the last holdouts from the Mariupol plant's extensive underground tunnels. It said a total of 2,439 had surrendered.\n\nFamily members of the fighters, who came from a variety of military and law enforcement units, have pleaded for them to be given rights as prisoners of war and eventually returned to Ukraine. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Saturday that Ukraine \"will fight for the return\" of every one of them.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the pro-Kremlin head of an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, said the captured fighters included some foreign nationals, though he did not provide details. He said they were sure to face a tribunal. Russian officials and state media have sought to characterize the fighters as neo-Nazis and criminals.\n\n\"I believe that justice must be restored. There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency Tass quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nAmong the defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of its effort to cast the invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine.\n\nA prominent member of Russia's parliament, Leonid Slutsky, said Moscow was studying the possibility of exchanging the Azovstal fighters for Viktor Medvedchuk, a wealthy Ukrainian with close ties to Putin who faces criminal charges in Ukraine, the Russian news agency Interfax reported. Slutsky later walked back those remarks, saying he agreed with Pushilin that their fate should be decided by a tribunal.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal. Ukraine's military had told the fighters their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe capture of Mariupol furthers Russia's quest to create a land bridge from Russia stretching through the Donbas region to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe impact on the broader war remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base near Odesa, Ukraine's main Black Sea port, as well as a significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nThe Ukrainian military reported heavy fighting in much of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"The situation in Donbas is extremely difficult,\" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. \"As in previous days, the Russian army is trying to attack Sloviansk and Sievierodonetsk.\" He said Ukrainian forces are holding off the offensive \"every day.\"\n\nSievierodonetsk is the main city under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk region, which together with the Donetsk region makes up the Donbas. Gov. Serhii Haidai said the only functioning hospital in the city has just three doctors and supplies for 10 days.\n\nOn Sunday, the British Ministry of Defense said Russia's only operational company of BMP-T Terminator tank support vehicles, which are designed to protect main battle tanks, \"has likely been deployed to the Sievierodonetsk axis of the Donbas offensive.\" It said, however, with a maximum of 10 of the vehicles deployed, \"they are unlikely to have a significant impact on the campaign.\"\n\nSloviansk, in the Donetsk region, is critical to Russia's objective of capturing all of eastern Ukraine and saw fierce fighting last month after Moscow's troops backed off from Kyiv. Russian shelling on Saturday killed seven civilians and injured 10 more elsewhere in the region, the governor said.\n\nA monastery in the Donetsk region village of Bohorodichne was evacuated after being hit by a Russian airstrike, the regional police said Saturday. About 100 monks, nuns and children had been seeking safe shelter in the basement of the church and no one was hurt, the police said in a Facebook post, which included a video showing extensive damage to the monastery as well as nuns, monks and children boarding vans on Friday for the evacuation.\n\nZelenskyy on Saturday emphasized that the Donbas remains part of Ukraine and his forces were fighting to liberate it.\n\nSpeaking at a joint news conference with Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa, he pressed Western countries for multiple-launch rocket systems, which he said \"just stand still\" in other countries yet are key to Ukraine's success.\n\nPortugal and Poland, where Costa stopped for talks before traveling on to Kyiv, support bringing Ukraine into the European Union quickly, even if some other EU members balk at granting it speedy access.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden signed off Saturday on a fresh, $40 billion infusion of aid for Ukraine, with half for military assistance. Portugal pledged up to 250 million euros, as well as continued shipments of military equipment.\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nThe seaside steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), were a battleground for weeks. Drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, the dwindling group of outgunned Ukrainian fighters held out with the help of airdrops that Zelenskyy said cost the lives of many \"absolutely heroic\" helicopter pilots.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry on Saturday released video of Russian troops taking into custody Serhiy Volynskyy, the commander of the Ukrainian Navy's 36th Special Marine Brigade, which was one of the main forces defending the steel plant. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify the date, location and conditions of the video.\n\nWith Russia controlling the city, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in Mariupol, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theater where hundreds of civilians had taken cover. Satellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 of the 450,000 people who resided in Mariupol before the war remain. Many, trapped by Russia's siege, were left without food, water and electricity.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol warned Saturday the city is facing a health and sanitation \"catastrophe\" from mass burials in shallow pits across the ruined city as well as the breakdown of sewage systems. Vadim Boychenko said summer rains threaten to contaminate water sources as he pressed Russian forces to allow residents to safely leave the city.\n\n\"In addition to the humanitarian catastrophe created by the (Russian) occupiers and collaborators, the city is on the verge of an outbreak of infectious diseases,\" he said on the messaging app Telegram.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

Others were said to be hospitalized.\n\nThe defense of the steel mill had been led by Ukraine's Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast its invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defense and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nIn other developments Friday, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine and fighting raged in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday the evacuation of his forces from the miles of tunnels and bunkers beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello.

He called on Ukraine's partners to seize Russian funds and property under their jurisdiction and use them to create a fund to compensate those who suffered.\n\nRussia \"would feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every shell that it has fired at us,\" he said in his nightly video address.\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial.

Currently, all Russian men 18 to 27 must undergo a year of service, though many get college deferments and other exemptions.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported Friday in the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking expanse of coal mines and factories.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces shelled the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway from multiple directions, taking aim at the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region,\" he said via email.\n\nMoscow's troops have also been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas, and at least 12 people were killed there on Friday, Haidai said. A school that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, was hit, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nBut he said the Russians took losses in the attack on Severodonetsk and were forced to retreat. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

Others were said to be hospitalized.\n\nThe defense of the steel mill had been led by Ukraine's Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast its invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defense and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nIn other developments Friday, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine and fighting raged in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday the evacuation of his forces from the miles of tunnels and bunkers beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nNewsletters\n\nSuccess! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup.\n\nError!

They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- Zelenskyy said Russia should be made to pay for every home, school, hospital and business it destroys. He called on Ukraine's partners to seize Russian funds and property under their jurisdiction and use them to create a fund to compensate those who suffered.\n\nRussia \"would feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every shell that it has fired at us,\" he said in his nightly video address.\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\n-- Russian lawmakers proposed a bill to lift the age limit of 40 for Russians volunteering for military service. Currently, all Russian men 18 to 27 must undergo a year of service, though many get college deferments and other exemptions.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported Friday in the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking expanse of coal mines and factories.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces shelled the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway from multiple directions, taking aim at the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region,\" he said via email.\n\nMoscow's troops have also been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas, and at least 12 people were killed there on Friday, Haidai said. A school that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, was hit, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nBut he said the Russians took losses in the attack on Severodonetsk and were forced to retreat. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

He said they were sure to face a tribunal. Russian officials and state media have sought to characterize the fighters as neo-Nazis and criminals.\n\n\"I believe that justice must be restored. There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency Tass quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nAmong the defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of its effort to cast the invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine.\n\nA prominent member of Russia's parliament, Leonid Slutsky, said Moscow was studying the possibility of exchanging the Azovstal fighters for Viktor Medvedchuk, a wealthy Ukrainian with close ties to Putin who faces criminal charges in Ukraine, the Russian news agency Interfax reported. Slutsky later walked back those remarks, saying he agreed with Pushilin that their fate should be decided by a tribunal.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal. Ukraine's military had told the fighters their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe capture of Mariupol furthers Russia's quest to create a land bridge from Russia stretching through the Donbas region to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe impact on the broader war remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base near Odesa, Ukraine's main Black Sea port, as well as a significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nThe Ukrainian military reported heavy fighting in much of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"The situation in Donbas is extremely difficult,\" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. \"As in previous days, the Russian army is trying to attack Sloviansk and Sievierodonetsk.\" He said Ukrainian forces are holding off the offensive \"every day.\"\n\nSievierodonetsk is the main city under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk region, which together with the Donetsk region makes up the Donbas. Gov. Serhii Haidai said the only functioning hospital in the city has just three doctors and supplies for 10 days.\n\nSloviansk, in the Donetsk region, is critical to Russia's objective of capturing all of eastern Ukraine and saw fierce fighting last month after Moscow's troops backed off from Kyiv. Russian shelling on Saturday killed seven civilians and injured 10 more elsewhere in the region, the governor said.\n\nA monastery in the Donetsk region village of Bohorodichne was evacuated after being hit by a Russian airstrike, the regional police said Saturday. About 100 monks, nuns and children had been seeking safe shelter in the basement of the church and no one was hurt, the police said in a Facebook post, which included a video showing extensive damage to the monastery as well as nuns, monks and children boarding vans on Friday for the evacuation.\n\nZelenskyy on Saturday emphasized that the Donbas remains part of Ukraine and his forces were fighting to liberate it.\n\nSpeaking at a joint news conference with Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa, he pressed Western countries for multiple-launch rocket systems, which he said \"just stand still\" in other countries yet are key to Ukraine's success.\n\nPortugal and Poland, where Costa stopped for talks before traveling on to Kyiv, support bringing Ukraine into the European Union quickly, even if some other EU members balk at granting it speedy access.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden signed off Saturday on a fresh, $40 billion infusion of aid for Ukraine, with half for military assistance. Portugal pledged up to 250 million euros, as well as continued shipments of military equipment.\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nThe seaside steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), were a battleground for weeks. Drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, the dwindling group of outgunned Ukrainian fighters held out with the help of airdrops that Zelenskyy said cost the lives of many \"absolutely heroic\" helicopter pilots.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry on Saturday released video of Russian troops taking into custody Serhiy Volynskyy, the commander of the Ukrainian Navy's 36th Special Marine Brigade, which was one of the main forces defending the steel plant. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify the date, location and conditions of the video.\n\nWith Russia controlling the city, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in Mariupol, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theater where hundreds of civilians had taken cover. Satellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 of the 450,000 people who resided in Mariupol before the war remain. Many, trapped by Russia's siege, were left without food, water and electricity.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol warned Saturday the city is facing a health and sanitation \"catastrophe\" from mass burials in shallow pits across the ruined city as well as the breakdown of sewage systems. Vadim Boychenko said summer rains threaten to contaminate water sources as he pressed Russian forces to allow residents to safely leave the city.\n\n\"In addition to the humanitarian catastrophe created by the (Russian) occupiers and collaborators, the city is on the verge of an outbreak of infectious diseases,\" he said on the messaging app Telegram.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-91719480,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-67932,overlay-etdefence/photo.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 44, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 55, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049318616", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "08:05:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T08:05:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T08:05:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "url": "https://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2022/05/21/In-biggest-capture-yet-Russia-claims-victory-in-Mariupol", "title": "In biggest capture yet, Russia claims victory in Mariupol  | Al Arabiya English", "body": "In what would be its biggest victory yet in the war with Ukraine, Russia claimed to have captured Mariupol after a nearly three-month siege that reduced much of the strategic port city to a smoking ruin, with over 20,000 civilians feared dead.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin the \"complete liberation\" of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol -- the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance -- and the city as a whole, spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Friday.\n\nFor all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine.\n\nRussia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the ministry as saying a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters who had been holed up at the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday.\n\nAs they surrendered, the troops were taken prisoner by the Russians, and at least some were taken to a former penal colony.

Much of Mariupol has been reduced to rubble, and more than 20,000 civilians are feared dead.\n\nUkrainian fighters hiding out in the city's steelworks plant engaged in heavy fighting with Russian forces for several weeks. Earlier this week, however, Ukrainian officials ordered the garrison to stand down to save the fighters' lives.\n\nThe evacuation of the last fighters from the Azovstal steel plant, their number unclear, follows the surrender of almost 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers in recent days, according to the Russian defense minister.\n\nThe commander of Ukraine's Azov Regiment, key to helping defend the plant, said efforts to remove the dead from the battle scene were also underway.\n\nBattle for the East\n\nIn other developments Friday, Russia stepped up its assault on eastern Ukraine, using artillery, rocket launchers and aircraft to pound the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk; destroying houses in residential districts; and killing civilians, according to Ukrainian civilian and military officials.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy described the conditions in the Donbas region, which includes Luhansk and Donetsk, as \"hell\" and said the region had been \"completely destroyed\" by Russia's invasion. He accused Russian forces of attempting to kill as many Ukrainians and do as much damage as possible.\n\nThe governor of Ukraine's Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said on Telegram that Russia attacked a school in the city of Severodonetsk on Friday. He said the school was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children.\n\nThe Donbas has been President Putin's focus since his troops failed to take the capital, Kyiv, in the early days of the war.\n\nRussia's defense minister said Friday, \"the liberation of the Luhansk People's Republic is nearing completion.\"\n\nRussian progress in the Donbas is slow and uneven and behind where Moscow wants it to be, said Pentagon spokesman John Kirby.

The House of Representatives voted in favor of the package last week.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden signed the measure Saturday.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy called the aid package \"a manifestation of strong leadership and a necessary contribution to our common defense of freedom.\"\n\nIn another development, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration is authorizing $100 million more in military aid to Ukraine. The package of aid includes 18 more howitzers and 18 vehicles to move them, as well as three counter-artillery radars, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.\n\nRussia has said it will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday.

Others were said to be hospitalized.\n\nThe defense of the steel mill had been led by Ukraine's Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast its invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defense and save themselves.\n\nAd\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nIn other developments Friday, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine, and fighting raged in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nAd\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nAd\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nAd\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- Zelenskyy said Russia should be made to pay for every home, school, hospital and business it destroys. He called on Ukraine's partners to seize Russian funds and property under their jurisdiction and use them to create a fund to compensate those who suffered.\n\nAd\n\nRussia \"would feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every shell that it has fired at us,\" he said in his nightly video address.\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\nAd\n\n-- Russian lawmakers proposed a bill to lift the age limit of 40 for Russians volunteering for military service. Currently, all Russian men 18 to 27 must undergo a year of service, though many get college deferments and other exemptions.\n\n___\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv. Stashevskyi reported from Kyiv.

He said Ukrainian forces were blocking the offensive on a daily basis.\n\nSievierodonetsk is the main Ukrainian-controlled city in the Luhansk region, which together with the Donetsk region constitute Donbas.

Withdrawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, the dwindling group of Ukrainian-occupied Ukrainian fighters faced the aid of air points that Zelenskyy said cost the lives of many absolutely heroic helicopter pilots.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry on Saturday released videos of Russian troops taking into custody Serhiy Volynskyy, commander of the 36th Special Naval Brigade of the Ukrainian Navy, which was one of the main forces defending the steel plant. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify the date, location and conditions of the video.\n\nWith Russia controlling the city, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in Mariupol, including the bombing of a maternity hospital and a theater where hundreds of civilians were hiding.

The seizure gives Russian President Vladimir Putin a badly wanted victory in the war he began nearly three months ago.\n\nAs the West rallies behind Ukraine, Polish President Andrzej Duda arrived in Ukraine on an unannounced visit and will address the country's parliament on Sunday, his office said.\n\nPoland, which has welcomed millions of Ukrainian refugees since the start of the war, is a strong supporter of Ukraine's desire to join the European Union. With Russia blocking Ukraine's sea ports, Poland has become a major gateway for Western humanitarian aid and weapons going into Ukraine and has been helping Ukraine get its grain and other agricultural products to world markets.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry released video of Ukrainian soldiers being detained after announcing that its forces had removed the last holdouts from the Mariupol plant's extensive underground tunnels. It said a total of 2,439 had surrendered.\n\nFamily members of the fighters, who came from a variety of military and law enforcement units, have pleaded for them to be given rights as prisoners of war and eventually returned to Ukraine. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Saturday that Ukraine \"will fight for the return\" of every one of them.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the pro-Kremlin head of an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, said the captured fighters included some foreign nationals, though he did not provide details. He said they were sure to face a tribunal. Russian officials and state media have sought to characterize the fighters as neo-Nazis and criminals.\n\n\"I believe that justice must be restored. There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency Tass quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nAmong the defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of its effort to cast the invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine.\n\nA prominent member of Russia's parliament, Leonid Slutsky, said Moscow was studying the possibility of exchanging the Azovstal fighters for Viktor Medvedchuk, a wealthy Ukrainian with close ties to Putin who faces criminal charges in Ukraine, the Russian news agency Interfax reported. Slutsky later walked back those remarks, saying he agreed with Pushilin that their fate should be decided by a tribunal.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal. Ukraine's military had told the fighters their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe capture of Mariupol furthers Russia's quest to create a land bridge from Russia stretching through the Donbas region to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe impact on the broader war remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base near Odesa, Ukraine's main Black Sea port, as well as a significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nThe Ukrainian military reported heavy fighting in much of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"The situation in Donbas is extremely difficult,\" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. \"As in previous days, the Russian army is trying to attack Sloviansk and Sievierodonetsk.\" He said Ukrainian forces are holding off the offensive \"every day.\"\n\nSievierodonetsk is the main city under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk region, which together with the Donetsk region makes up the Donbas. Gov. Serhii Haidai said the only functioning hospital in the city has just three doctors and supplies for 10 days.\n\nSloviansk, in the Donetsk region, is critical to Russia's objective of capturing all of eastern Ukraine and saw fierce fighting last month after Moscow's troops backed off from Kyiv. Russian shelling on Saturday killed seven civilians and injured 10 more elsewhere in the region, the governor said.\n\nA monastery in the Donetsk region village of Bohorodichne was evacuated after being hit by a Russian airstrike, the regional police said Saturday. About 100 monks, nuns and children had been seeking safe shelter in the basement of the church and no one was hurt, the police said in a Facebook post, which included a video showing extensive damage to the monastery as well as nuns, monks and children boarding vans on Friday for the evacuation.\n\nZelenskyy on Saturday emphasized that the Donbas remains part of Ukraine and his forces were fighting to liberate it.\n\nSpeaking at a joint news conference with Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa, he pressed Western countries for multiple-launch rocket systems, which he said \"just stand still\" in other countries yet are key to Ukraine's success.\n\nPortugal and Poland, where Costa stopped for talks before traveling on to Kyiv, support bringing Ukraine into the European Union quickly, even if some other EU members balk at granting it speedy access.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden signed off Saturday on a fresh, $40 billion infusion of aid for Ukraine, with half for military assistance. Portugal pledged up to 250 million euros, as well as continued shipments of military equipment.\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nThe seaside steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), were a battleground for weeks. Drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, the dwindling group of outgunned Ukrainian fighters held out with the help of airdrops that Zelenskyy said cost the lives of many \"absolutely heroic\" helicopter pilots.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry on Saturday released video of Russian troops taking into custody Serhiy Volynskyy, the commander of the Ukrainian Navy's 36th Special Marine Brigade, which was one of the main forces defending the steel plant. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify the date, location and conditions of the video.\n\nWith Russia controlling the city, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in Mariupol, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theater where hundreds of civilians had taken cover. Satellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 of the 450,000 people who resided in Mariupol before the war remain. Many, trapped by Russia's siege, were left without food, water and electricity.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol warned Saturday the city is facing a health and sanitation \"catastrophe\" from mass burials in shallow pits across the ruined city as well as the breakdown of sewage systems. Vadim Boychenko said summer rains threaten to contaminate water sources as he pressed Russian forces to allow residents to safely leave the city.\n\n\"In addition to the humanitarian catastrophe created by the (Russian) occupiers and collaborators, the city is on the verge of an outbreak of infectious diseases,\" he said on the messaging app Telegram.\n\n___\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out in the plant, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon its defense and save their lives.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed military victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lighting victory for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nStill, military analysts said the city's capture at this point holds more symbolic importance than anything else, since Mariupol was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the drawn-out fighting there have already left.\n\nIn other developments Friday, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine and fighting raged in the the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for control of the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nThe city endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained from a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left behind rows and rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place.\n\nA week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600. Officials had written the word \"CHILDREN\" in Russian on the pavement outside to try to forestall an aerial attack.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians. The imagery showed rows of graves stretching away from an existing cemetery.\n\nMariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko accused the Russians of \"hiding their military crimes\" in the mass graves and labeled it \"the new Babi Yar\" -- recalling the ravine in Kyiv where the Nazis massacred nearly 34,000 Ukrainian Jews during World War II.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Monday that the evacuation of his forces from the bunkers and tunnels beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\n\"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe Azovstal complex covers 11 square kilometers (4 square miles) and is threaded with about 24 kilometers (15 miles) of tunnels and bunkers. Earlier in May, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires.\n\nOne civilian evacuee from Azovstal, who made it to the Ukrainian controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on May 3, said she went to sleep at the plant every night afraid she wouldn't wake up.\n\n\"You can't imagine how scary it is when you sit in the bomb shelter, in a damp and wet basement, and it is bouncing and shaking,\" said Elina Tsybulchenko, 54.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks spoke emotionally about what may have been their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\n-- Russian lawmakers proposed a bill to lift the age limit of 40 for Russians volunteering for military service. Currently, all Russian men 18 to 27 must undergo a year of service, though many get college deferments and other exemptions.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported Friday in the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking expanse of coal mines and factories.\n\n\"The liberation of the Luhansk People's Republic is nearing completion,\" Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu declared, referring to the breakaway state proclaimed by pro-Moscow separatists in 2014 and recognized by the Kremlin.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces were especially focused on the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway, the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The road is extremely important because it's the only connection to other regions of the country,\" he said via email. \"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region.\"\n\nRussian forces shelled the road constantly from multiple directions, but Ukrainian armored transports were still able to get through, Haidai added.\n\nMoscow's troops have been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas. One of Friday's attacks was on a school in Severodonetsk that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, Haidai said. Three adults were killed, he said on Telegram.\n\nTwelve people were killed in Severodonetsk, Haidai said. It was not immediately clear if that included the three at the school. In addition, more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nRussian forces now control 90 percent of Luhansk, but the attack on Severodonetsk failed -- \"the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated,\" Haidai said. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\n___\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\nWAR ON TWO FRONTS\n\nOutside of Mariupol, the war continues on both the diplomatic front and the battlefront.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia should be made to pay for every home, school, hospital and business it destroys. He called on Ukraine's partners to seize Russian funds and property under their jurisdiction and use them to create a fund to compensate those who suffered.\n\nRussia \"would feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every shell that it has fired at us,\" he said in his nightly video address.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces shelled the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway from multiple directions, taking aim at the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region,\" he said via email.\n\nMoscow's troops have also been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas, and at least 12 people were killed there Friday, Haidai said. A school that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, was hit, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nBut he said the Russians took losses in the attack on Severodonetsk and were forced to retreat. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nIn Moscow, Putin said his country has faced a barrage of cyberattacks from the West amid the invasion of Ukraine but has successfully fended them off.\n\nSpeaking Friday to members of Russia's Security Council, Putin said \"the challenges in this area have become even more pressing, serious and extensive.\" He charged that \"an outright aggression has been unleashed against Russia, a war has been waged in the information space.\"\n\nPutin added that \"the cyber-aggression against us, the same as the attack on Russia by sanctions in general, has failed.\"\n\nHe ordered officials to \"perfect and enhance the mechanisms of ensuring information security at critically important industrial facilities which have a direct bearing on our country's defensive capability, and the stable development of the economic and social spheres.\"\n\nGERMANY PROVIDES AID\n\nElswhere, Germany's finance minister says the Group of Seven leading economies and global financial institutions are providing $19.8 billion in aid to bolster Ukraine's public finances.\n\nFinance Minister Christian Lindner told reporters Friday that $9.5 billion of the total was mobilized at meetings of the G-7 finance ministers in Koenigswinter, Germany, this week.\n\nHe said the goal is to ensure that Ukraine's financial situation does not affect its ability to defend itself against Russia's invasion.\n\n\"We agreed on concrete actions to deepen multilateral economic cooperation and underlined our commitment to our united response to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and to our unwavering support to Ukraine,\" a G-7 statement said.\n\n$40B FROM U.S.\n\nIn the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\nZelenskyy thanked the United States for the $40 billion aid package, which got final congressional approval Thursday.\n\n\"This is a demonstration of strong leadership and a necessary contribution to our common defense of freedom,\" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation.\n\nHe also thanked the European Union for its support.\n\n\"And for our partners this is not just an expense or a gift. This is their contribution to security,\" Zelenskyy said. \"For defending Ukraine also defends them from new wars and crises that Russia could provoke if it is successful in the war against Ukraine. Therefore, we must together ensure that Russia's aggression against our state has no success, not militarily, economically or any other.\"\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine's monthly budget deficit is $5 billion \"and so to survive in the war for freedom, we need quick and sufficient financial support.\"\n\nThe U.S. has announced a shipment of $100 million in military equipment to Ukraine, separate from what will be coming from the $40 billion approved by Congress. The latest package includes 18 more howitzers as well as anti-artillery radar systems, both of which the U.S. has provided to Ukraine already since Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Anton Troianovski of The New York Times and Elena Becatoros, Oleksandr Stashevskyi, Ciaran McQuillan, Yuras Karmanau, Andrea Rosa, Jamey Keaten and staff members of The Associated Press.\n\nUkrainian servicemen, riding in a bus Friday after leaving Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant, near a penal colony in Olyonivka, in territory under the government of the Donetsk People's Republic.

Most of the city's pre-war 400,000 population has fled in recent weeks.\n\nYesterday, Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin that the Azovstal plant and the whole of Mariupol were \"completely liberated.\"\n\nRussia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the Russian Defense Ministry as saying that as of May 16, a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters who had been blocked at Azovstal had laid down their arms, including 531 yesterday, who according to Moscow, were the last defenders of the plant.\n\n\"The territory of the Azovstal metallurgical plant has been completely liberated,\" the Russian Defense Ministry said. \"The underground facilities of the plant where the Ukrainian fighters were hiding are now under the full control of the Russian armed forces.\"\n\nThe ministry released a video that allegedly shows the surrender of Ukrainians. On it, unarmed men approached a line of Russian soldiers in front of the plant and announce their names. The Russians then carefully searched each of them and their belongings and asked the defenders to show off their tattoos.\n\nSo far, there is no confirmation from Ukraine that Mariupol has fallen.\n\nThe fall of the city would mean Russia's biggest victory since the start of the war.\n\nRussian attacks on the city began shortly after the conflict broke out.\n\nAs Russian troops gradually gained control of the strategic city near the Sea of Azov through constant bombing and blockades, the last defenders of Mariupol took refuge in Azovstal, which has an underground network of bunkers and tunnels. They did not have enough water, food, medicine and ammunition.\n\nEarlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a statement tantamount to admitting defeat. He announced that the two-month battle for the last remaining unconquered part of Azovstal was over, paving the way for the capture of Ukrainian troops by the Russians.\n\nThe first 264 of them surrendered on Monday, including more than 50 seriously injured. According to Russia, more were captured on Thursday, but commanders and some other fighters continued to defend their positions.\n\nYesterday, however, the remaining Ukrainian defenders at the plant decided that there was no point in continuing to fight, according to a video message from Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment of the National Guard of Ukraine.\n\n\"The army command has ordered the defense of the city to be suspended,\" Prokopenko said, adding that the decision was made to protect the lives and health of soldiers.\n\nYesterday, hours before Russia announced full control of the city, Zelensky said defenders had been told by the Ukrainian army to come out and save their lives.\n\nAccording to him, the Ukrainian Air Force tried to provide air supply to Mariupol but was repulsed, suffering heavy losses.\n\n\"Unfortunately, a large number of our pilots died,\" Zelensky said on Ukrainian television. \"These were heroes in the full sense of the word, who knew it was hard, that it was almost impossible to fly there, to transport food, water and medicine by air to Azovstal, and to return the wounded and the bodies of the dead.\"\n\nUkrainian Interior Minister Anton Gerashchenko said the plant's defense would be studied in military schools for years to come. People inside did not have fresh water and had only one meal a day, he said.\n\nThe Kremlin has not said what comes next for the captives. Kyiv has offered to exchange them for Russians in Ukrainian captivity, although some in Moscow have called for them to be treated as criminals and tried.\n\nMoscow considers the Azov Regiment \"Nazis\". The unit, which was formed in 2014 as a militia to fight pro-Russian separatists, denies being fascist, and Ukraine says it has reformed its original radical nationalist views.\n\nRussia had focused on Mariupol because capturing the city would help create a corridor between the annexed Crimean peninsula and pro-Russian separatist regions in eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussia's natural gas supplies to Finland were cut off on Saturday, Finland's state energy company Gasum said after the Scandinavian country refused to pay Gazprom in rubles.\n\n\"Natural gas supplies to Finland under the Gasum supply contract have been suspended,\" Gasum said in a statement, adding that natural gas would instead be supplied from other sources through the Balticconnector pipeline, which connects Finland with Estonia.\n\n\"Only diplomacy can end the war in Ukraine\", President Volodymyr Zelensky assured today, quoted by AFP. The agency notes that negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow are now at a dead end.\n\n\"The end (of the conflict) will be diplomatic. (The war) will be bloody, there will be battles, but it will end diplomatically,\" Zelensky said in an interview with Ukrainian television.\n\nThe Ukrainian president argued that \"there are things we can only achieve at the negotiating table.\" \"We want everything to return as before (the war) - something that (however) Russia does not want,\" he added, without going into details.\n\nEarlier this week, Zelensky's adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said Ukraine would not accept any ceasefire until all Russian troops had withdrawn. According to him, the situation on the ground has changed, but Russia does not understand this.\n\nIn response, the Kremlin accused Kyiv of \"complete unwillingness\" to negotiate.\n\nSeveral rounds of talks between the Ukrainian and Russian delegations since the start of the war on February 24 have failed. According to Russian media, the chief negotiators - Vladimir Medinsky for Russia and David Arakhamia for Ukraine - last met on April 22nd.\n\nAfter failing to capture the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, the Russian armed forces have focused on fully capturing the eastern Donbas region, where intense fighting is now taking place.", "source": {"uri": "new.sliven.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "new.sliven.net"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://new.sliven.net/res/news/393749/photo_verybig_215200.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 34, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 47, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7048991434", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "22:50:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T22:50:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T22:45:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "url": "https://nypost.com/2022/05/20/russia-claims-to-have-taken-full-control-of-mariupol/", "title": "Russia claims to have taken full control of Mariupol", "body": "Russia said its army seized control of Mariupol on Friday, in the country's biggest Ukraine war victory yet.\n\nThe last group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the Azovstal steelworks plant surrendered after a nearly three-month siege killed thousands and left the port city in shambles, according to Russia's defense ministry.\n\n\"Underground structures of Azovstal where militants were hiding are now under full control of Russian armed forces,\" the ministry said in a statement, noting that 2,439 Ukrainian fighters have surrendered.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin \"complete liberation\" of the plant -- the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance and the city itself.\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine Friday.\n\nThe steel mill had been blasted for weeks by Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire as the number of Ukrainian holdout fighters dwindled.\n\nRussia's declaration of victory in the city came hours after Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky said the holdout fighters were ordered by his military to get out of the plant and save their lives.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a much-needed military victory in a months-long conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning-fast win for the Kremlin.\n\nRussia's military has instead failed to take the capital of Kyiv and pulled back forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine.\n\nMilitary analysts said the city's capture now holds largely symbolic significance since Mariupol was already effectively under Moscow's control and most Russian forces that were tied down by the drawn-out fighting there have already left.\n\nRussia previously said that more than 900 Ukrainian troops at the besieged steel plant were sent to a prison colony on Russian-controlled territory.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the combatants would be treated under international norms for prisoners of war, though several senior Russian politicians demanded they be put on trial.\n\nThe Kremlin has wanted to control Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nIt also wanted to free up troops to join the larger battle for control of the Donbas and take the vital seaport.\n\nMariupol had suffered through some of the war's worst fallout -- becoming a worldwide symbol of defiance.

Others were said to be hospitalised.\n\nThe defence of the steel mill had been led by Ukraine's Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast its invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine.\n\nRussia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armoured vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometres, had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks.\n\nThe dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defence and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on 24 February -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nYet fighting continues to rage in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the region. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 people remained out of a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity.\n\nRelentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit by a lethal Russian airstrike on 9 March, producing shocking images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place.\n\nA week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theatre where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written to her on Thursday: \"Hello.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said more than 1,900 surrendered in recent days. Also remaining at the plant were the bodies of soldiers who defended it while tying down Russian forces.\n\nDenis Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, which had led the defense of the plant, called them \"fallen heroes.\"\n\n\"I hope soon relatives and the whole of Ukraine will be able to bury the fighters with honors,\" he said.\n\nPro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas for the past eight years and held a considerable swath of it before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. But the effort by Russian President Vladimir Putin's troops to take more territory there has been slow-going.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, the British Defense Ministry said.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine continued to blast away at targets, some of them civilian.\n\nIn the village of Velyka Kostromka, west of the Donbas, explosions in the middle of the night Thursday shook Iryna Martsyniuk's house to its foundations. Roof timbers splintered and windows shattered, sending shards of glass into a wall near three sleeping children.\n\n\"There were flashes everywhere,\" she said. \"The windows smashed, there was smoke everywhere.\"\n\nShe grabbed the children and ran toward the home's entrance. \"But the corridor wasn't there anymore. Instead, we saw the starry night,\" she said.\n\nThe family finally was able to climb out of the wrecked house through a back window. They ran down the road to a neighbor's home, where they hid in the basement.\n\nAround 20 other houses were damaged and two people were lightly injured, said Olha Shaytanova, the head of the village.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\n- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a US$40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n- Putin said his country has faced a tide of cyberattacks from the West but has managed to fend them off. He charged that \"an outright aggression has been unleashed against Russia, a war has been waged in the information space.\"\n\nOn Friday, a governor in the Donbas said Russian forces attacked the cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk. Twelve people were killed and more than 60 houses destroyed across the region, Luhansk Gov.

Others were said to be hospitalized.\n\nThe defense of the steel mill had been led by Ukraine's Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast its invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 4 square miles, had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defense and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nIn other developments Friday, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine and fighting raged in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the Donbas.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nPOKROVSK, Ukraine (AP) -- The West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine on Friday, as Russia shifted troops freed up by the imminent fall of the pulverized city of Mariupol and fighting raged in the country's industrial heartland in the east.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking eastern expanse of coal mines and factories that Russian President Vladimir Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\n\"The liberation of the Luhansk People's Republic is nearing completion,\" Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu declared, referring to the breakaway state proclaimed by pro-Moscow separatists in 2014 and recognized by the Kremlin.\n\nIn Mariupol, the strategic port in the southern corner of the Donbas, Russian troops worn down by their nearly three-month siege of the city may not get the time they need to regroup, Britain's Defense Ministry said.\n\nWith the battle winding down for the Azovstal steel plant that represented the last bastion of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol, Russia is continuing to pull back forces there, and their commanders are under pressure to quickly send them elsewhere in the Donbas, according to the British.\n\n\"That means that Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition,\" the ministry said.\n\nAn undisclosed number of Ukrainian soldiers remained at the Azovstal steel plant. Russia said more than 1,900 had surrendered in recent days. Also remaining at the plant were the bodies of soldiers who defended it while tying down Russian forces.\n\nDenis Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, which led the defense of the plant, called them \"fallen heroes.\"\n\n\"I hope soon relatives and the whole of Ukraine will be able to bury the fighters with honors,\" he said.\n\nWives of fighters who held out at the steelworks spoke emotionally about what may have been their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\nMeanwhile, fighting intensified deeper in the Donbas.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces were especially focused on the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway, the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The road is extremely important because it's the only connection to other regions of the country,\" he said via email. \"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region.\"\n\nRussian forces shelled the road constantly from multiple directions, but Ukrainian armored transports were still able to get through, Haidai added.\n\nMoscow's troops have been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas. One of Friday's attacks was on a school in Severodonetsk that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, Haidai said. Three adults were killed, he said on Telegram.\n\nTwelve people were killed in Severodonetsk, Haidai said. It was not immediately clear if that included the three at the school. In addition, more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nRussian forces now control 90 percent of Luhansk, but the attack on Severodonetsk failed -- \"the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated,\" Haidai said. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nPro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas for the past eight years and held a considerable swath of it before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. But the effort by Putin's troops to take more territory there has been slow-going.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, Britain's Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian forces elsewhere in Ukraine continued to blast away at targets, some of them civilian.\n\nIn the village of Velyka Kostromka, west of the Donbas, explosions in the middle of the night Thursday shook Iryna Martsyniuk's house to its foundations. Roof timbers splintered and windows shattered, sending shards of glass into a wall near three sleeping children.\n\n\"There were flashes everywhere,\" she said. \"There was smoke everywhere.\" She grabbed the children and ran toward the home's entrance, \"but the corridor wasn't there anymore. Instead, we saw the starry night.\"\n\nThey ran down the road to a neighbor's home, where they hid in the basement.\n\nAround 20 other houses were damaged and two people were lightly wounded, said Olha Shaytanova, head of the village.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

It would also deprive Ukraine of a vital port.\n\nThe city endured some of the worst suffering of the war. An estimated 100,000 people remained from a pre-war population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity.

Officials had written the word \"CHILDREN\" in Russian on the pavement outside to try to forestall an aerial attack.\n\nLong traffic jams of cars snaked out of the city, filled with evacuees fleeing past checkpoints of Russian soldiers with heavy weapons who didn't have time to search inside each vehicle in the convoys.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves near Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians. The imagery showed rows of graves stretching away from an existing cemetery in the town of Manhush, outside the port city.\n\nMariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko accused the Russians of \"hiding their military crimes\" in the mass graves and labelled it \"the new Babi Yar\" -- recalling the ravine in Kyiv where the Nazis massacred nearly 34,000 Ukrainian Jews during World War II.\n\nIt was not the first time Moscow has claimed to have captured Mariupol.\n\nAt a joint appearance with his defence minister on April 21, Putin declared that \"the completion of combat work to liberate Mariupol is a success.\"\n\nEven though die-hard Ukrainian forces were still inside the Azovstal plant at that point, Putin ordered the military to seal off the complex \"so that not even a fly comes through.\"\n\nAfter continued bombardment, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on May 16 the evacuation of his forces from the bunkers and tunnels beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\n\"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe Azovstal complex covers 11 square kilometres and is threaded with about 24 kilometres of tunnels and bunkers. Earlier in May, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires.\n\nOne civilian evacuee from Azovstal, who made it to the Ukrainian controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on May 3, said she went to sleep at the plant every night afraid she wouldn't wake up. \"You can't imagine how scary it is when you sit in the bomb shelter, in a damp and wet basement, and it is bouncing and shaking,\" said Elina Tsybulchenko, 54.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a fulfilled mission.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defence of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" - a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\n\"The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy's plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war,\" Podolyak said.\n\nDeputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said Mariupol's defenders gave Ukraine \"critically important time to form reserves and regroup forces and receive help from partners. And they fulfilled all their tasks.\"\n\n___\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv. Stashevskyi reported from Kyiv.

We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\nHeavy fighting was reported Friday in the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking expanse of coal mines and factories.\n\n\"The liberation of the Luhansk People's Republic is nearing completion,\" Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu declared, referring to the breakaway state proclaimed by pro-Moscow separatists in 2014 and recognized by the Kremlin.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces were especially focused on the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway, the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The road is extremely important because it's the only connection to other regions of the country,\" he said via email. \"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region.\"\n\nRussian forces shelled the road constantly from multiple directions, but Ukrainian armored transports were still able to get through, Haidai added.\n\nMoscow's troops have been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas. One of Friday's attacks was on a school in Severodonetsk that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, Haidai said. Three adults were killed, he said on Telegram.\n\nTwelve people were killed in Severodonetsk, Haidai said. It was not immediately clear if that included the three at the school. In addition, more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nRussian forces now control 90 percent of Luhansk, but the attack on Severodonetsk failed -- \"the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated,\" Haidai said. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

The Russians then carefully searched each man and their possessions and also appeared to be asking the defenders to show their tattoos\n\nUkraine's Azov regiment commander Denys Prokopenko had earlier said only the dead remained.\n\n\"The higher military command has given the order to save the lives of the soldiers of our garrison and to stop defending the city,\" he said in a video on Telegram.\n\n\"I now hope that soon, the families and all of Ukraine will be able to bury their fighters with honors.\"\n\nUkraine wants to exchange the surrendering Azovstal soldiers for Russian prisoners.

Water, food, medicine and ammunition were all in short supply.\n\nIn what amounted to an admission of defeat, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared the two-month-long battle for the last contested piece of Mariupol over at the start of the week, paving the way for the Ukrainian troops to be taken prisoner by the Russians.\n\nOn Monday, the first 264 soldiers surrendered, including more than 50 seriously injured. According to Russia, more were captured on Thursday, but commanders and some fighters had continued to hold their ground.\n\nBut earlier on Friday, the remaining Ukrainian defenders of the steel plant had decided that they saw no point in continuing on, according to a video message released by Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment.\n\n\"The army leadership has given the order to stop defending the city,\" Prokopenko said, adding the decision was taken to protect the lives and health of the soldiers.\n\nA total of 2,439 Ukrainian combatants have been taken into Russian captivity at the steelworks since May 16, according to the ministry.\n\nMoscow had always said they it assumed there were about 2,500 Ukrainian fighters at the site. The government in Kyiv, on the other hand, had given their number as only 1,000.\n\nThe Kremlin has not clarified what comes next. Kyiv has suggested they could be exchanged for Russians held by Ukraine, although some in Moscow have called for the Ukrainian forces to be treated as criminals and put on trial.\n\nMost of the devastated city's pre-war population of 400,000 has fled in recent weeks.\n\nRussia was focused on Mariupol because conquering the city would help create a corridor between the Crimean peninsula and pro-Russian separatist regions in eastern Ukraine.\n\nMoscow claimed success in that part of Ukraine, too.\n\nDefence Minister Shoigu said earlier in the day that Russian troops were continuing their advance across the eastern Donbass region and the \"liberation\" of the Luhansk People's Republic was close at hand,\n\nThe Donbass, where fighting has intensified in recent weeks, contains the two self-declared \"people's republics\" of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were formed by pro-Russian separatists in 2014.\n\nPutin had announced that Russia would recognize the breakaway regions as independent of Ukraine shortly before launching his invasion on February 24.\n\nMeanwhile, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said expanding its investigation into human rights violations committed during Russia's war.\n\nObservers have been sent to Ukraine to interview witnesses and survivors, the OSCE Office for Democracy and Human Rights says.\n\nThe office has also interviewed people who fled to neighboring countries before Moscow's invasion began.\n\nThe OSCE is focusing on the civilian population and prisoners of war, with attacks on civilians, killings, abductions and torture the most urgent issues. It will likely be months before a report is ready.\n\nOnly a small number of the alleged atrocities against civilians in Ukraine for which Russian soldiers stand accused are even reported, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\n\"We have found evidence of many crimes, including sexual crimes, which often go unreported,\" Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.

Shoigu said Russian troops and separatist militias were expanding their control there.\n\nDONBAS FOCUS\n\nRussia's focus on the Donbas follows its failure to capture the capital Kyiv in the early stages of the invasion launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24.\n\nIn the weeks of warfare pitting Russia's military might against dogged Ukrainian resistance, thousands of people have been killed and whole urban areas shattered in the gravest crisis in Europe in decades.\n\nAlmost a third of Ukraine's people have fled their homes, including more than 6 million who have left the country, while others remain trapped in cities pulverised by Russian bombardments.\n\nAnalysts say that while Russian forces have advanced in Luhansk, they have made less progress in Donetsk. They have also been pushed back from the city of Kharkiv, north of the Donbas and close to the Russian border.\n\nBritish military intelligence said on Friday Russia is likely to further reinforce its operations in the Donbas once it finally secures Mariupol scene of a weeks-long siege and Moscow's biggest success in a campaign of mixed fortunes.\n\nPutin calls the invasion a \"special military operation\" to rid the country of fascists an assertion Kyiv and its Western allies say is a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's need to boost its war effort, the parliament in Moscow said it would consider a bill to allow Russians over 40 and foreigners over 30 to sign up for the military.\n\nHOLD OUT\n\nThe past week has seen Russia all but secure victory in Mariupol, with the Kyiv government ordering the defenders of the Azovstal steelworks to stand down.\n\nBritish military intelligence said as many as 1,700 soldiers were likely to have surrendered at the plant. Russian Defence minister Shoigu put the number of those laying down their arms at about 2,000.\n\nUkrainian officials, who have tried to arrange a prisoner swap, have declined to comment on the number, saying it could endanger rescue efforts.\n\nThe commander of Ukraine's Azov Regiment said on Friday all civilians and wounded Ukrainian fighters had now been evacuated from Azovstal.\n\n\"The heavily wounded received the necessary assistance and they were evacuated, to be later exchanged and delivered to territory controlled by Ukraine,\" Commander Denys Prokopenko said in a video message.\n\nThe process of removing the dead was still under way.\n\n\"I hope that in the near future, relatives and Ukraine will be able to bury their soldiers with honor,\" Prokopenko said.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said it had registered hundreds of prisoners from Azovstal now held by Russia, but it has not given a precise number.\n\nWESTERN SUPPORT\n\nWestern powers, who have strongly condemned Russia's actions and sought to isolate Moscow with an array of sanctions, were stepping up support for Ukraine.\n\nThe Group of Seven rich nations on Thursday agreed to provide Ukraine with $18.4 billion to make up revenues as the war wrecks its economy.\n\nThe US Senate approved nearly $40 billion in new aid, by far the largest US aid package to date.\n\nThe White House is also working to get advanced anti-ship missiles to Ukraine to help defeat Russia's naval blockade, which has largely stopped Ukraine's food exports.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Russia of using food as a weapon, holding \"hostage\" supplies for millions around the world. The war has caused global prices for grains, cooking oils, fuel and fertiliser to soar.\n\nThe European Union said it is looking into ways of using the frozen assets of Russian oligarchs to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, while the United States has not ruled out possibly placing sanctions on countries that purchase Russian oil.", "source": {"uri": "intellasia.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "IntellAsia"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 30, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 43, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7048824312", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "19:03:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T19:03:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T19:03:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "url": "https://www.breakingnews.ie/ukraine/ukraine-says-it-repels-attack-in-east-as-russian-troops-struggle-to-gain-ground-1307889.html", "title": "Ukraine says it repels attack in east as Russian troops struggle to gain ground | BreakingNews.ie", "body": "Ukrainian authorities said their troops have repelled a Russian attack in the east, as Moscow struggled to gain ground in the region that is now the focus of the war.\n\nBattered by their long siege of the vital port city of Mariupol, Russian troops need time to regroup, according to an assessment by Britain's Ministry of Defence. But they may not get it.\n\nThe city and the steelworks where Ukrainian fighters have held off the Russian assault for weeks have become a symbol of Ukraine's stoic resistance and surprising ability to hinder a much larger force.\n\nAn undisclosed number of Ukrainian soldiers remained at the Azovstal steel plant. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said more than 1,900 had surrendered in recent days.\n\nAlso remaining at the plant are the bodies of soldiers who defended it while tying down Russian forces. Denis Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, which had led the defence of the plant, called them \"fallen heroes\".\n\nHe said: \"I hope soon relatives and the whole of Ukraine will be able to bury the fighters with honours.\"\n\nHe also said that the defenders of Mariupol have received an order to \"cease the defence of the city\". The intention is to \"save the lives and health of the servicemen of the garrison\", he said.\n\nWith the battle for the steel plant winding down, Russia has already started pulling troops back from the site. But the British assessment indicated Russian commanders are under pressure to quickly send them elsewhere in the Donbas.\n\n\"That means that Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition,\" the MoD said.\n\nThe Donbas is now President Vladimir Putin's focus after his troops failed to take the capital in the early days of the war. Pro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces for eight years in the region and held a considerable swathe of it before Russia's invasion on February 24.\n\nBut the effort to take more territory there has been slow-going. In a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, the MoD said.\n\nRussian forces attacked the cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk, both in the Luhansk region of the Donbas, the region's governor said on Friday.\n\nTwelve people were killed, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, said Serhiy Haidai in a Telegram post.\n\nBut the attack on Severodonetsk was unsuccessful. Both Mr Haidai and Ukraine's General Staff of the military said Russia took losses and retreated. Their reports could not be independently verified.\n\nStill, Russia's struggles in the east only seemed to translate into an intensifying offensive that is inflicting increasing suffering.\n\n\"It is hell there, and that's not an exaggeration,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of the campaign.\n\n\"The brutal and completely senseless bombardment of Severodonetsk. Twelve dead and dozens wounded there in just one day,\" he said in his nightly video address to the nation.\n\nMeanwhile, in the first war crimes trial held by Ukraine, Sgt Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old member of a Russian tank unit, told a court in Kyiv on Thursday that he shot Oleksandr Shelipov, a 62-year-old Ukrainian civilian, in the head on orders from an officer.\n\nShishimarin apologised to the victim's widow, Kateryna Shelipova, who described seeing her husband being shot just outside their home in the early days of Russia's invasion.\n\nShe told the court that she believes Shishimarin deserves a life sentence, the maximum possible, but that she would not mind if he were exchanged as part of a swap for the Azovstal defenders.\n\nUkraine's surprisingly stiff resistance has been bolstered by western arms and funding - and more help was on the way this week.\n\nThe G7 has agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's public finances, bringing the total aid to 19.8 billion dollars (\u00a315.8 billion), Germany's finance minister said. The goal is to ensure that Ukraine's financial situation does not affect its ability to defend itself from Russia's invasion.\n\nAlso, more US aid appeared to be on its way to Ukraine when the Senate overwhelmingly approved a 40 billion dollar package of military and economic aid for the country and its allies. The house of representatives voted for it last week, and US President Joe Biden's quick signature is certain.\n\n\"Help is on the way, really significant help. Help that could make sure that the Ukrainians are victorious,\" senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said.\n\nIn other developments, Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke by phone on Thursday with his Russian counterpart for the first time since the war began.\n\nThey agreed to keep the lines of communications open, the Pentagon said.\n\nWhile Mariupol was a target from the start of the invasion and has been under effective Russian control for some time, a group of Ukrainian fighters have held out in the sprawling steel plant - symbolic of the way Ukrainian forces have managed to grind down the Russian troops.\n\nWhile hundreds of fighters have left, in a brief video message, the deputy commander of the Azov Regiment said he and other fighters were still inside.\n\n\"An operation is under way, the details of which I will not announce,\" said Svyatoslav Palamar.\n\nWhile Ukraine has expressed hope for a prisoner exchange for those who have surrendered, Russian authorities have threatened to possibly try for war crimes some of the Azovstal fighters.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News.ie"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlcy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvcHJvZFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjJcXFwvMDVcXFwvMjAwNzAzMjJcXFwvMi42Njk4MzQ4OS0yLmpwZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjI3LFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuYnJlYWtpbmduZXdzLmllXFxcL2ltYWdlc1xcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmdcIixcIm9wdGlvbnNcIjpbXX0iLCJoYXNoIjoiZWFiM2VhOGFhMzZmNTJiMzFmNjI3MjcwMjdjZGU0NGFiNGY1Njc0ZiJ9/ukraine-says-it-repels-attack-in-east-as-russian-troops-struggle-to-gain-ground.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 30, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 43, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049502352", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "11:48:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T11:48:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T11:29:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "url": "https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/21/in-biggest-victory-yet-russia-claims-to-capture-mariupol-00034233", "title": "In biggest victory yet, Russia claims to capture Mariupol", "body": "Russia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the ministry as saying a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters who had been holed up at the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday.\n\nAs they surrendered, the troops were taken prisoner by the Russians, and at least some were taken to a former penal colony.

Luhansk is part of the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking eastern expanse of coal mines and factories that Russian President Vladimir Putin is bent on capturing.\n\n\"The liberation of the Luhansk People's Republic is nearing completion,\" Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu declared, referring to the breakaway state proclaimed by pro-Moscow separatists in 2014 and recognized by the Kremlin.\n\nIn Mariupol, the strategic port in the southern corner of the Donbas, Russian troops worn down by their nearly three-month siege of the city may not get the time they need to regroup, Britain's Defense Ministry said.\n\nWith the battle winding down for the Azovstal steel plant that represented the last bastion of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol, Russia is continuing to pull back forces there, and their commanders are under pressure to quickly send them elsewhere in the Donbas, according to the British.\n\n\"That means that Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition,\" the ministry said.\n\nAn undisclosed number of Ukrainian soldiers remained at the Azovstal steel plant. Russia said more than 1,900 had surrendered in recent days. Also remaining at the plant were the bodies of soldiers who defended it while tying down Russian forces.\n\nDenis Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, which led the defense of the plant, called them \"fallen heroes.\"\n\n\"I hope soon relatives and the whole of Ukraine will be able to bury the fighters with honors,\" he said.\n\nWives of fighters who held out at the steelworks spoke emotionally about what may have been their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\nMeanwhile, fighting intensified deeper in the Donbas.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces were especially focused on the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway, the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The road is extremely important because it's the only connection to other regions of the country,\" he said via email. \"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region.\"\n\nRussian forces shelled the road constantly from multiple directions, but Ukrainian armored transports were still able to get through, Haidai added.\n\nMoscow's troops have been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas. One of Friday's attacks was on a school in Severodonetsk that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, Haidai said. Three adults were killed, he said on Telegram.\n\nTwelve people were killed in Severodonetsk, Haidai said. It was not immediately clear if that included the three at the school. In addition, more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nRussian forces now control 90 percent of Luhansk, but the attack on Severodonetsk failed -- \"the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated,\" Haidai said. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nPro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas for the past eight years and held a considerable swath of it before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. But the effort by Putin's troops to take more territory there has been slow-going.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, Britain's Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian forces elsewhere in Ukraine continued to blast away at targets, some of them civilian.\n\nIn the village of Velyka Kostromka, west of the Donbas, explosions in the middle of the night Thursday shook Iryna Martsyniuk's house to its foundations. Roof timbers splintered and windows shattered, sending shards of glass into a wall near three sleeping children.\n\n\"There were flashes everywhere,\" she said. \"There was smoke everywhere.\" She grabbed the children and ran toward the home's entrance, \"but the corridor wasn't there anymore. Instead, we saw the starry night.\"\n\nThey ran down the road to a neighbor's home, where they hid in the basement.\n\nAround 20 other houses were damaged and two people were lightly wounded, said Olha Shaytanova, head of the village.\n\n___\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

I believe that justice must be restored. There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency Tass quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly have tried to characterize the fighters who holed up in the Azovstal steel plant as neo-Nazis. Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance, and with it completing Moscow's long-sought goal of controlling the city, home to a strategic seaport.\n\nUkraine's military this week told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe impact of Russia's declared victory on the broader war in Ukraine remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict, which began with the Russian invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nIn its morning operational report, the Ukrainian military general staff reported heavy fighting in much of eastern Ukraine, including the areas of Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nSince failing to reach and capture Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Russia focused its offensive in the country's eastern industrial heartland. The Russia-backed separatists have controlled parts of the Donbas region since 2014, and Moscow wants to expand the territory under its control.\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockkaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nAs the end drew near at the steel plant, wives of fighters who had held out told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, the wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she shared the words her husband wrote her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nThe wife of another fighter, Natalia Zaritskaya, said her husband reported earlier this week that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived and most were seriously wounded.\n\n\"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly,\" Zaritskaya said.\n\nThe seasize steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been a battleground for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters held out with the help of air drops of supplies, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant and save themselves.\n\nRussia said the Azov Regiment's commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred for him.\n\nNo evidence of Ukrainian antipathy toward the nationalist regiment has emerged. The Kremlin has seized on the regiment's far-right origins in its drive to to cast the invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial.\n\nCapturing Mariupol furthers Russia's quest to essentially create a land bridge from Russia via much of the Donbas area bordering Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe city's seizure also helps Russian leader Putin offset some stinging setbacks, including the failure to take over Kyiv, the sinking of the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea and continued resistance that has stalled the offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nWith Mariupol under Russian control, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in the city, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theater where civilians had taken cover.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAt one point in the siege, Pope Francis lamented that Mariupol had become a \"city of martyrs.\"\n\nAn estimated 100,000 of the 450,000 people who resided there before the war remain. Many, trapped by Russia's siege, were left without food, water and electricity.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the steel plant during humanitarian cease-fires. They spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nThe chief executive of Metinvest, a multinational company which owns the Azovstal plant and another steel mill, Ilyich, in Mariupol, spoke of the city's devastation in an interview published Saturday in Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to clean it (the city) up to hide their crimes,'' the newspaper quoted Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov as saying. \"The inhabitants are trying to make the city function, to make water supplies work again.\"\n\n\"But the sewer system is damaged, there has been flooding, and infections are feared\" from drinking the water, he said.\n\nThe Ilyich steelworks still has some intact infrastructure, but if the Russians try to get it running, Ukrainians will refuse to return to their jobs there, Ryzhenkov said.\n\n\"We will never work under Russian occupation,'' Ryzhenkov said.", "source": {"uri": "daily-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daily_sun@daily-sun.com", "name": "Daily Sun", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.daily-sun.com/assets/importent_images/common-pic-large.png", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 16, "stanza_neu": 31, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 47, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049699136", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "15:55:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T15:55:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T15:52:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-10839997/EXPLAINER-Who-Mariupols-defenders.html", "title": "EXPLAINER: Who were Mariupol's last defenders?", "body": "The Ukrainian forces who made a determined last stand in a Mariupol steel mill against Russian troops were a mixture of seasoned soldiers, border guards, a controversial national guard regiment and volunteers who took up arms in the weeks before Russia\u00b4s invasion.\n\nAs Russia announced it had completed its takeover of Mariupol with the surrender of the fighters who served as the final obstacle, Ukraine's government did not confirm the city's fall. Earlier in the week, Ukrainian officials said its combantants in the Azovstal steel plant had completed their mission and were being evacuated, describing them as heroes who had fulfilled a grueling task.\n\nHere's a look at these Ukrainian forces, who were taken prisoner by the Russians as they left the plant, and what they accomplished:\n\nWHO WERE THE DEFENDERS OF MARIUPOL?\n\nRussia\u00b4s Defense Ministry said a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters from the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nThe fighters who held out at Azovstal, for much of the nearly three-month siege of Mariupol with Ukrainian civilians who sought safety in the plant's underground bunkers and tunnels, came from a variety of different military and law enforcement units, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nUkrainian servicemen sit in a bus after leaving Mariupol's besieged Azovstal steel plant, near a penal colony, in Olyonivka, in territory under the government of the Donetsk People's Republic, eastern Ukraine, Friday, May 20, 2022. (AP Photo)\n\nThere was the Azov Regiment, which is part of Ukraine's National Guard; the 36th Special Marine Brigade of Ukraine's Naval Forces and the 12th brigade of the National Guard. Border guards, police officers, and territorial defense squads formed shortly before the war supplemented their ranks.\n\nThe bulk of these forces were deployed to defend Mariupol, home to a stategically located port, at the start of the Russian invasion. Marines from the 36th brigade held the port and another large plant in Mariupol for more than a month, until they ran out of supplies and ammunition.\n\nThey moved to the Azovstal steel mill to join the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right, and some of them were captured by the Russians.\n\nWHY DOES RUSSIA LABEL THEM 'NATIONALISTS\u00b4?\n\nIn announcing Azovstal's seizure, the Russian Defense Ministry's chief spokesman referred to the Azov Regiment's fighters as Nazis and said their commander was taken away in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred of him \"for numerous atrocities.\"\n\nNo evidence has surfaced of the regiment mistreating Ukrainian civilians, hundreds of whom sheltered underground with the fighters. The regiment released several videos taken inside Azovstal that showed their members interacting with the civilians and giving children sweets.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly made negative assertions about the Azov Regiment.\n\nThe National Guard unit grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that rose to bolster Ukraine\u00b4s underfunded and questionably led military in the fight against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThat conflict broke out after massive protests drove Ukraine\u00b4s Kremlin-leaning president from office.\n\nThe Azov Battalion drew its initial fighters from far-right circles and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. Its current members rejected accusations of nationalism and radicalism. Sviatoslav Palamar, the regiment's deputy commander, said in a recent interview from the steel mill that he preferred the term \"patriotism.\"\n\nWHAT DID THE DEFENDERS ACCOMPLISH?\n\nAs Mariupol became a symbol of the suffering and resistance of Ukrainians after Russia invaded their country, Ukrainian officials repeatedly stressed the role the fighters at Azovstal played in defending the city and stymying Russian progress elsewhere.\n\n\"The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol have already performed a feat, drawing the elite forces of the Russian army onto themselves and significantly slowing down the advance of the Russians in the southeast,\" Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said.\n\nAfter the plant's defenders were instructed to end their fight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the move was proper and humane because \"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It\u00b4s our principle.\"\n\nThe ruined seaside city and the outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian fighters whose persistence frustrated Russia's objective to capture Mariupol quickly are now irrevocably etched into Ukrainian history, regardless of the outcome of the war.\n\nThe defense of Mariupol \"will go down in history as Thermopylae of the 21st century,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine\u00b4s president, said as the fighters started leaving the plant. \"The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy\u00b4s plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war.\"\n\nThermopylae is widely considered one of history\u00b4s most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.

The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out in the plant, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire before their government ordered them to abandon its defense and save their lives.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed military victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a quick and easy victory for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of its forces to refocus on battles in eastern Ukraine and even the sinking of Russia's flagship of its Black Sea fleet, the Moskva.\n\nMilitary analysts say the city's capture at this point holds more symbolic importance than anything else, since Mariupol is already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the drawn-out fighting have already left.\n\nRussia had sought control of Mariupol, on the coast of the Sea of Azov, to complete a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the growing battle for control of the wider industrial Donbas region, home to an 8-year-old Moscow-backed separatist rebellion. It would also deprive Ukraine of a vital port.\n\nThe city endured some of the worst suffering of the war. An estimated 100,000 people remained from a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Constant bombardment has left behind shattered and charred buildings in row after row of destroyed apartment blocks and ruined neighborhoods.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the facility.\n\nA week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.

Most of the city's pre-war 400,000 population has fled in recent weeks.\n\nYesterday, Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin that the Azovstal plant and the whole of Mariupol were \"completely liberated.\"\n\nRussia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the Russian Defense Ministry as saying that as of May 16, a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters who had been blocked at Azovstal had laid down their arms, including 531 yesterday, who according to Moscow, were the last defenders of the plant.\n\n\"The territory of the Azovstal metallurgical plant has been completely liberated,\" the Russian Defense Ministry said. \"The underground facilities of the plant where the Ukrainian fighters were hiding are now under the full control of the Russian armed forces.\"\n\nThe ministry released a video that allegedly shows the surrender of Ukrainians. On it, unarmed men approached a line of Russian soldiers in front of the plant and announce their names. The Russians then carefully searched each of them and their belongings and asked the defenders to show off their tattoos.\n\nRussian attacks on the city began shortly after the conflict broke out.\n\nAs Russian troops gradually gained control of the strategic city near the Sea of Azov through constant bombing and blockades, the last defenders of Mariupol took refuge in Azovstal, which has an underground network of bunkers and tunnels. They did not have enough water, food, medicine and ammunition.\n\nEarlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a statement tantamount to admitting defeat. He announced that the two-month battle for the last remaining unconquered part of Azovstal was over, paving the way for the capture of Ukrainian troops by the Russians.\n\nThe first 264 of them surrendered on Monday, including more than 50 seriously injured. According to Russia, more were captured on Thursday, but commanders and some other fighters continued to defend their positions.\n\nYesterday, however, the remaining Ukrainian defenders at the plant decided that there was no point in continuing to fight, according to a video message from Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment of the National Guard of Ukraine.\n\n\"The army command has ordered the defense of the city to be suspended,\" Prokopenko said, adding that the decision was made to protect the lives and health of soldiers.\n\nYesterday, hours before Russia announced full control of the city, Zelensky said defenders had been told by the Ukrainian army to come out and save their lives.\n\nAccording to him, the Ukrainian Air Force tried to provide air supply to Mariupol but was repulsed, suffering heavy losses.\n\n\"Unfortunately, a large number of our pilots died,\" Zelensky said on Ukrainian television. \"These were heroes in the full sense of the word, who knew it was hard, that it was almost impossible to fly there, to transport food, water and medicine by air to Azovstal, and to return the wounded and the bodies of the dead.\"\n\nUkrainian Interior Minister Anton Gerashchenko said the plant's defense would be studied in military schools for years to come. People inside did not have fresh water and had only one meal a day, he said.\n\nThe Kremlin has not said what comes next for the captives. Kyiv has offered to exchange them for Russians in Ukrainian captivity, although some in Moscow have called for them to be treated as criminals and tried.\n\nMoscow considers the Azov Regiment \"Nazis\". The unit, which was formed in 2014 as a militia to fight pro-Russian separatists, denies being fascist, and Ukraine says it has reformed its original radical nationalist views.\n\nRussia had focused on Mariupol because capturing the city would help create a corridor between the annexed Crimean peninsula and pro-Russian separatist regions in eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussia has stopped gas flow to Finland\n\nRussia's natural gas supplies to Finland were cut off on Saturday, Finland's state energy company Gasum said after the Scandinavian country refused to pay Gazprom in rubles.\n\n\"Natural gas supplies to Finland under the Gasum supply contract have been suspended,\" Gasum said in a statement, adding that natural gas would instead be supplied from other sources through the Balticconnector pipeline, which connects Finland with Estonia.\n\nSeveral rounds of talks between the Ukrainian and Russian delegations since the start of the war on February 24 have failed.

It said a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters who had been holed up at the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including more than 500 on Friday.\n\nA defence ministry video purporting to show the surrender showed a line of unarmed men approaching Russian soldiers outside the plant and giving their names. The Russians then carefully searched each man and their possessions and also appeared to be asking them to show their tattoos.\n\nHours earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the last defenders at the steelworks had been told by Ukraine's military that they could get out and save their lives. The Ukrainians did not immediately confirm the Russian figures on Azovstal.\n\nUkraine's General Staff of Armed Forces did not comment on Russia's claims in its morning update on Saturday.\n\nThe abandonment of the bunkers and tunnels of the bombed-out plant by the Azov Regiment means an end to the most destructive siege of a war that began when Russia invaded Ukraine nearly three months ago.\n\nMuch of Mariupol has been reduced to a smoking ruin, with more than 20,000 civilians feared dead.\n\nThe defence of the steel mill had been led by Ukraine's Azov regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast its invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armoured vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometres ( four square miles), had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks.

Denis Pushilin, the pro-Kremlin head of an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, claimed that 2,439 people were in custody. He said on Russian state TV that the figure includes some foreign nationals, though he did not provide further details.\n\nFamily members of the steel mill fighters, who authorities say came from a variety of military and law enforcement units, have pleaded for them to be given rights as prisoners of war and eventually returned to Ukraine. They are considered heroes by their fellow citizens.\n\nUkraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Saturday that authorities \"will fight for the return of every soldier\" captured from Azovstal steelworks.\n\nConvoys of buses, guarded by Russian armored vehicles, left the plant Friday. At least some Ukrainians were taken to a former penal colony, while Russian authorities said others were hospitalized.\n\nPushilin said the Ukrainians were sure to face a tribunal. Russian officials and state media have sought to characterize the fighters as neo-Nazis and criminals.\n\n\"I believe that justice must be restored. There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency Tass quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nAmong the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast its invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance. Ukraine's military had told the fighters that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe end of the battle for Mariupol would help Putin offset some stinging setbacks, including the failure of Russian troops to take over Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, the sinking of the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea and the continued resistance that has stalled an offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nIt also furthers Russia's quest to essentially create a land bridge from Russia stretching through the Donbas region to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe impact on the broader war remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base in the Black Sea region of Odesa as well as a significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn its morning operational report, the Ukrainian military general staff reported heavy fighting in much of eastern Ukraine, including the areas of Severodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said that Russia is expected to relaunch an offensive on the strategically important city of Sloviansk, in the Donetsk region. The city is critical to Russia's objective of capturing all of eastern Ukraine and saw fierce fighting last month after Moscow's troops backed off from Kyiv.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, the governor of the region of Luhansk, Serhii Haidai, said the only functioning hospital in the city of Severodonetsk had just three doctors and supplies for 10 days. In the Donetsk region, Russian shelling on Saturday killed seven civilians and injured 10 more, the regional governor said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday dismissed the idea of launching a counterattack into Russian territory but emphasized that the Donbas region remains sovereign to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking at a joint media conference with Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa, Zelenskyy said his forces were fighting to \"liberate our territory\" and the price of \"tens or hundreds of thousands of lives\" was too high to surrender it. He pressed Western countries for multiple launch rocket systems, which he said \"just stand still\" in other countries yet are \"key\" to Ukraine's success.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden signed off Saturday on a fresh, $40 billion infusion of aid for Ukraine, with half for military assistance. Portugal pledged up to 250 million euros, as well as continued shipments of military equipment.\n\nZelenskyy reiterated his intention to apply for European Union membership and accused Russia of blockading agricultural exports from Ukraine, which is known as the \"breadbasket of Europe.\"\n\nTags Ukraine Military Politics Navy Russia Azovstal Denis Pushilin Volodymyr Zelenskyy Government State Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "roanoke.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roanoke Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oleksandr_stashevskyi@roanoke.com", "name": "Oleksandr Stashevskyi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "elena_becatoros@roanoke.com", "name": "Elena Becatoros", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/roanoke.com/content/tncms/custom/image/00f1ee32-f2d0-11e6-9926-f7249dbfe53a.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 9, "stanza_neu": 41, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 50, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7048342924", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "11:54:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T11:54:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T11:53:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6627451181411743, "url": "https://www.dailysabah.com/world/europe/ukraines-donbass-destroyed-as-russia-steps-up-strikes-on-east", "title": "Ukraine's Donbass 'destroyed' as Russia steps up strikes on east", "body": "At least 3 stabbed in family-related attack in southeast Norway\n\nRussian forces have bombarded eastern Ukraine from land and air, killing at least 13 civilians, Ukraine's military said Friday, while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Donbass region was \"completely destroyed\" and called it \"hell.\"\n\nAs the war neared the three-month mark, the Russians were intensifying their efforts to subdue the Donbass region, the Ukrainian general staff said.\n\nThey had hit civilian infrastructure with \"massive\" artillery shelling, including multiple rocket launchers, the general staff said in a statement.

The U.S. Senate approved nearly $40 billion in new aid for Ukraine, by far the largest U.S. aid package to date. The White House is also working to put advanced anti-ship missiles in the hands of Ukrainian fighters to help defeat Russia's naval blockade, which has largely stopped Ukraine's exports of food.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Russia of using food as a weapon by holding \"hostage\" supplies for not just Ukrainians, but also millions around the world. The war has caused global prices for grains, cooking oils, fuel and fertilizer to soar.\n\nThe EU said it is looking into ways of using the frozen assets of Russian oligarchs to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, while the United States has not ruled out possibly placing sanctions on countries that purchase Russian oil.\n\nThe past week has seen Russia secure its biggest victory since the invasion began, with the Kyiv government ordering the defenders of a steelworks in Mariupol to stand down after a protracted siege.\n\nBritish military intelligence said as many as 1,700 soldiers were likely to have surrendered at the Azovstal steel factory, matching a similar number released on Thursday by Moscow.\n\nUkrainian officials, who have tried to arrange a prisoner swap, have declined to comment on the number, saying it could endanger rescue efforts.\n\nLate on Thursday, Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy head of the Azov Regiment defending the steelworks, released an 18-second video in which he said he and other commanders were still inside the plant.\n\n\"A certain operation is going on, the details of which I will not disclose,\" he said.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said it had registered hundreds of prisoners from Azovstal now held by Russia, but it has not given a precise number.\n\nThe leader of Russian-backed separatists in control of the area said nearly half of the fighters remained inside the steelworks.

By early March, it had been surrounded by Russian forces, leaving residents facing dire shortages of food and water -- and constant bombardment that hit a maternity hospital and a theater where civilians were sheltering.\n\nThe plant: By mid-April, most of the last Ukrainian defenders were fighting to hold Russian forces back from the Azovstal steel plant -- which had also become a shelter for as many as 1,000 civilians, including some seriously injured who were stranded without medical care.\n\nIn late April, Russia claimed it had achieved the \"liberation\" of Mariupol -- which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denied, saying soldiers were still resisting in the city.\n\nEvacuation attempts: Evacuations of civilians from Azovstal began on May 1. On May 16, Ukraine's military said its forces had completed their \"combat mission\" at the steel plant, with hundreds of soldiers evacuated from the facility.\n\nHundreds of Ukrainian soldiers evacuated from the plant were taken to a pre-trial detention center, while the severely injured were receiving medical treatment, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.\n\nUkraine said it expects to carry out an exchange of Russian prisoners of war for the severely injured soldiers.\n\nThe situation on the ground: If true, Russia's claim on Friday would suggest the entire city of Mariupol has fallen to Russian control after nearly three months of brutal fighting.\n\nA spokesperson from the Russian Defense Ministry claimed the \"last group of 531 militants surrendered\" in the plant.

It would also deprive Ukraine of a vital port.\n\nThe city endured some of the worst suffering of the war. An estimated 100,000 people remained from a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Constant bombardment has left behind shattered and charred buildings in row after row of destroyed apartment blocks and ruined neighborhoods.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the facility.\n\nA week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600. Officials had written the word \"CHILDREN\" in Russian on the pavement outside to try to forestall an aerial attack.\n\nLong traffic jams of cars snaked out of the city, filled with evacuees fleeing past checkpoints of Russian soldiers with heavy weapons who didn't have time to search inside each vehicle in the convoys.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves near Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians. The imagery showed rows of graves stretching away from an existing cemetery in the town of Manhush, outside the port city.\n\nMariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko accused the Russians of \"hiding their military crimes\" in the mass graves and labeled it \"the new Babi Yar\" -- recalling the ravine in Kyiv where the Nazis massacred nearly 34,000 Ukrainian Jews during World War II.\n\nIt was not the first time Moscow has claimed to have captured Mariupol. At a joint appearance with his defense minister on April 21, Putin declared that \"the completion of combat work to liberate Mariupol is a success.\" Even though die-hard Ukrainian forces were still inside the Azovstal plant at that point, Putin ordered the military to seal off the complex \"so that not even a fly comes through.\"\n\nAfter continued bombardment, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on May 16 the evacuation of his forces from the bunkers and tunnels beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\n\"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive.

The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out in the plant, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire before their government ordered them to abandon its defense and save their lives.\n\nWives of fighters who held out at the steelworks spoke emotionally about what may have been their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello.

Border guards, police officers, and territorial defense squads formed shortly before the war supplemented their ranks.\n\nThe bulk of these forces were deployed to defend Mariupol, home to a strategically located port, at the start of the Russian invasion. Marines from the 36th brigade held the port and another large plant in Mariupol for more than a month, until they ran out of supplies and ammunition.\n\nThey moved to the Azovstal steel mill to join the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right, and some of them were captured by the Russians.\n\nIn announcing Azovstal's seizure, the Russian Defense Ministry's chief spokesman referred to the Azov Regiment's fighters as Nazis and said their commander was taken away in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred of him \"for numerous atrocities.\"\n\nNo evidence has surfaced of the regiment mistreating Ukrainian civilians, hundreds of whom sheltered underground with the fighters. The regiment released several videos taken inside Azovstal that showed their members interacting with the civilians and giving children sweets.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly made negative assertions about the Azov Regiment.\n\nThe National Guard unit grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that rose to bolster Ukraine's underfunded and questionably led military in the fight against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThat conflict broke out after massive protests drove Ukraine's Kremlin-leaning president from office.\n\nThe Azov Battalion drew its initial fighters from far-right circles and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. Its current members rejected accusations of nationalism and radicalism. Sviatoslav Palamar, the regiment's deputy commander, said in a recent interview from the steel mill that he preferred the term \"patriotism.\"\n\nAs Mariupol became a symbol of the suffering and resistance of Ukrainians after Russia invaded their country, Ukrainian officials repeatedly stressed the role the fighters at Azovstal played in defending the city and stymying Russian progress elsewhere.\n\n\"The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol have already performed a feat, drawing the elite forces of the Russian army onto themselves and significantly slowing down the advance of the Russians in the southeast,\" Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said.\n\nAfter the plant's defenders were instructed to end their fight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the move was proper and humane because \"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle.\"\n\nThe ruined seaside city and the outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian fighters whose persistence frustrated Russia's objective to capture Mariupol quickly are now irrevocably etched into Ukrainian history, regardless of the outcome of the war.\n\nThe defense of Mariupol \"will go down in history as Thermopylae of the 21st century,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's president, said as the fighters started leaving the plant.\n\n\"The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy's plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war.\"\n\nThermopylae is widely considered one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.

Others were said to be hospitalized.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defense and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nIn other developments Friday, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine and fighting raged in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday the evacuation of his forces from the miles of tunnels and bunkers beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- Zelenskyy said Russia should be made to pay for every home, school, hospital and business it destroys. He called on Ukraine's partners to seize Russian funds and property under their jurisdiction and use them to create a fund to compensate those who suffered.\n\nRussia \"would feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every shell that it has fired at us,\" he said in his nightly video address.\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\n-- Russian lawmakers proposed a bill to lift the age limit of 40 for Russians volunteering for military service. Currently, all Russian men 18 to 27 must undergo a year of service, though many get college deferments and other exemptions.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported Friday in the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking expanse of coal mines and factories.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces shelled the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway from multiple directions, taking aim at the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region,\" he said via email.\n\nMoscow's troops have also been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas, and at least 12 people were killed there on Friday, Haidai said. A school that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, was hit, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nBut he said the Russians took losses in the attack on Severodonetsk and were forced to retreat. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency Tass quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance, and with it completing Moscow's long-sought goal of controlling the city, home to a strategic seaport.\n\nUkraine's military this week told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe impact of Russia's declared victory on the broader war in Ukraine remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict, which began with the Russian invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base in Black Sea region of Odesa as well as significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn its morning operational report, the Ukrainian military general staff reported heavy fighting in much of eastern Ukraine, including the areas of Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nSince failing to reach and capture Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Russia focused its offensive in the country's eastern industrial heartland. The Russia-backed separatists have controlled parts of the Donbas region since 2014, and Moscow wants to expand the territory under its control.\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockkaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nAs the end drew near at the steel plant, wives of fighters who had held out told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, the wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she shared the words her husband wrote her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nThe wife of another fighter, Natalia Zaritskaya, said her husband reported earlier this week that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived and most were seriously wounded.\n\n\"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly,\" Zaritskaya said.\n\nThe seasize steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been a battleground for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters held out with the help of air drops of supplies, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant and save themselves.\n\nRussia said the Azov Regiment's commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred for him.\n\nNo evidence of Ukrainian antipathy toward the nationalist regiment has emerged. The Kremlin has seized on the regiment's far-right origins in its drive to to cast the invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial.\n\nCapturing Mariupol furthers Russia's quest to essentially create a land bridge from Russia via much of the Donbas area bordering Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe city's seizure also helps Russian leader Putin offset some stinging setbacks, including the failure to take over Kyiv, the sinking of the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea and continued resistance that has stalled the offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nWith Mariupol under Russian control, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in the city, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theater where civilians had taken cover.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAt one point in the siege, Pope Francis lamented that Mariupol had become a \"city of martyrs.\"\n\nAn estimated 100,000 of the 450,000 people who resided there before the war remain. Many, trapped by Russia's siege, were left without food, water and electricity.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the steel plant during humanitarian cease-fires. They spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nThe chief executive of Metinvest, a multinational company which owns the Azovstal plant and another steel mill, Ilyich, in Mariupol, spoke of the city's devastation in an interview published Saturday in Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to clean it (the city) up to hide their crimes,'' the newspaper quoted Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov as saying. \"The inhabitants are trying to make the city function, to make water supplies work again.\"\n\n\"But the sewer system is damaged, there has been flooding, and infections are feared\" from drinking the water, he said.\n\nThe Ilyich steelworks still has some intact infrastructure, but if the Russians try to get it running, Ukrainians will refuse to return to their jobs there, Ryzhenkov said.\n\n\"We will never work under Russian occupation,'' Ryzhenkov said.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

I believe that justice must be restored. There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency Tass quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly have tried to characterize the fighters who holed up in the Azovstal steel plant as neo-Nazis. Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance, and with it completing Moscow's long-sought goal of controlling the city, home to a strategic seaport.\n\nUkraine's military this week told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe impact of Russia's declared victory on the broader war in Ukraine remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict, which began with the Russian invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base in Black Sea region of Odesa as well as significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn its morning operational report, the Ukrainian military general staff reported heavy fighting in much of eastern Ukraine, including the areas of Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nSince failing to reach and capture Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Russia focused its offensive in the country's eastern industrial heartland. The Russia-backed separatists have controlled parts of the Donbas region since 2014, and Moscow wants to expand the territory under its control.\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockkaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nAs the end drew near at the steel plant, wives of fighters who had held out told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, the wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she shared the words her husband wrote her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nThe wife of another fighter, Natalia Zaritskaya, said her husband reported earlier this week that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived and most were seriously wounded.\n\n\"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly,\" Zaritskaya said.\n\nThe seasize steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been a battleground for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters held out with the help of air drops of supplies, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant and save themselves.\n\nRussia said the Azov Regiment's commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred for him.\n\nNo evidence of Ukrainian antipathy toward the nationalist regiment has emerged. The Kremlin has seized on the regiment's far-right origins in its drive to to cast the invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial.\n\nCapturing Mariupol furthers Russia's quest to essentially create a land bridge from Russia via much of the Donbas area bordering Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe city's seizure also helps Russian leader Putin offset some stinging setbacks, including the failure to take over Kyiv, the sinking of the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea and continued resistance that has stalled the offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nWith Mariupol under Russian control, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in the city, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theater where civilians had taken cover.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAt one point in the siege, Pope Francis lamented that Mariupol had become a \"city of martyrs.\"\n\nAn estimated 100,000 of the 450,000 people who resided there before the war remain. Many, trapped by Russia's siege, were left without food, water and electricity.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the steel plant during humanitarian cease-fires. They spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nThe chief executive of Metinvest, a multinational company which owns the Azovstal plant and another steel mill, Ilyich, in Mariupol, spoke of the city's devastation in an interview published Saturday in Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to clean it (the city) up to hide their crimes,'' the newspaper quoted Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov as saying. \"The inhabitants are trying to make the city function, to make water supplies work again.\"\n\n\"But the sewer system is damaged, there has been flooding, and infections are feared\" from drinking the water, he said.\n\nThe Ilyich steelworks still has some intact infrastructure, but if the Russians try to get it running, Ukrainians will refuse to return to their jobs there, Ryzhenkov said.\n\n\"We will never work under Russian occupation,'' Ryzhenkov said.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

Luhansk is part of the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking eastern expanse of coal mines and factories that Russian President Vladimir Putin is bent on capturing.\n\n\"The liberation of the Luhansk People's Republic is nearing completion,\" Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu declared, referring to the breakaway state proclaimed by pro-Moscow separatists in 2014 and recognized by the Kremlin.\n\nIn Mariupol, the strategic port in the southern corner of the Donbas, Russian troops worn down by their nearly three-month siege of the city may not get the time they need to regroup, Britain's Defense Ministry said.\n\nWith the battle winding down for the Azovstal steel plant that represented the last bastion of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol, Russia is continuing to pull back forces there, and their commanders are under pressure to quickly send them elsewhere in the Donbas, according to the British.\n\n\"That means that Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition,\" the ministry said.\n\nAn undisclosed number of Ukrainian soldiers remained at the Azovstal steel plant. Russia said more than 1,900 had surrendered in recent days. Also remaining at the plant were the bodies of soldiers who defended it while tying down Russian forces.\n\nDenis Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, which led the defense of the plant, called them \"fallen heroes.\"\n\n\"I hope soon relatives and the whole of Ukraine will be able to bury the fighters with honors,\" he said.\n\nWives of fighters who held out at the steelworks spoke emotionally about what may have been their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello.

Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nIn other developments:\n\nMeanwhile, fighting intensified deeper in the Donbas.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces were especially focused on the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway, the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The road is extremely important because it's the only connection to other regions of the country,\" he said via email. \"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region.\"\n\nRussian forces shelled the road constantly from multiple directions, but Ukrainian armored transports were still able to get through, Haidai added.\n\nMoscow's troops have been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas. One of Friday's attacks was on a school in Severodonetsk that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, Haidai said. Three adults were killed, he said on Telegram.\n\nTwelve people were killed in Severodonetsk, Haidai said. It was not immediately clear if that included the three at the school. In addition, more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nRussian forces now control 90 percent of Luhansk, but the attack on Severodonetsk failed -- \"the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated,\" Haidai said. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nPro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas for the past eight years and held a considerable swath of it before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. But the effort by Putin's troops to take more territory there has been slow-going.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, Britain's Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian forces elsewhere in Ukraine continued to blast away at targets, some of them civilian.\n\nIn the village of Velyka Kostromka, west of the Donbas, explosions in the middle of the night Thursday shook Iryna Martsyniuk's house to its foundations. Roof timbers splintered and windows shattered, sending shards of glass into a wall near three sleeping children.\n\n\"There were flashes everywhere,\" she said. \"There was smoke everywhere.\" She grabbed the children and ran toward the home's entrance, \"but the corridor wasn't there anymore. Instead, we saw the starry night.\"\n\nThey ran down the road to a neighbor's home, where they hid in the basement.\n\nAround 20 other houses were damaged and two people were lightly wounded, said Olha Shaytanova, head of the village.", "source": {"uri": "wpri.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WPRI.com"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.wpri.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2022/05/AP22140624116113.jpg?w=1280", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 18, "stanza_neu": 37, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 56, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049543838", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "12:39:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T12:39:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T12:39:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "url": "https://www.news-gazette.com/news/nation-world/explainer-who-were-mariupols-last-defenders/article_dea0b37e-fec9-5901-a7f1-6c2bfa14686d.html", "title": "EXPLAINER: Who were Mariupol's last defenders?", "body": "The Ukrainian forces who made a determined last stand in a Mariupol steel mill against Russian troops were a mixture of seasoned soldiers, border guards, a controversial national guard regiment and volunteers who took up arms in the weeks before Russia's invasion\n\nThe Ukrainian forces who made a determined last stand in a Mariupol steel mill against Russian troops were a mixture of seasoned soldiers, border guards, a controversial national guard regiment and volunteers who took up arms in the weeks before Russia's invasion.\n\nAs Russia announced it had completed its takeover of Mariupol with the surrender of the fighters who served as the final obstacle, Ukraine's government did not confirm the city's fall.

Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defense and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nIn other developments Friday, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine and fighting raged in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday the evacuation of his forces from the miles of tunnels and bunkers beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- Zelenskyy said Russia should be made to pay for every home, school, hospital and business it destroys. He called on Ukraine's partners to seize Russian funds and property under their jurisdiction and use them to create a fund to compensate those who suffered.\n\nRussia \"would feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every shell that it has fired at us,\" he said in his nightly video address.\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\n-- Russian lawmakers proposed a bill to lift the age limit of 40 for Russians volunteering for military service. Currently, all Russian men 18 to 27 must undergo a year of service, though many get college deferments and other exemptions.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported Friday in the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking expanse of coal mines and factories.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces shelled the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway from multiple directions, taking aim at the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region,\" he said via email.\n\nMoscow's troops have also been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas, and at least 12 people were killed there on Friday, Haidai said. A school that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, was hit, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nBut he said the Russians took losses in the attack on Severodonetsk and were forced to retreat. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

The village formerly occupied by Russian forces is back under Ukrainian control, albeit very close to the front line and under constant shelling.\n\nBy ELENA BECATOROS, OLEKSANDR STASHEVSKYI and CIARAN McQUILLAN - Associated Press\n\nPOKROVSK, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia claimed to have captured Mariupol on Friday in what would be its biggest victory yet in its war with Ukraine, after a nearly three-month siege that reduced much of the strategic port city to a smoking ruin, with over 20,000 civilians feared dead.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin the \"complete liberation\" of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol -- the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance -- and the city as a whole, spokesman Igor Konashenkov said.\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine.\n\nRussia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the ministry as saying a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters who had been holed up at the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday.\n\nAs they surrendered, the troops were taken prisoner by the Russians, and at least some were taken to a former penal colony. Others were said to be hospitalized.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defense and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nIn other developments Friday, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine and fighting raged in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday the evacuation of his forces from the miles of tunnels and bunkers beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- Zelenskyy said Russia should be made to pay for every home, school, hospital and business it destroys. He called on Ukraine's partners to seize Russian funds and property under their jurisdiction and use them to create a fund to compensate those who suffered.\n\nRussia \"would feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every shell that it has fired at us,\" he said in his nightly video address.\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\n-- Russian lawmakers proposed a bill to lift the age limit of 40 for Russians volunteering for military service. Currently, all Russian men 18 to 27 must undergo a year of service, though many get college deferments and other exemptions.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported Friday in the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking expanse of coal mines and factories.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces shelled the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway from multiple directions, taking aim at the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region,\" he said via email.\n\nMoscow's troops have also been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas, and at least 12 people were killed there on Friday, Haidai said. A school that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, was hit, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nBut he said the Russians took losses in the attack on Severodonetsk and were forced to retreat. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

Today it is needed more than ever,\" Zelenskiy tweeted.\n\nMoscow says Western arms deliveries for Kyiv, and the imposition of sanctions amount to a \"proxy war\" by the United States and its allies.\n\nThe Russian military said it had destroyed a major consignment of Western arms in Ukraine's Zhytomyr region, west of Kyiv, using sea-launched Kalibr cruise missiles.

There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency Tass quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly have tried to characterize the fighters who holed up in the Azovstal steel plant as neo-Nazis. Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance, and with it completing Moscow's long-sought goal of controlling the city, home to a strategic seaport.\n\nUkraine's military this week told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe end of the battle for Mariupol would help Putin offset some stinging setbacks, including the failure of Russian troops to take over Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, the sinking of the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea and the continued resistance that has stalled an offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe impact of Russia's declared victory on the broader war in Ukraine remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict, which began when Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base in the Black Sea region of Odesa as well as a significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn its morning operational report, the Ukrainian military general staff reported heavy fighting in much of eastern Ukraine, including the areas of Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nAfter failing to capture Kyiv, Russia focused its offensive on the country's eastern industrial heartland. The Russia-backed separatists have controlled parts of the Donbas region since 2014, and Moscow wants to expand the territory under its control.\n\nThe seizure of Mariupol furthers Russia's quest to essentially create a land bridge from Russia stretching through the Donbas region to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Saturday that Russia was working to restore the port and remove mines.\n\nUkraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, demanded anew that Russia pay \"in one way or another for everything it has destroyed in Ukraine. Every burned house. Every ruined school, ruined hospital. Each blown up house of culture and infrastructure facility. Every destroyed enterprise.\"\n\n\"Of course, the Russian state will not even recognize that it is an aggressor,\" he said in an address late Friday. \"But its recognition is not required.\"\n\nZelenskyy expressed gratitude to his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, who signed off Saturday on a fresh, $40 billion infusion of aid for the war-ravaged nation. Half of the funding provides military assistance.\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nAs the end drew near at the steel plant, wives of fighters who had held out told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, the wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she shared the words her husband wrote her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nThe seaside steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been a battleground for weeks. Drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, the dwindling group of outgunned fighters held out with the help of airdrops before their government ordered them to abandon the plant.\n\nZelenskyy revealed in an interview published Friday that Ukrainian helicopter pilots braved Russian anti-aircraft fire to ferry in medicine, food and water to the steel mill as well as to retrieve bodies and rescue wounded fighters.\n\nA \"very large\" number of the pilots died on their daring missions, he said. \"They are absolutely heroic people, who knew that it would be difficult, knew that to fly would be almost impossible,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nRussia claimed that the Azov Regiment's commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred for him, but no evidence of Ukrainian antipathy toward the nationalist regiment has emerged.\n\nThe Kremlin has seized on the regiment's far-right origins in its drive to cast the invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Russian authorities have threatened to put some of the steel mill's defenders on trial for alleged war crimes.\n\nWith Russia controlling the city, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in Mariupol, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theater where hundreds of civilians had taken cover.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAt one point in the siege, Pope Francis lamented that Mariupol had become a \"city of martyrs.\"\n\nAn estimated 100,000 of the 450,000 people who resided there before the war remain. Many, trapped by Russia's siege, were left without food, water and electricity.\n\nThe chief executive of Metinvest, a multinational company that owns the Azovstal plant and another steel mill, Ilyich, in Mariupol, spoke of the city's devastation in an interview published Saturday in Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to clean it (the city) up to hide their crimes,'' the newspaper quoted Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov as saying. \"The inhabitants are trying to make the city function, to make water supplies work again.\"\n\n\"But the sewer system is damaged, there has been flooding, and infections are feared\" from drinking the water, he said.\n\nThe Ilyich steelworks still has some intact infrastructure, but if the Russians try to get it running, Ukrainians will refuse to return to their jobs there, Ryzhenkov said.\n\n\"We will never work under Russian occupation,'' he said.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

Earlier in...\n\nThe Ukrainian forces who made a determined last stand in a Mariupol steel mill against Russian troops were a mixture of seasoned soldiers, border guards, a controversial national guard regiment and volunteers who took up arms in the weeks before Russia's invasion.\n\nAs Russia announced it had completed its takeover of Mariupol with the surrender of the fighters who served as the final obstacle, Ukraine's government did not confirm the city's fall. Earlier in the week, Ukrainian officials said its combantants in the Azovstal steel plant had completed their mission and were being evacuated, describing them as heroes who had fulfilled a grueling task.\n\nHere's a look at these Ukrainian forces, who were taken prisoner by the Russians as they left the plant, and what they accomplished:\n\nWHO WERE THE DEFENDERS OF MARIUPOL?\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters from the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nThe fighters who held out at Azovstal, for much of the nearly three-month siege of Mariupol with Ukrainian civilians who sought safety in the plant's underground bunkers and tunnels, came from a variety of different military and law enforcement units, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nThere was the Azov Regiment, which is part of Ukraine's National Guard; the 36th Special Marine Brigade of Ukraine's Naval Forces and the 12th brigade of the National Guard. Border guards, police officers, and territorial defense squads formed shortly before the war supplemented their ranks.\n\nThe bulk of these forces were deployed to defend Mariupol, home to a stategically located port, at the start of the Russian invasion. Marines from the 36th brigade held the port and another large plant in Mariupol for more than a month, until they ran out of supplies and ammunition.\n\nThey moved to the Azovstal steel mill to join the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right, and some of them were captured by the Russians.\n\nWHY DOES RUSSIA LABEL THEM 'NATIONALISTS'?\n\nIn announcing Azovstal's seizure, the Russian Defense Ministry's chief spokesman referred to the Azov Regiment's fighters as Nazis and said their commander was taken away in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred of him \"for numerous atrocities.\"\n\nNo evidence has surfaced of the regiment mistreating Ukrainian civilians, hundreds of whom sheltered underground with the fighters. The regiment released several videos taken inside Azovstal that showed their members interacting with the civilians and giving children sweets.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly made negative assertions about the Azov Regiment.\n\nThe National Guard unit grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that rose to bolster Ukraine's underfunded and questionably led military in the fight against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThat conflict broke out after massive protests drove Ukraine's Kremlin-leaning president from office.\n\nThe Azov Battalion drew its initial fighters from far-right circles and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. Its current members rejected accusations of nationalism and radicalism. Sviatoslav Palamar, the regiment's deputy commander, said in a recent interview from the steel mill that he preferred the term \"patriotism.\"\n\nWHAT DID THE DEFENDERS ACCOMPLISH?\n\nAs Mariupol became a symbol of the suffering and resistance of Ukrainians after Russia invaded their country, Ukrainian officials repeatedly stressed the role the fighters at Azovstal played in defending the city and stymying Russian progress elsewhere.\n\n\"The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol have already performed a feat, drawing the elite forces of the Russian army onto themselves and significantly slowing down the advance of the Russians in the southeast,\" Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said.\n\nAfter the plant's defenders were instructed to end their fight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the move was proper and humane because \"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle.\"\n\nThe ruined seaside city and the outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian fighters whose persistence frustrated Russia's objective to capture Mariupol quickly are now irrevocably etched into Ukrainian history, regardless of the outcome of the war.\n\nThe defense of Mariupol \"will go down in history as Thermopylae of the 21st century,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's president, said as the fighters started leaving the plant. \"The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy's plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war.\"\n\nThermopylae is widely considered one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing. They were killed to a man, including their king.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri": "federalnewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Federal News Network"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 26, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 36, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049260596", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "06:55:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T06:55:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T06:52:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6392157077789307, "url": "https://roanoke.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/russia-claims-to-have-taken-full-control-of-mariupol/article_e77fc6a9-554f-5916-b165-f4b7734c98d2.html", "title": "Russia claims to have taken full control of Mariupol", "body": "Residents live in the basement of a building used as bomb shelter in the village of Staryi Saltiv, east Kharkiv, Ukraine, Friday, May 20, 2022.

Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defense and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nIn other developments Friday, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine and fighting raged in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday the evacuation of his forces from the miles of tunnels and bunkers beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- Zelenskyy said Russia should be made to pay for every home, school, hospital and business it destroys. He called on Ukraine's partners to seize Russian funds and property under their jurisdiction and use them to create a fund to compensate those who suffered.\n\nRussia \"would feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every shell that it has fired at us,\" he said in his nightly video address.\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\n-- Russian lawmakers proposed a bill to lift the age limit of 40 for Russians volunteering for military service. Currently, all Russian men 18 to 27 must undergo a year of service, though many get college deferments and other exemptions.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported Friday in the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking expanse of coal mines and factories.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces shelled the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway from multiple directions, taking aim at the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region,\" he said via email.\n\nMoscow's troops have also been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas, and at least 12 people were killed there on Friday, Haidai said. A school that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, was hit, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nBut he said the Russians took losses in the attack on Severodonetsk and were forced to retreat. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

AP-Yonhap\n\nThe Ukrainian General Staff reported a high number of Russian attacks in the east and south of country on Saturday, following the fall of the port city of Mariupol to Russian attacks.\n\nMoscow's troops continue to target eastern Ukraine, where 11 attacks were repelled, the situation report said.\n\nA regional governor also said Ukraine's eastern Donbass region was experiencing heavy fighting, raising fears of further Russian advances following the capture of Mariupol and the Azovstal steelworks.\n\nThe eastern Ukrainian town of Sievierodonetsk has been under fire for days, with several dead and injured, according to the governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Hajday.\n\n\"The Russians are wiping out Sievierodonetsk like Mariupol,\" he said on Telegram, referring to aerial bombardments in the region.\n\nHowever, he dismissed claims by Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu that Moscow was on the verge of completely taking the Luhansk region, calling these \"nonsense.\"\n\nRussian armed forces are trying to gain complete control over the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk and secure a land corridor to the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014.\n\nSeizing Mariupol was an important advance in Russia's strategy.\n\nLate on?Friday, Moscow said it had taken control of the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, where the city's last 2,000 fighters had been holed up for months in underground bunkers at the sprawling industrial site.\n\nA still image taken from handout video made available on 21 May by the Russian Defence Ministry's press service shows Russian servicemen frisk the acting commander of the Ukrainian 36th Marine Brigade after he was being evacuated from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, Ukraine, 20 May.

He is considered Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest ally in Ukraine.\n\nNow, Russian troops are clearing mines from the area around the port to make it functional again, according to the Ukrainian military.\n\nBut despite Mariupol's fall, Zelensky said his army had inflicted serious damage on Russia's armed forces.\n\nUkraine has \"broken the backbone\" of the Russian army, Zelensky said in a television interview. \"They will not be able to get back on their feet for the next few years.\"\n\nKiev will take it all back, he said, adding that Ukraine would see a return to the front lines before February 24, when Russia invaded, as a victory.\n\nLater on Saturday, Zelensky said that Russia's economy was paying a high price for its continued aggression.\n\n\"Russia has sent virtually all its resources to destroy us,\" Zelensky said in a video address.\n\n\"Rising prices, devaluation of income, destruction of all the economic potential that has been created in Russia since the 2000s - all this does not stop the invaders yet.

Three people were killed in the town of Lyman alone, regional governor Pavlo Kirilenko wrote on Telegram.

They said that as of 9 p.m. local time(1800 GMT), there was still fighting in four unspecified locations.\n\nRussian forces were using aircraft, artillery, tanks, rockets, mortars and missiles along the entire front line to attack civilian structures and residential areas, the Ukrainians said in a Facebook post.

Others were said to be hospitalized.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defense and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nIn other developments Friday, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine and fighting raged in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday the evacuation of his forces from the miles of tunnels and bunkers beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- Zelenskyy said Russia should be made to pay for every home, school, hospital and business it destroys. He called on Ukraine's partners to seize Russian funds and property under their jurisdiction and use them to create a fund to compensate those who suffered.\n\nRussia \"would feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every shell that it has fired at us,\" he said in his nightly video address.\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\n-- Russian lawmakers proposed a bill to lift the age limit of 40 for Russians volunteering for military service. Currently, all Russian men 18 to 27 must undergo a year of service, though many get college deferments and other exemptions.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported Friday in the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking expanse of coal mines and factories.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces shelled the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway from multiple directions, taking aim at the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region,\" he said via email.\n\nMoscow's troops have also been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas, and at least 12 people were killed there on Friday, Haidai said. A school that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, was hit, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nBut he said the Russians took losses in the attack on Severodonetsk and were forced to retreat. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

As Russia announced it had completed its takeover of Mariupol with the surrender of the fighters who served as the final obstacle, Ukraine's government did not confirm the city's fall.\n\nEarlier in the week, Ukrainian officials said its combatants in the Azovstal steel plant had completed their mission and were being evacuated, describing them as heroes who had fulfilled a gruelling task.\n\nHere's a look at these Ukrainian forces, who were taken prisoner by the Russians as they left the plant, and what they accomplished:\n\nWHO WERE THE DEFENDERS OF MARIUPOL?\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters from the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nThe fighters who held out at Azovstal, for much of the nearly three-month siege of Mariupol with Ukrainian civilians who sought safety in the plant's underground bunkers and tunnels, came from a variety of different military and law enforcement units, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nThere was the Azov Regiment, which is part of Ukraine's National Guard; the 36th Special Marine Brigade of Ukraine's Naval Forces and the 12th brigade of the National Guard. Border guards, police officers, and territorial defense squads formed shortly before the war supplemented their ranks.\n\nThe bulk of these forces were deployed to defend Mariupol, home to a stategically located port, at the start of the Russian invasion. Marines from the 36th brigade held the port and another large plant in Mariupol for more than a month, until they ran out of supplies and ammunition.\n\nThey moved to the Azovstal steel mill to join the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right, and some of them were captured by the Russians.\n\nWHY DOES RUSSIA LABEL THEM NATIONALISTS'?\n\nIn announcing Azovstal's seizure, the Russian Defense Ministry's chief spokesman referred to the Azov Regiment's fighters as Nazis and said their commander was taken away in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred of him \"for numerous atrocities.\"\n\nNo evidence has surfaced of the regiment mistreating Ukrainian civilians, hundreds of whom sheltered underground with the fighters. The regiment released several videos taken inside Azovstal that showed their members interacting with the civilians and giving children sweets.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly made negative assertions about the Azov Regiment.\n\nThe National Guard unit grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that rose to bolster Ukraine's underfunded and questionably led military in the fight against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThat conflict broke out after massive protests drove Ukraine's Kremlin-leaning president from office.\n\nThe Azov Battalion drew its initial fighters from far-right circles and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. Its current members rejected accusations of nationalism and radicalism.\n\nSviatoslav Palamar, the regiment's deputy commander, said in a recent interview from the steel mill that he preferred the term \"patriotism.\"\n\nWHAT DID THE DEFENDERS ACCOMPLISH?\n\nAs Mariupol became a symbol of the suffering and resistance of Ukrainians after Russia invaded their country, Ukrainian officials repeatedly stressed the role the fighters at Azovstal played in defending the city and stymying Russian progress elsewhere.\n\n\"The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol have already performed a feat, drawing the elite forces of the Russian army onto themselves and significantly slowing down the advance of the Russians in the southeast,\" Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said.\n\nAfter the plant's defenders were instructed to end their fight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the move was proper and humane because \"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle.\"\n\nThe ruined seaside city and the outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian fighters whose persistence frustrated Russia's objective to capture Mariupol quickly are now irrevocably etched into Ukrainian history, regardless of the outcome of the war.\n\nThe defense of Mariupol \"will go down in history as Thermopylae of the 21st century,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's president, said as the fighters started leaving the plant.\n\n\"The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy's plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war.\"\n\nThermopylae is widely considered one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.

I believe that justice must be restored. There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency Tass quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly have tried to characterize the fighters who holed up in the Azovstal steel plant as neo-Nazis. Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance, and with it completing Moscow's long-sought goal of controlling the city, home to a strategic seaport.\n\nUkraine's military this week told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe impact of Russia's declared victory on the broader war in Ukraine remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict, which began with the Russian invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base in Black Sea region of Odesa as well as significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn its morning operational report, the Ukrainian military general staff reported heavy fighting in much of eastern Ukraine, including the areas of Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nSince failing to reach and capture Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Russia focused its offensive in the country's eastern industrial heartland. The Russia-backed separatists have controlled parts of the Donbas region since 2014, and Moscow wants to expand the territory under its control.\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockkaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nAs the end drew near at the steel plant, wives of fighters who had held out told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, the wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she shared the words her husband wrote her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nThe wife of another fighter, Natalia Zaritskaya, said her husband reported earlier this week that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived and most were seriously wounded.\n\n\"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly,\" Zaritskaya said.\n\nThe seasize steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been a battleground for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters held out with the help of air drops of supplies, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant and save themselves.\n\nRussia said the Azov Regiment's commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred for him.\n\nNo evidence of Ukrainian antipathy toward the nationalist regiment has emerged. The Kremlin has seized on the regiment's far-right origins in its drive to to cast the invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial.\n\nCapturing Mariupol furthers Russia's quest to essentially create a land bridge from Russia via much of the Donbas area bordering Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe city's seizure also helps Russian leader Putin offset some stinging setbacks, including the failure to take over Kyiv, the sinking of the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea and continued resistance that has stalled the offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nWith Mariupol under Russian control, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in the city, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theater where civilians had taken cover.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAt one point in the siege, Pope Francis lamented that Mariupol had become a \"city of martyrs.\"\n\nAn estimated 100,000 of the 450,000 people who resided there before the war remain. Many, trapped by Russia's siege, were left without food, water and electricity.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the steel plant during humanitarian cease-fires. They spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nThe chief executive of Metinvest, a multinational company which owns the Azovstal plant and another steel mill, Ilyich, in Mariupol, spoke of the city's devastation in an interview published Saturday in Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to clean it (the city) up to hide their crimes,'' the newspaper quoted Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov as saying. \"The inhabitants are trying to make the city function, to make water supplies work again.\"\n\n\"But the sewer system is damaged, there has been flooding, and infections are feared\" from drinking the water, he said.\n\nThe Ilyich steelworks still has some intact infrastructure, but if the Russians try to get it running, Ukrainians will refuse to return to their jobs there, Ryzhenkov said.\n\n\"We will never work under Russian occupation,'' Ryzhenkov said.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

The war has caused global prices for grains, cooking oils, fuel and fertiliser to soar.\n\nThe EU said it is looking into ways of using the frozen assets of Russian oligarchs to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, while the United States has not ruled out possibly placing sanctions on countries that purchase Russian oil.\n\nThe past week has seen Russia secure its biggest victory since the invasion began, with the Kyiv government ordering the defenders of a steelworks in Mariupol to stand down after a protracted siege.\n\nBritish military intelligence said as many as 1,700 soldiers were likely to have surrendered at the Azovstal steel factory, matching a similar number released on Thursday by Moscow.\n\nUkrainian officials, who have tried to arrange a prisoner swap, have declined to comment on the number, saying it could endanger rescue efforts.\n\nLate on Thursday, Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy head of the Azov Regiment defending the steelworks, released an 18-second video in which he said he and other commanders were still inside the plant.\n\n\"A certain operation is going on, the details of which I will not disclose,\" he said.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said it had registered hundreds of prisoners from Azovstal now held by Russia, but it has not given a precise number.\n\nThe leader of Russian-backed separatists in control of the area said nearly half of the fighters remained inside the steelworks.\n\nThe wounded were given medical treatment while those who were fit were taken to a penal colony and were being treated well, he said.", "source": {"uri": "newsinfo.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@newsinfo.inquirer.net", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/files/2022/05/2022-05-19T224209Z_1_LYNXNPEI4I12P_RTROPTP_4_UKRAINE-CRISIS-DONETSK-620x466.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.4666666666666667, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 8, "stanza_neu": 24, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 33, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049679014", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "15:27:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T15:27:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T13:56:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6313725709915161, "url": "https://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/russia-halts-gas-flow-to-finland-says-mariupol-steelworks-siege-has-ended/", "title": "Russia halts gas flow to Finland, says Mariupol steelworks siege has ended - SABC News - Breaking news, special reports, world, business, sport coverage of all South African current events.

Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance, and with it completing Moscow's long-sought goal of controlling the city, home to a strategic seaport.\n\nUkraine's military this week told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe impact of Russia's declared victory on the broader war in Ukraine remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict, which began with the Russian invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base in Black Sea region of Odesa as well as significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region.

Others were said to be hospitalized. The defence of the steel mill had been led by Ukraine's Azov Regiment. Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armoured vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defence and save themselves.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nIn other developments Friday, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine, and fighting raged in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing. Russian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theatre where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.", "source": {"uri": "newsofbahrain.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DT News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.newsofbahrain.com/admin/post/upload/A_Ah3vgUx8F1_2022-05-21_1653114391resized_pic.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 9, "stanza_neu": 14, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 23, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049574154", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "13:16:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T13:16:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T12:35:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6313725709915161, "url": "https://arynews.tv/russia-claims-victory-mariupol-azovstal-steel-plant-siege/", "title": "Russia claims victory in Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant siege", "body": "KYIV/OSLO: Russia claimed victory in a months-long battle for Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant, taking it a step nearer to its goal of controlling Ukraine's Donbas region.\n\nRussia also launched what appeared to be a major assault to seize the last remaining Ukrainian-held territory in Luhansk, one of two provinces that make up the southeastern Donbas region and where Russian-backed separatists already controlled swathes of territory before the Feb. 24 invasion.\n\nThe last Ukrainian forces holed up in Mariupol's smashed Azovstal steelworks surrendered on Friday, Russia's defense ministry said, ending the bloodiest siege of the war.\n\n\"The territory of the Azovstal metallurgical plant ... has been completely liberated,\" the ministry said in a statement, adding that 2,439 defenders had surrendered in the past few days, including 531 in the final group.\n\nHours earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine's military had told the last defenders at the steelworks they could get out and save their lives.

I believe that justice must be restored. There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency Tass quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly have tried to characterize the fighters who holed up in the Azovstal steel plant as neo-Nazis. Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance, and with it completing Moscow's long-sought goal of controlling the city, home to a strategic seaport.\n\nUkraine's military this week told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe impact of Russia's declared victory on the broader war in Ukraine remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict, which began with the Russian invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base in Black Sea region of Odesa as well as significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn its morning operational report, the Ukrainian military general staff reported heavy fighting in much of eastern Ukraine, including the areas of Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nSince failing to reach and capture Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Russia focused its offensive in the country's eastern industrial heartland. The Russia-backed separatists have controlled parts of the Donbas region since 2014, and Moscow wants to expand the territory under its control.\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockkaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nAs the end drew near at the steel plant, wives of fighters who had held out told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, the wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she shared the words her husband wrote her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nThe wife of another fighter, Natalia Zaritskaya, said her husband reported earlier this week that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived and most were seriously wounded.\n\n\"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly,\" Zaritskaya said.\n\nThe seasize steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been a battleground for weeks.

It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe end of the battle for Mariupol would help Putin offset some stinging setbacks, including the failure of Russian troops to take over Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, the sinking of the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea and the continued resistance that has stalled an offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nIt also furthers Russia's quest to essentially create a land bridge from Russia stretching through the Donbas region to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe impact on the broader war remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base in the Black Sea region of Odesa as well as a significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn its morning operational report, the Ukrainian military general staff reported heavy fighting in much of eastern Ukraine, including the areas of Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said that Russia is expected to relaunch an offensive on the strategically important city of Sloviansk, in the Donetsk region. The city is critical to Russia's objective of capturing all of eastern Ukraine and saw fierce fighting last month after Moscow's troops backed off from Kyiv.", "source": {"uri": "whyy.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WHYY"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AP22141398048661.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 18, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 22, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049241226", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "06:24:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T06:24:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T06:11:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "url": "https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-foreign-agent-kasparov-khodorkovsky/31861022.html", "title": "Russia Adds Chess Champion Kasparov, Former Tycoon Khodorkovsky To 'Foreign Agents' Registry", "body": "Russia Claims All Ukrainian Troops Out Of Steelworks In Mariupol\n\nRussian troops are in full control of the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol and all Ukrainian fighters that had been holed up there have surrendered, the Russian Defense Ministry says, as Moscow intensifies its assault on eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"The territory of the Azovstal metallurgical plant...has been completely liberated,\" the ministry said in a statement on May 20.\n\nIt said 531 people were in the group that gave up most recently and that brought to 2,439 the total number of defenders who had surrendered in the past few days.\n\nThe full abandonment of the bunkers and tunnels of the plant brings an end to most destructive siege of the war that started nearly three months ago.\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine, but President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said earlier that the Azovstal defenders got a clear signal from military command that they could get out and save their lives.\n\nRussia had sought control of Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, to complete a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it annexed in 2014, and to free up troops to join the battle for control of the Donbas region.\n\nRussia has intensified its assault on the region, relentlessly pounding it into what Zelenskiy says now resembles \"hell.\"\n\nAfter more than 12 weeks of fighting since Moscow launched its invasion, Ukrainian authorities said that \"massive\" artillery barrages by Russian forces continued to target civilian infrastructure, including residential districts.\n\nZelenskiy on May 20 sharply criticized one of those attacks, which struck a Ukrainian cultural center in the Kharkiv region.\n\nKharkiv regional Governor Oleg Sinegubov said eight people had been wounded, including an 11-year-old girl. A local health official had earlier put the number of wounded at seven.\n\nZelenskiy released a video on social media showing a large explosion hitting the newly renovated Palace of Culture in Lozova. The building was partly destroyed, and the roof caught fire, Ukraine's emergency services reported.\n\n\"The occupiers identified culture, education, and humanity as their enemies,\" Zelenskiy said. \"What is in the minds of people who choose such targets? Absolute evil, absolute stupidity.\"\n\nSinegubov said there was no doubt the Russian forces targeted the cultural center, adding on Telegram that two of three missiles fired had been intercepted and the blaze that broke out at the center had been extinguished.\n\nBritish intelligence on May 20 noted in its daily report on the situation in Ukraine that after securing the strategic Sea of Azov port following a monthslong siege that turned the city into ruins and killed thousands of civilians, Moscow is likely to redeploy troops to aid in the offensive in the east.\n\nWATCH: The widow of a Ukrainian civilian killed by the first Russian soldier on trial for war crimes in Ukraine said he could have \"missed\" her husband instead of carrying out orders. The Russian soldier accused of killing him pleaded guilty in a Kyiv court on May 18.\n\nThose soldiers who left Azovstal, including those who were wounded, were reportedly transferred to territory in eastern Ukraine that is controlled by Kremlin-backed separatists.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has said it is registering the hundreds of Ukrainian fighters who left the Azovstal plant in Mariupol as prisoners of war (POWs).\n\nThe ICRC says the registration of the fighters as POWs was \"critical to ensure they're accounted for & treated humanely and with dignity\" and allows the organization to track those who have been captured and help them keep in touch with their families.\n\nKyiv has expressed hope that the fighters will be exchanged for Russian prisoners, but separatist authorities in the eastern Donetsk region suggested some of them could be put on trial.\n\nIn southeastern Ukraine, an estimated 1,000 vehicles carrying Ukrainian civilians were prevented from crossing into Ukrainian-held territory in Zaporizhzhya. The regional military administration said on May 20 that cars full of people trying to evacuate were stuck at a Russian checkpoint in the city of Vasylivka.\n\n\"In Vasylivka, the occupiers have not allowed more than 1,000 cars to enter the territory controlled by Ukraine for the fourth day in a row,\" the administration said in a Telegram post, adding that there are women and children in the cars, and that most of them no longer have money for food and water.\n\nIn Luhansk, local authorities said on May 20 that indiscriminate Russian bombardment had killed at least 13 civilians over the past 24 hours and caused substantial damage.\n\nTwelve people were killed in the town of Severodonesk, where a Russian assault has been unsuccessful, said the regional governor, Serhiy Hayday.

Desna is some 70 kilometers from the border with Belarus.\n\nZelenskiy spoke on May 19 with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about a range of issues, including financial aid to assist the shattered Ukrainian economy, agricultural exports, and \"the evacuation of our heroes from Azovstal.\"\n\nShoigu said on May 20 that the \"liberation of the Luhansk People's Republic\" -- a territory in Ukraine recognized by Russia as independent and controlled by Moscow-backed separatists -- would be completed soon.\n\nThe minister also said Russia would beef up its western defenses with troops and 12 additional military bases in response to Sweden and Finland's bid to join NATO.\n\nThe two Nordic countries shed their longtime neutrality this week by formally submitting applications to join the alliance, saying the move was necessary because of security concerns sparked by Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://gdb.rferl.org/1839021B-8CB4-4429-AA16-B0681521FDA1_cx0_cy11_cw99_w1200_r1.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 15, "stanza_neu": 25, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 41, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049184235", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "05:01:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T05:01:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T05:00:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "url": "https://omaha.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/russia-claims-to-have-taken-full-control-of-mariupol/article_688f8499-a577-507a-8434-776450e49b38.html", "title": "Russia claims to have taken full control of Mariupol", "body": "Residents live in the basement of a building used as bomb shelter in the village of Staryi Saltiv, east Kharkiv, Ukraine, Friday, May 20, 2022.

Others were said to be hospitalized.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defense and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nIn other developments Friday, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine and fighting raged in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday the evacuation of his forces from the miles of tunnels and bunkers beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- Zelenskyy said Russia should be made to pay for every home, school, hospital and business it destroys. He called on Ukraine's partners to seize Russian funds and property under their jurisdiction and use them to create a fund to compensate those who suffered.\n\nRussia \"would feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every shell that it has fired at us,\" he said in his nightly video address.\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\n-- Russian lawmakers proposed a bill to lift the age limit of 40 for Russians volunteering for military service. Currently, all Russian men 18 to 27 must undergo a year of service, though many get college deferments and other exemptions.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported Friday in the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking expanse of coal mines and factories.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces shelled the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway from multiple directions, taking aim at the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region,\" he said via email.\n\nMoscow's troops have also been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas, and at least 12 people were killed there on Friday, Haidai said. A school that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, was hit, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nBut he said the Russians took losses in the attack on Severodonetsk and were forced to retreat. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

'They'll start a new offensive, even more bloody and large-scale,' Podolyak added.\n\nPro-Russian separatists have fought Ukraine for control of the Luhansk and Donetsk provinces - which together make up the Donbas - since 2014, when Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula.\n\nUkrainian forces in the two provinces said via Facebook that at least seven people had been killed in Donetsk in the previous 24 hours when Russians, using aircraft, artillery, tanks, rockets, mortars and missiles, pummeled civilian structures and residential areas, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Ukrainians said they had turned back nine attacks, destroying five tanks and 10 armored vehicles, according to the Facebook post.\n\n'The situation in Donbas is extremely difficult,' Zelenskyy said Saturday in his nightly address. He said Ukrainian forces were holding off the Russian army as it was trying to attack the cities of Sloviansk and Sievierodonetsk.\n\nOn Friday night Zelenskyy said that victory against Russia will ultimately come through a diplomatic settlement.\n\nA wedding photograph lies among rubble from a Russian strike earlier in the war in Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine, May 21, 2022.\n\n\"The victory will be difficult, it will be bloody and in battle, but its end will be in diplomacy.

He said Ukraine's intelligence service is making preparations \"for a dialogue and an exchange.'\n\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly three months ago, on Feb. 24.\n\nConcern for the treatment of those fighters increased Saturday when Denis Pushilin, the pro-Kremlin head of an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, said they would face tribunals.\n\nPushilin said there were 2,439 people in custody, including some foreign nationals among the fighters.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Saturday that Ukraine would fight for the return of every soldier.\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine that Mariupol was fully under Russian control.\n\nThe port city is the scene of the war's bloodiest siege, with Russian forces bombarding it for nearly three months. Much of Mariupol has been reduced to rubble, and more than 20,000 civilians are feared dead.\n\nBut its capture adds to Moscow's goal of a land route from Russia to the Crimea and perhaps beyond.\n\nRussia destroyed a Ukrainian special operations base near Odesa, Ukraine's main Black Sea port on Saturday, as well as a significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region, The Associated Press reported, quoting Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nDestroyed trams stand in a depot in Mariupol, in territory under the government of the Donetsk People's Republic, eastern Ukraine, May 21, 2022.\n\nThe end of the fighting in Mariupol not only gives Russian President Vladimir Putin a victory, but it allows him to shift fighters east to the Donbas.\n\nAmong the developments there:\n\nThe only functioning hospital in Sievierodonetsk, the main city under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk region, has three doctors left and enough supplies for 10 days, Gov.

[@IAPonomarenko Twitter]\n\nThe last Ukrainian forces holed up in Mariupol's smashed Azovstal steelworks surrendered on Friday (20 May), Russia's defense ministry said, ending the most destructive siege of the war as Moscow fought to cement control over the Donbas region.\n\nHours before Russia's announcement on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the last defenders at the steelworks had been told by Ukraine's military that they could get out and save their lives.\n\nRussia said there were 531 members of the last group that had given up. \"The territory of the Azovstal metallurgical plant... has been completely liberated,\" the ministry said in a statement, adding that a total of 2,439 defenders had surrendered in the past few days.\n\nThe Ukrainians did not immediately confirm those figures.\n\nRussia also launched what appeared to be a major assault to seize the last remaining Ukrainian-held territory in the province of Luhansk, one of two southeastern Ukrainian provinces Moscow proclaims as independent states.\n\n\"The Russian army has started very intensive destruction of the town of Sievierodonetsk, the intensity of shelling doubled, they are shelling residential quarters, destroying house by house,\" Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said on his Telegram channel.\n\n\"We do not know how many people died, because it is simply impossible to go through and look at every apartment,\" he said.\n\nThe city of Sievierodonetsk and its twin Lyshchansk across the Siverskiy Donets river form the eastern part of a Ukrainian-held pocket Russia has been trying to overrun since mid-April after failing to capture the capital Kyiv.\n\nUkraine's general staff said it had pushed back an offensive on Sievierodonetsk, part of what it described as major Russian operations along a stretch of the frontline.\n\nDespite losing ground elsewhere in recent weeks, Russian forces have advanced on the Luhansk front, in what some military analysts view as a major push to achieve scaled-down war aims of capturing more territory claimed by pro-Russian rebels.\n\n\"This will be the critical next few weeks of the conflict,\" said Mathieu Boulegue, an expert at London's Chatham House think tank. \"And it depends on how effective they are at conquering Sievierodonetsk and the lands across it.\"\n\nIn Moscow, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the \"liberation of the Luhansk People's Republic\" would be over soon.\n\nThe end of the Mariupol siege was an important symbolic moment for Russia, after a series of setbacks since the invasion began on 24 February, but it came at the cost of massive destruction.\n\nZelenskyy described the conditions in the Donbas, which includes Luhansk and the neighbouring Donetsk province where Mariupol is located, as \"hell\" and said the region had been \"completely destroyed\" by Russia.\n\nCapturing Luhansk and Donetsk would allow Moscow to claim a victory after announcing last month that this was now its objective. It achieved a major step towards that goal this week, when Ukraine ordered the garrison in Mariupol, the main Donbas port, to stand down.\n\nNatalia Zarytska, wife of an Azovstal fighter who surrendered, said she had not heard from him since a Telegram message exchange two days ago. She believed he was still alive.\n\n\"The situation is really hard and horrible and my husband is on the way from one hell to another hell, from Azovstal steel plant to a prison, to captivity,\" Zarytska said in Istanbul, where she and other relatives lobbied Turkey to help save the fighters.\n\nThe Red Cross said it has registered hundreds of Ukrainians who surrendered at the plant as prisoners of war and Kyiv says it wants a prisoner swap.

Others were said to be hospitalized.\n\nThe defense of the steel mill had been led by Ukraine's Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast its invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armoured vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them ''Nazis'' and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometers, had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defense and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on February 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday the evacuation of his forces from the miles of tunnels and bunkers beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: ''Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.'' Natalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\" She said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as ''the Thermopylae of the 21st century'' -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 BC before finally succumbing.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/11_03_2020_13_25_10_8590644.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 14, "stanza_neu": 20, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 34, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049782151", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "17:44:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T17:44:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T17:44:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "url": "https://www.breakingnews.ie/ukraine/wrapup-5-russia-halts-gas-flow-to-finland-intensifies-push-for-donbas-1308673.html", "title": "Russia halts gas flow to Finland, intensifies push for Donbas | BreakingNews.ie", "body": "Russia stopped providing gas to Finland in an escalation of a row over energy payments with the West on Saturday, and intensified an offensive in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.\n\nAfter ending weeks of resistance by the last Ukrainian fighters in the strategic southeastern city of Mariupol, Russia is waging what appears to be a major offensive in Luhansk, one of two provinces in Donbas.\n\nRussian-backed separatists already controlled swathes of territory in Luhansk and the neighbouring Donetsk province before the February 24th invasion, but Moscow wants to seize the last remaining Ukrainian-held territory in Donbas.\n\nThe end of fighting in Mariupol, the biggest city Russia has captured so far, could be crucial to that ambition and gives Russian president Vladimir Putin a rare victory after a series of setbacks in nearly three months of combat.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy told local television that while the fighting would be bloody, and victory difficult, the end would come only through diplomacy.\n\n\"For them, all these victories - the occupation of Crimea or Donbas - is very temporary.

Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance, and with it completing Moscow's long-sought goal of controlling the city, home to a strategic seaport.\n\nUkraine's military this week told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe impact of Russia's declared victory on the broader war in Ukraine remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict, which began with the Russian invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base in Black Sea region of Odesa as well as significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn its morning operational report, the Ukrainian military general staff reported heavy fighting in much of eastern Ukraine, including the areas of Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nSince failing to reach and capture Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Russia focused its offensive in the country's eastern industrial heartland. The Russia-backed separatists have controlled parts of the Donbas region since 2014, and Moscow wants to expand the territory under its control.\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockkaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nAs the end drew near at the steel plant, wives of fighters who had held out told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, the wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she shared the words her husband wrote her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nThe wife of another fighter, Natalia Zaritskaya, said her husband reported earlier this week that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived and most were seriously wounded.\n\n\"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly,\" Zaritskaya said.\n\nThe seasize steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been a battleground for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters held out with the help of air drops of supplies, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant and save themselves.\n\nRussia said the Azov Regiment's commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred for him.\n\nNo evidence of Ukrainian antipathy toward the nationalist regiment has emerged. The Kremlin has seized on the regiment's far-right origins in its drive to to cast the invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial.\n\nCapturing Mariupol furthers Russia's quest to essentially create a land bridge from Russia via much of the Donbas area bordering Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe city's seizure also helps Russian leader Putin offset some stinging setbacks, including the failure to take over Kyiv, the sinking of the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea and continued resistance that has stalled the offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nWith Mariupol under Russian control, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in the city, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theater where civilians had taken cover.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAt one point in the siege, Pope Francis lamented that Mariupol had become a \"city of martyrs.\"\n\nAn estimated 100,000 of the 450,000 people who resided there before the war remain. Many, trapped by Russia's siege, were left without food, water and electricity.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the steel plant during humanitarian cease-fires. They spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nThe chief executive of Metinvest, a multinational company which owns the Azovstal plant and another steel mill, Ilyich, in Mariupol, spoke of the city's devastation in an interview published Saturday in Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to clean it (the city) up to hide their crimes,'' the newspaper quoted Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov as saying. \"The inhabitants are trying to make the city function, to make water supplies work again.\"\n\n\"But the sewer system is damaged, there has been flooding, and infections are feared\" from drinking the water, he said.\n\nThe Ilyich steelworks still has some intact infrastructure, but if the Russians try to get it running, Ukrainians will refuse to return to their jobs there, Ryzhenkov said.\n\n\"We will never work under Russian occupation,'' Ryzhenkov said.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance, and with it completing Moscow's long-sought goal of controlling the city, home to a strategic seaport.\n\nUkraine's military this week told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe impact of Russia's declared victory on the broader war in Ukraine remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict, which began with the Russian invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base in Black Sea region of Odesa as well as significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn its morning operational report, the Ukrainian military general staff reported heavy fighting in much of eastern Ukraine, including the areas of Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nSince failing to reach and capture Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Russia focused its offensive in the country's eastern industrial heartland. The Russia-backed separatists have controlled parts of the Donbas region since 2014, and Moscow wants to expand the territory under its control.\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockkaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nAs the end drew near at the steel plant, wives of fighters who had held out told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, the wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she shared the words her husband wrote her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nThe wife of another fighter, Natalia Zaritskaya, said her husband reported earlier this week that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived and most were seriously wounded.\n\n\"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly,\" Zaritskaya said.\n\nThe seasize steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been a battleground for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters held out with the help of air drops of supplies, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant and save themselves.\n\nRussia said the Azov Regiment's commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred for him.\n\nNo evidence of Ukrainian antipathy toward the nationalist regiment has emerged. The Kremlin has seized on the regiment's far-right origins in its drive to to cast the invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial.\n\nCapturing Mariupol furthers Russia's quest to essentially create a land bridge from Russia via much of the Donbas area bordering Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe city's seizure also helps Russian leader Putin offset some stinging setbacks, including the failure to take over Kyiv, the sinking of the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea and continued resistance that has stalled the offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nWith Mariupol under Russian control, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in the city, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theater where civilians had taken cover.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAt one point in the siege, Pope Francis lamented that Mariupol had become a \"city of martyrs.\"\n\nAn estimated 100,000 of the 450,000 people who resided there before the war remain. Many, trapped by Russia's siege, were left without food, water and electricity.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the steel plant during humanitarian cease-fires. They spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nThe chief executive of Metinvest, a multinational company which owns the Azovstal plant and another steel mill, Ilyich, in Mariupol, spoke of the city's devastation in an interview published Saturday in Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to clean it (the city) up to hide their crimes,'' the newspaper quoted Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov as saying. \"The inhabitants are trying to make the city function, to make water supplies work again.\"\n\n\"But the sewer system is damaged, there has been flooding, and infections are feared\" from drinking the water, he said.\n\nThe Ilyich steelworks still has some intact infrastructure, but if the Russians try to get it running, Ukrainians will refuse to return to their jobs there, Ryzhenkov said.\n\n\"We will never work under Russian occupation,'' Ryzhenkov said.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

He said on Russian state TV that the figure includes some foreign nationals, though he did not provide further details.\n\nFamily members of the steel mill fighters, who authorities say came from a variety of military and law enforcement units, have pleaded for them to be given rights as prisoners of war and eventually returned to Ukraine.

Earlier in the week, Ukrainian officials said its combantants in the Azovstal steel plant had completed their mission and were being evacuated, describing them as heroes who had fulfilled a grueling task.\n\nHere's a look at these Ukrainian forces, who were taken prisoner by the Russians as they left the plant, and what they accomplished:\n\nWHO WERE THE DEFENDERS OF MARIUPOL?\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters from the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nThe fighters who held out at Azovstal, for much of the nearly three-month siege of Mariupol with Ukrainian civilians who sought safety in the plant's underground bunkers and tunnels, came from a variety of different military and law enforcement units, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nThere was the Azov Regiment, which is part of Ukraine's National Guard; the 36th Special Marine Brigade of Ukraine's Naval Forces and the 12th brigade of the National Guard. Border guards, police officers, and territorial defense squads formed shortly before the war supplemented their ranks.\n\nThe bulk of these forces were deployed to defend Mariupol, home to a stategically located port, at the start of the Russian invasion. Marines from the 36th brigade held the port and another large plant in Mariupol for more than a month, until they ran out of supplies and ammunition.\n\nThey moved to the Azovstal steel mill to join the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right, and some of them were captured by the Russians.\n\nWHY DOES RUSSIA LABEL THEM 'NATIONALISTS'?\n\nIn announcing Azovstal's seizure, the Russian Defense Ministry's chief spokesman referred to the Azov Regiment's fighters as Nazis and said their commander was taken away in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred of him \"for numerous atrocities.\"\n\nNo evidence has surfaced of the regiment mistreating Ukrainian civilians, hundreds of whom sheltered underground with the fighters. The regiment released several videos taken inside Azovstal that showed their members interacting with the civilians and giving children sweets.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly made negative assertions about the Azov Regiment.\n\nThe National Guard unit grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that rose to bolster Ukraine's underfunded and questionably led military in the fight against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThat conflict broke out after massive protests drove Ukraine's Kremlin-leaning president from office.\n\nThe Azov Battalion drew its initial fighters from far-right circles and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. Its current members rejected accusations of nationalism and radicalism. Sviatoslav Palamar, the regiment's deputy commander, said in a recent interview from the steel mill that he preferred the term \"patriotism.\"\n\nWHAT DID THE DEFENDERS ACCOMPLISH?\n\nAs Mariupol became a symbol of the suffering and resistance of Ukrainians after Russia invaded their country, Ukrainian officials repeatedly stressed the role the fighters at Azovstal played in defending the city and stymying Russian progress elsewhere.\n\n\"The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol have already performed a feat, drawing the elite forces of the Russian army onto themselves and significantly slowing down the advance of the Russians in the southeast,\" Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said.\n\nAfter the plant's defenders were instructed to end their fight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the move was proper and humane because \"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle.\"\n\nThe ruined seaside city and the outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian fighters whose persistence frustrated Russia's objective to capture Mariupol quickly are now irrevocably etched into Ukrainian history, regardless of the outcome of the war.\n\nThe defense of Mariupol \"will go down in history as Thermopylae of the 21st century,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's president, said as the fighters started leaving the plant. \"The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy's plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war.\"\n\nThermopylae is widely considered one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing. They were killed to a man, including their king.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for control of the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nThe city endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained from a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left behind rows and rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place.\n\nA week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600. Officials had written the word \"CHILDREN\" in Russian on the pavement outside to try to forestall an aerial attack.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians. The imagery showed rows of graves stretching away from an existing cemetery.\n\nMariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko accused the Russians of \"hiding their military crimes\" in the mass graves and labeled it \"the new Babi Yar\" -- recalling the ravine in Kyiv where the Nazis massacred nearly 34,000 Ukrainian Jews during World War II.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Monday that the evacuation of his forces from the bunkers and tunnels beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\n\"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe Azovstal complex covers 11 square kilometers (4 square miles) and is threaded with about 24 kilometers (15 miles) of tunnels and bunkers. Earlier in May, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires.\n\nOne civilian evacuee from Azovstal, who made it to the Ukrainian controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on May 3, said she went to sleep at the plant every night afraid she wouldn't wake up.\n\n\"You can't imagine how scary it is when you sit in the bomb shelter, in a damp and wet basement, and it is bouncing and shaking,\" said Elina Tsybulchenko, 54.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks spoke emotionally about what may have been their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\n-- Russian lawmakers proposed a bill to lift the age limit of 40 for Russians volunteering for military service. Currently, all Russian men 18 to 27 must undergo a year of service, though many get college deferments and other exemptions.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported Friday in the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking expanse of coal mines and factories.\n\n\"The liberation of the Luhansk People's Republic is nearing completion,\" Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu declared, referring to the breakaway state proclaimed by pro-Moscow separatists in 2014 and recognized by the Kremlin.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces were especially focused on the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway, the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The road is extremely important because it's the only connection to other regions of the country,\" he said via email. \"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region.\"\n\nRussian forces shelled the road constantly from multiple directions, but Ukrainian armored transports were still able to get through, Haidai added.\n\nMoscow's troops have been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas. One of Friday's attacks was on a school in Severodonetsk that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, Haidai said. Three adults were killed, he said on Telegram.\n\nTwelve people were killed in Severodonetsk, Haidai said. It was not immediately clear if that included the three at the school. In addition, more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nRussian forces now control 90 percent of Luhansk, but the attack on Severodonetsk failed -- \"the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated,\" Haidai said. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

Earlier in the week, Ukrainian officials said its combantants in the Azovstal steel plant had completed their mission and were being evacuated, describing them as heroes who had fulfilled a grueling task.\n\nHere's a look at these Ukrainian forces, who were taken prisoner by the Russians as they left the plant, and what they accomplished:\n\nWHO WERE THE DEFENDERS OF MARIUPOL?\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters from the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nThe fighters who held out at Azovstal, for much of the nearly three-month siege of Mariupol with Ukrainian civilians who sought safety in the plant's underground bunkers and tunnels, came from a variety of different military and law enforcement units, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nThere was the Azov Regiment, which is part of Ukraine's National Guard; the 36th Special Marine Brigade of Ukraine's Naval Forces and the 12th brigade of the National Guard. Border guards, police officers, and territorial defense squads formed shortly before the war supplemented their ranks.\n\nThe bulk of these forces were deployed to defend Mariupol, home to a stategically located port, at the start of the Russian invasion. Marines from the 36th brigade held the port and another large plant in Mariupol for more than a month, until they ran out of supplies and ammunition.\n\nThey moved to the Azovstal steel mill to join the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right, and some of them were captured by the Russians.\n\nWHY DOES RUSSIA LABEL THEM 'NATIONALISTS'?\n\nIn announcing Azovstal's seizure, the Russian Defense Ministry's chief spokesman referred to the Azov Regiment's fighters as Nazis and said their commander was taken away in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred of him \"for numerous atrocities.\"\n\nNo evidence has surfaced of the regiment mistreating Ukrainian civilians, hundreds of whom sheltered underground with the fighters. The regiment released several videos taken inside Azovstal that showed their members interacting with the civilians and giving children sweets.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly made negative assertions about the Azov Regiment.\n\nThe National Guard unit grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that rose to bolster Ukraine's underfunded and questionably led military in the fight against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThat conflict broke out after massive protests drove Ukraine's Kremlin-leaning president from office.\n\nThe Azov Battalion drew its initial fighters from far-right circles and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. Its current members rejected accusations of nationalism and radicalism. Sviatoslav Palamar, the regiment's deputy commander, said in a recent interview from the steel mill that he preferred the term \"patriotism.\"\n\nWHAT DID THE DEFENDERS ACCOMPLISH?\n\nAs Mariupol became a symbol of the suffering and resistance of Ukrainians after Russia invaded their country, Ukrainian officials repeatedly stressed the role the fighters at Azovstal played in defending the city and stymying Russian progress elsewhere.\n\n\"The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol have already performed a feat, drawing the elite forces of the Russian army onto themselves and significantly slowing down the advance of the Russians in the southeast,\" Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said.\n\nAfter the plant's defenders were instructed to end their fight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the move was proper and humane because \"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle.\"\n\nThe ruined seaside city and the outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian fighters whose persistence frustrated Russia's objective to capture Mariupol quickly are now irrevocably etched into Ukrainian history, regardless of the outcome of the war.\n\nThe defense of Mariupol \"will go down in history as Thermopylae of the 21st century,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's president, said as the fighters started leaving the plant. \"The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy's plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war.\"\n\nThermopylae is widely considered one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing. They were killed to a man, including their king.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri": "nhregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Haven Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@nhregister.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/25/65/05/22499707/3/rawImage.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 23, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 33, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7048913018", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "20:51:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T20:51:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T19:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "url": "https://wcfcourier.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/russia-claims-to-have-taken-full-control-of-mariupol/article_f6865e97-2d95-5c29-8aa9-abe4d73c5454.html", "title": "Russia claims to have taken full control of Mariupol", "body": "A soldier of Donetsk People's Republic militia sits in a self-propelled artillery vehicle 'Gvozdika' ('Carnation') with writing reading 'towards Kyiv!', near the town of Yasynuvataya, outside Donetsk, in territory under the government of the Donetsk People's Republic, eastern Ukraine, Friday, May 20, 2022.\n\nBy ELENA BECATOROS, OLEKSANDR STASHEVSKYI and CIARAN McQUILLAN - Associated Press\n\nPOKROVSK, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia's defense chief says the country's forces have taken full control of the steel plant in Mariupol that was the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance in the city.\n\nThat would mark the end of a nearly three-month siege that reduced much of Mariupol to ruins and left over 20,000 people feared dead.\n\nDefense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin on Friday that the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol has been \"completely liberated\" from Ukrainian fighters.\n\nThere is no immediate confirmation from Ukraine.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nPOKROVSK, Ukraine (AP) -- The West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine on Friday, as Russia shifted troops freed up by the imminent fall of the pulverized city of Mariupol and fighting raged in the country's industrial heartland in the east.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking eastern expanse of coal mines and factories that Russian President Vladimir Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Russia said more than 1,900 had surrendered in recent days. Also remaining at the plant were the bodies of soldiers who defended it while tying down Russian forces.\n\nDenis Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, which led the defense of the plant, called them \"fallen heroes.\"\n\n\"I hope soon relatives and the whole of Ukraine will be able to bury the fighters with honors,\" he said.\n\nWives of fighters who held out at the steelworks spoke emotionally about what may have been their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\nMeanwhile, fighting intensified deeper in the Donbas.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces were especially focused on the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway, the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The road is extremely important because it's the only connection to other regions of the country,\" he said via email. \"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region.\"\n\nRussian forces shelled the road constantly from multiple directions, but Ukrainian armored transports were still able to get through, Haidai added.\n\nMoscow's troops have been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas. One of Friday's attacks was on a school in Severodonetsk that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, Haidai said. Three adults were killed, he said on Telegram.\n\nTwelve people were killed in Severodonetsk, Haidai said. It was not immediately clear if that included the three at the school. In addition, more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nRussian forces now control 90 percent of Luhansk, but the attack on Severodonetsk failed -- \"the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated,\" Haidai said. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nPro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas for the past eight years and held a considerable swath of it before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. But the effort by Putin's troops to take more territory there has been slow-going.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, Britain's Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian forces elsewhere in Ukraine continued to blast away at targets, some of them civilian.\n\nIn the village of Velyka Kostromka, west of the Donbas, explosions in the middle of the night Thursday shook Iryna Martsyniuk's house to its foundations. Roof timbers splintered and windows shattered, sending shards of glass into a wall near three sleeping children.\n\n\"There were flashes everywhere,\" she said. \"There was smoke everywhere.\" She grabbed the children and ran toward the home's entrance, \"but the corridor wasn't there anymore. Instead, we saw the starry night.\"\n\nThey ran down the road to a neighbor's home, where they hid in the basement.\n\nAround 20 other houses were damaged and two people were lightly wounded, said Olha Shaytanova, head of the village.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

The Ukrainians did not immediately confirm the figures on Azovstal.\n\nUkraine's General Staff of Armed Forces did not comment on Russia's claim in its morning update on Saturday.\n\nThe end of fighting in Mariupol, the biggest city Russia has captured so far and the main port for the Donbas, gives Russian President Vladimir Putin a rare victory in the invasion after a series of setbacks in nearly three months of fighting.\n\nPutin says Russian troops are engaged in a \"special military operation\" to demilitarise Ukraine and rid it of radical anti-Russian nationalists.

Moscow says the prisoners will be treated humanely, but Russian politicians have been quoted as saying some must be tried or even executed.\n\nThousands of people in Ukraine have been killed and urban areas have been shattered in the war.

Gen. Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, said that all Ukrainian fighters had been removed from the underground bunkers of the factory, according to Russia's state-run news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nThe last group of 531 Ukrainian soldiers at the steel factory surrendered Friday, bringing the total evacuated since Monday to 2,439, according to the ministry.\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine. This week, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported that it had registered \"hundreds\" of Ukrainian prisoners of war from Azovstal.\n\nExperts at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington said the discrepancy could be because of reporting delays. But they also raised the possibility that Russian officials intentionally overstated the number of evacuated Ukrainian fighters -- either to maximize the number of Russian prisoners of war they can bring home in an exchange or to avoid the embarrassment of admitting they were locked in a lengthy stalemate with only hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nEarlier Friday, Maj. Denys Prokopenko, the Ukrainian commander of the Azov regiment that led the defense of Mariupol, posted a video statement saying that senior military leadership had issued an order to stop defending the city in order to save the \"lives and health\" of servicemen.\n\n\"I hope soon relatives and the whole of Ukraine will be able to bury their soldiers with honors,\" Prokopenko said in a video posted on Telegram.\n\nDespite some battlefield successes, the growing war of attrition has exacted a grievous toll on Ukraine's civilians and infrastructure, with people killed or maimed, houses pulverized and power cut off in hard-hit communities.\n\nIn a Friday night video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged Western allies to hold Russia financially responsible for the devastation it was wreaking across his country.\n\n\"Every burned house. Every ruined school, ruined hospital,\" he said. \"Each blown-up house of culture and infrastructure facility. Every destroyed enterprise. Every shut-down business.\"\n\nRussian funds and property under the jurisdiction of allied countries, Zelenskyy said, must be \"seized or frozen\" and then distributed to a special fund for Ukrainian victims\n\n\"That would be fair,\" he said. \"And Russia will feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every projectile it has fired at us.\"\n\nTo bolster Ukraine's defense, the U.S. Senate approved $40 billion in new aid on Thursday, sending the package to President Joe Biden for his promised signature. In addition, Germany's finance minister said Friday that the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations would allocate $19.8 billion in aid as part of what the G-7 declared was its commitment \"to our united response to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and to our unwavering support to Ukraine.\"\n\nWestern military and humanitarian assistance have been crucial to Ukraine's ability to defy an enemy whose military might, both in personnel and weaponry, dwarfs its own.\n\n\"This is a demonstration of strong leadership and a necessary contribution to our common defense of freedom,\" Zelenskyy said of the new U.S. pledge.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Friday accused Western countries of mounting a \"serious,\" though ultimately unsuccessful, campaign of cyberattacks against his country.\n\n\"A true aggression has been initiated against Russia, a war in informational space,\" Putin said to members of Russia's Security Council, according to Russian state news agency Tass. \"That cyberaggression against us, as well as the overall sanctions attack on Russia, has failed.\"\n\nThe Kremlin has warned of reprisals against countries rallying behind Ukraine. On Friday, Finland's state-owned natural gas wholesaler, Gasum, said Russia's state energy company, Gazprom, had announced that it would halt supplies to the Finnish company starting Saturday.\n\nThe cutoff comes just a few days after Helsinki submitted its application to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a move that ends decades of official military nonalignment and incenses Moscow. Last month, Gazprom also shut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria over their refusal to pay for the gas in rubles, which would help prop up the beleaguered Russian currency, instead of in the dollars or euros specified under contract.\n\nGasum Chief Executive Mika Wiljanen told customers that the company had \"been carefully preparing for this situation\" and should be able to keep the pipelines running.\n\nWith the conquest of Mariupol, Moscow now controls access to the Sea of Azov and has secured a land corridor that links the Donbas to Crimea, the peninsula it annexed in 2014.\n\nThat has had disastrous effects on Ukraine's economy, particularly its ability to export the grain that millions of people around the world depend on for food. Officials said the loss in trade and the costs of war have contributed to a budget deficit of $5 billion. And reduced exports and rising prices for wheat have worsened food insecurity in Egypt, Pakistan and elsewhere.\n\nAt a United Nations Security Council meeting Thursday to address the crisis, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said the food supply for millions of people worldwide was being \"held hostage by the Russian military\" -- an accusation that Russian officials dismissed as a lie. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was trying to negotiate a plan to move Ukrainian food exports out through the Black Sea.\n\nValeriy Zaluzhny, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, told journalists that his troops have so far managed to keep the key Black Sea port of Mykolaiv, west of Crimea, under Ukrainian control.\n\nUkrainian forces are also pushing southeast toward Kherson, the first city to fall after the war began Feb. 24, amid growing signs that Russia is planning to annex parts of the region, including the city of Melitopol, where the occupiers are reportedly introducing the use of the ruble in place of the Ukrainian hryvnia.\n\nFears remain high for the Ukrainian soldiers captured in Mariupol. Transferred to a penal camp in Russian-controlled territory, many are severely injured and face deep hostility from Russian soldiers and politicians, who have branded the Azov regiment as \"Nazis\" deserving trial and punishment.\n\nEarlier this week, the government in Kyiv said it was giving up the fight for the devastated city, but a band of diehard soldiers remained holed up in the plant.\n\nCompleting its takeover of Mariupol allows Russia to continue moving troops to the Donbas, now the focus of its offensive after its failure to capture Kyiv or the northeastern city of Kharkiv. But having been tied up so long in Mariupol and suffered losses, the forces there \"must be re-equipped and refurbished before they can be redeployed effectively,\" which can be a lengthy process, Britain's Ministry of Defense said in its daily assessment of the war.\n\nThe Russian military has fallen well short of Putin's goals for his so-called special military operation in Ukraine. To try to notch more successes quickly, \"Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition,\" the British assessment said.\n\nThe British government reported earlier that a number of senior commanders had already been relieved of their posts, including Lt. Gen. Serhiy Kisel, whose fighters were unable to subdue Kharkiv. Vice Adm. Igor Osipov, the head of Russia's Black Sea fleet, has also likely been suspended following the sinking of the flagship cruiser Moskva last month, a stunning victory for Ukraine that was aided by U.S.-provided intelligence.\n\n\"A culture of cover-ups and scapegoating is probably prevalent within the Russian military and security system,\" the British Ministry of Defense said. \"Many officials involved in the invasion of Ukraine will likely be increasingly distracted by efforts to avoid personal culpability for Russia's operational setbacks.\"\n\n------\n\n(McDonnell reported from Kyiv, Chu from London and Jenny Jarvie from Atlanta.)\n\n-------\n\n\u00a92022 Los Angeles Times.

All times Eastern:\n\nMay 20, 3:41 pm\n\nRussian Ministry of Defense claims it has taken complete control over Azovstal steel plant, Mariupol\n\nRussia's Ministry of Defense claimed Friday it has taken complete control of the Azovstal plant and Mariupol from the Ukrainian forces, expelling them from the port city.\n\nThe underground facilities of the plant, in which the Azov National Regiment militia were hiding, came under the complete control of Russian forces, the ministry claimed.\n\nThe commander of the Azov Regiment was reportedly taken out of the territory of the plant in an armored car, the ministry said.\n\nRussia claims 2,439 Ukrainian servicemen have laid down their arms and surrendered since May 16.\n\nMay 20, 1:10 pm\n\nRussia to cut off Finland's natural gas Saturday morning\n\nGasum, Finland's natural gas company, announced Friday that it was informed its imports from Russia's Gazprom Export will be cut off on Saturday at 7 a.m. local time.\n\nThe move by Russia comes days after Finland submitted its application to join NATO.\n\n\"It is highly regrettable that natural gas supplies under our supply contract will now be halted. However, we have been carefully preparing for this situation and provided that there will be no disruptions in the gas transmission network, we will be able to supply all our customers with gas in the coming months,\" Gasum CEO Mika Wiljanen said in a statement.\n\nGasum will supply natural gas to its customers from other sources though the Balticconnector pipeline, which connects Finland with Estonia, the company said in a statement.\n\nGasum said its gas-filling stations in the network area will continue in normal operation.\n\nMay 20, 8:57 am\n\nUS-supplied howitzers to Ukraine lack accuracy-aiding computers\n\nDozens of artillery systems supplied by the United States to Ukraine were not fitted with advanced computer systems, which improve the efficiency and accuracy of the weapons, ABC News has learned.\n\nThe M777 155mm howitzers are now being used by the Ukrainian military in its war with Russia.\n\nThe Pentagon did not deny that the artillery pieces were supplied without the computers but said it had received \"positive feedback\" from the Ukrainians about the \"precise and highly effective\" weapons.\n\nThat positive sentiment was echoed by a Ukrainian politician, who spoke to ABC News on condition of anonymity. However, the politician also expressed frustration that the artillery pieces had not been the fitted with the digital computer systems.\n\nArtillery is currently playing a crucial role in the fighting across eastern Ukraine, as Russia continues its offensive in that part of the country. U.S. officials recently confirmed that all but one of the 90 howitzers promised to Ukraine had now been delivered, along with tactical vehicles used to tow them.\n\nIf fitted to a howitzer, the digital computer system enables the crew operating the weapon to quickly and accurately pinpoint a target. Howitzers without a computer system can still be fired accurately, using traditional methods to calculate the angle needed to hit a target.\n\nModern computer systems, however, rule out the possibility of human error. Why the artillery pieces supplied to Ukraine did not have the digital targeting technology installed is unclear. The Pentagon said it would not discuss individual components \"for operational security reasons.\"\n\n-ABC News' Tom Burridge and Luis Martinez\n\nMay 20, 6:58 am\n\n1,700 Ukrainian soldiers likely surrendered from Mariupol plant, UK says\n\nAs many as 1,700 Ukrainian soldiers have likely surrendered from the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works plant in war-ravaged Mariupol this week, according to the U.K. Ministry of Defense.\n\n\"An unknown number of Ukrainian forces remain inside the factory,\" the ministry said Friday in an intelligence update. \"Once Russia has secured Mariupol, it is likely they will move their forces to reinforce operations in the Donbas.\"\n\nFor weeks, Ukrainian fighters and civilians were holed up inside the sprawling industrial site as the remaining pocket of resistance to Russia's relentless bombardment of Mariupol, a southeastern Ukrainian port city strategically located on the Sea of Azov between eastern Ukraine's disputed Donbas region and the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula. Russia claimed Thursday that 1,730 Ukrainian soldiers had surrendered in Mariupol over the previous three days, while Ukraine confirmed Tuesday that more than 250 had yielded in the initial hours after it ordered them to do so.\n\nMariupol is the largest city that Russian forces have seized since launching an invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24. Its complete capture gives Russia total control of the coast of the Sea of Azov as well as a continuous stretch of territory along eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\n\"Staunch Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol since the start of the war means Russian forces in the area must be re-equipped and refurbished before they can be redeployed effectively,\" the U.K. defense ministry said. \"This can be a lengthy process when done thoroughly.\"\n\n\"Russian commanders, however, are under pressure to demonstrably achieve operational objectives,\" the ministry added. \"This means that Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition.\"\n\nMay 20, 6:42 am\n\nBelarus says nearly 28,000 Ukrainians have arrived since Russian invasion\n\nNearly 28,000 Ukrainian citizens have arrived in Belarus since Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, according to the Belarusian State Border Committee.\n\n\"Between 6 a.m. on February 24 and 6 a.m. on May 20, a total of 27,868 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Belarus, including 15,793 who crossed the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, 10,563 by transit through Poland, 1,305 through Lithuania, and 207 through Latvia,\" the committee said in a statement Friday.\n\nIn the past 24 hours alone, 154 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Belarus, including 120 via Poland, according to the committee.\n\nBelarus shares a land border with both Ukraine and Russia, and is Moscow's main ally.\n\nMay 19, 8:07 pm\n\nBiden to sign Ukraine aid bill while abroad\n\nPresident Joe Biden will sign the $40 billion Ukraine aid bill while he's in Asia, a White House official said.\n\n\"The president does intend to sign the bill while he's on the road so that he can sign it expeditiously,\" national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One while en route to the region Thursday evening. \"The modalities of that are being worked right now so that he can get it and sign it.\"\n\nThe bill, which passed the Senate earlier Thursday with bipartisan support, will need to be flown to the region so that Biden can sign it. The practice of flying bills to presidents for signature dates back to the Truman administration, but this is a first for Biden.\n\nBiden departed for South Korea Thursday and will visit Japan later in the week during his first trip to Asia as president.", "source": {"uri": "wfin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFIN"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://wfin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/getty_052022_ukraineupdates-k5O66S.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 17, "stanza_neu": 43, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 62, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7050307309", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-22", "time": "09:24:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-22T09:24:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-22T09:23:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "url": "https://www.voanews.com/a/poland-s-president-to-speak-to-ukraine-s-parliament-/6584143.html", "title": "Poland's President to Speak to Ukraine's Parliament ", "body": "Poland's president is scheduled to address Ukraine's parliament Sunday.\n\nAndrzej Duda will be the first foreign head of state to speak to Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

It will just be put on pause for some time,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, who is also an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said, explaining Ukraine's position in light of recent calls for a cease-fire from U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. \"They'll start a new offensive, even more bloody and large-scale,\" Podolyak added.\n\nPro-Russian separatists have fought Ukraine for control of the Luhansk and Donetsk provinces - which together make up the Donbas - since 2014, when Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula.\n\nUkrainian forces in the two provinces said via Facebook that at least seven people had been killed in Donetsk in the previous 24 hours when Russians, using aircraft, artillery, tanks, rockets, mortars and missiles, pummeled civilian structures and residential areas, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Ukrainians said they had turned back nine attacks, destroying five tanks and 10 armored vehicles, according to the Facebook post.\n\n\"The situation in Donbas is extremely difficult,\" Zelenskyy said Saturday in his nightly address. He said Ukrainian forces were holding off the Russian army as it was trying to attack the cities of Sloviansk and Sievierodonetsk.\n\nIn another development Saturday, Russia published a list of nearly 1,000 Americans who are permanently banned from entry into Russia because of their support for Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are among those on the list that also includes members of the president's Cabinet.\n\nOn Friday night Zelenskyy said that victory against Russia will ultimately come through a diplomatic settlement.\n\n\"The victory will be difficult, it will be bloody and in battle, but its end will be in diplomacy. I am very convinced of this,\" Zelenskyy said in a Ukrainian television interview late Friday. \"There are things that we can't bring to an end without sitting at the negotiation table.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian leader also said his country is attempting to recover fighters who surrendered to Russian forces after weeks of fighting at the Azovstal steel plant in the southern port city of Mariupol.\n\n\"Everything will depend on (the responsibilities) the U.N., the Red Cross and the Russian Federation took on themselves, that they (the fighters) all will be in safety, waiting for one or the other exchange format,\" he said. He said Ukraine's intelligence service is making preparations \"for a dialogue and an exchange.\"\n\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly three months ago, on Feb. 24.\n\nConcern for the treatment of those fighters increased Saturday when Denis Pushilin, the pro-Kremlin head of an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, said they would face tribunals.\n\nPushilin said there were 2,439 people in custody, including some foreign nationals among the fighters.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Saturday that Ukraine would fight for the return of every soldier.\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine that Mariupol was fully under Russian control.\n\nThe port city is the scene of the war's bloodiest siege, with Russian forces bombarding it for nearly three months. Much of Mariupol has been reduced to rubble, and more than 20,000 civilians are feared dead.\n\nBut its capture adds to Moscow's goal of a land route from Russia to the Crimea and perhaps beyond.\n\nRussia destroyed a Ukrainian special operations base near Odesa, Ukraine's main Black Sea port on Saturday, as well as a significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region, The Associated Press reported, quoting Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nThe end of the fighting in Mariupol not only gives Russian President Vladimir Putin a victory, but it allows him to shift fighters east to the Donbas.\n\nAmong the developments there:\n\nThe only functioning hospital in Sievierodonetsk, the main city under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk region, has three doctors left and enough supplies for 10 days, Gov. Serhii Haidai said.\n\nHaidai also said Russian troops destroyed a bridge on the Siverskiy Donets River between Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. There was fighting on the outskirts of Sievierodonetsk from morning through the night, Haidai said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nA monastery in the village of Bohorodichne in the Donetsk region was evacuated after it was hit by a Russian airstrike, the regional police said Saturday, the AP reported.\n\nAbout 100 monks, nuns and children had been sheltering in the basement of the church and no one was hurt, the police said in a Facebook post, which included a video of the damage to the monastery as well as nuns, monks and children boarding vans on Friday for the evacuation.\n\nZelenskyy on Saturday emphasized that the Donbas remains part of Ukraine and his forces were fighting to liberate it.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://gdb.voanews.com/031a0000-0aff-0242-b838-08da3ba144e2_w1200_r1.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 5, "stanza_neu": 33, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 39, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049570747", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "13:12:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T13:12:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T12:29:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "url": "https://journalstar.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/russias-claim-of-mariupols-capture-fuels-concern-for-pows/article_517c79f2-484b-529b-8896-00dce7174a74.html", "title": "Russia's claim of Mariupol's capture fuels concern for POWs", "body": "Residents live in the basement of a building used as bomb shelter in the village of Staryi Saltiv, east Kharkiv, Ukraine, Friday, May 20, 2022.

There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency Tass quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance, and with it completing Moscow's long-sought goal of controlling the city, home to a strategic seaport.\n\nUkraine's military this week told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe impact of Russia's declared victory on the broader war in Ukraine remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict, which began with the Russian invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base in Black Sea region of Odesa as well as significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn its morning operational report, the Ukrainian military general staff reported heavy fighting in much of eastern Ukraine, including the areas of Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nSince failing to reach and capture Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Russia focused its offensive in the country's eastern industrial heartland. The Russia-backed separatists have controlled parts of the Donbas region since 2014, and Moscow wants to expand the territory under its control.\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockkaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nAs the end drew near at the steel plant, wives of fighters who had held out told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, the wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she shared the words her husband wrote her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nThe wife of another fighter, Natalia Zaritskaya, said her husband reported earlier this week that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived and most were seriously wounded.\n\n\"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly,\" Zaritskaya said.\n\nThe seasize steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been a battleground for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters held out with the help of air drops of supplies, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant and save themselves.\n\nRussia said the Azov Regiment's commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred for him.\n\nNo evidence of Ukrainian antipathy toward the nationalist regiment has emerged. The Kremlin has seized on the regiment's far-right origins in its drive to to cast the invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial.\n\nCapturing Mariupol furthers Russia's quest to essentially create a land bridge from Russia via much of the Donbas area bordering Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe city's seizure also helps Russian leader Putin offset some stinging setbacks, including the failure to take over Kyiv, the sinking of the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea and continued resistance that has stalled the offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nWith Mariupol under Russian control, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in the city, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theater where civilians had taken cover.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAt one point in the siege, Pope Francis lamented that Mariupol had become a \"city of martyrs.\"\n\nAn estimated 100,000 of the 450,000 people who resided there before the war remain. Many, trapped by Russia's siege, were left without food, water and electricity.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the steel plant during humanitarian cease-fires. They spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nThe chief executive of Metinvest, a multinational company which owns the Azovstal plant and another steel mill, Ilyich, in Mariupol, spoke of the city's devastation in an interview published Saturday in Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to clean it (the city) up to hide their crimes,'' the newspaper quoted Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov as saying. \"The inhabitants are trying to make the city function, to make water supplies work again.\"\n\n\"But the sewer system is damaged, there has been flooding, and infections are feared\" from drinking the water, he said.\n\nThe Ilyich steelworks still has some intact infrastructure, but if the Russians try to get it running, Ukrainians will refuse to return to their jobs there, Ryzhenkov said.\n\n\"We will never work under Russian occupation,'' Ryzhenkov said.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

The Azovstal steel plant became a symbol of Ukrainian tenacity, and its seizure delivers Russian President Vladimir Putin a badly wanted victory in the war he began in February.\n\nFamily members of the steel mill fighters, who authorities say came from a variety of military and law enforcement units, have pleaded for them to be given rights as prisoners of war and eventually returned to Ukraine. They are considered heroes by their fellow citizens.\n\nPeople are also reading...

At least some Ukrainians were taken to a former penal colony, while Russian authorities said others were hospitalized.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the pro-Kremlin head of an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, said the Ukrainians were sure to face a tribunal for their wartime actions.\n\n\"I believe that justice must be restored. There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency Tass quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nRussian officials and state media have sought to characterize the fighters as neo-Nazis and criminals. Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast its invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance.\n\nUkraine's military had told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe end of the battle for Mariupol would help Putin offset some stinging setbacks, including the failure of Russian troops to take over Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, the sinking of the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea and the continued resistance that has stalled an offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nIt also furthers Russia's quest to essentially create a land bridge from Russia stretching through the Donbas region to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe impact on the broader war remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base in the Black Sea region of Odesa as well as a significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn its morning operational report, the Ukrainian military general staff reported heavy fighting in much of eastern Ukraine, including the areas of Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said Saturday that Russia is expected to relaunch an offensive on the strategically important city of Sloviansk, in the eastern Donetsk region. The city is critical to Russia's objective of capturing all of eastern Ukraine and saw fierce fighting last month after Moscow's troops backed off from Kyiv.\n\nUkraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he would not launch a counterattack into Russian territory but emphasized that the Donbas region remains sovereign to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking at a joint media conference with Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa, Zelenskyy said his forces were fighting to \"liberate our territory\" and the price of \"tens or hundreds of thousands of lives\" was too high to surrender it. He pressed Western countries for multiple launch rocket systems, which he said \"just stand still\" in other countries yet are \"key\" to Ukraine's success.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden signed off Saturday on a fresh, $40 billion infusion of aid for Ukraine, with half for military assistance. Portugal pledged up to 250 million euros, as well as continued shipments of military equipment.\n\nZelenskyy reiterated his intention to apply for European Union membership and accused Russia of blockading agricultural exports from Ukraine, which is known as the \"breadbasket of Europe.\"\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nThe seaside steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), was a battleground for weeks. Drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, the dwindling group of outgunned Ukrainian fighters held out with the help of airdrops.\n\nZelenskyy revealed in an interview published Friday that Ukrainian helicopter pilots braved Russian anti-aircraft fire to ferry in medicine, food and water to the steel mill as well as to retrieve bodies and rescue wounded fighters.\n\nA \"very large\" number of the pilots died on the missions, he said. \"They are absolutely heroic people, who knew that it would be difficult, knew that to fly would be almost impossible,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nRussia claimed that the Azov Regiment's commander was taken from the plant in an armored vehicle because of residents' alleged hatred for him, but no evidence of Ukrainian antipathy toward the nationalist regiment has emerged.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry on Saturday released video of Russian troops taking into custody Serhiy Volynskyy, the commander of the Ukrainian Navy's 36th Special Marine Brigade, which was one of the main forces defending the steel plant. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify the date, location and conditions of the video.\n\nWith Russia controlling the city, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in Mariupol, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theater where hundreds of civilians had taken cover. Satellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 of the 450,000 people who resided in Mariupol before the war remain. Many, trapped by Russia's siege, were left without food, water and electricity.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol warned Saturday the city is facing a health and sanitation \"catastrophe\" from mass burials in shallow pits across the ruined city as well as the breakdown of sewage systems. Vadim Boychenko said summer rains threaten to contaminate water sources as he pressed Russian forces to allow residents to safely leave the city.\n\n\"In addition to the humanitarian catastrophe created by the (Russian) occupiers and collaborators, the city is on the verge of an outbreak of infectious diseases,\" he said on the messaging app Telegram.\n\nThe chief executive of Metinvest, a multinational company that owns the Azovstal plant and another steel mill, Ilyich, in Mariupol, spoke of the city's devastation in an interview published Saturday in Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to clean it (the city) up to hide their crimes,'' Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov said. \"The inhabitants are trying to make the city function, to make water supplies work again.\"\n\n\"But the sewer system is damaged, there has been flooding, and infections are feared\" from drinking the water, he said.\n\nThe Ilyich steelworks still has some intact infrastructure, but if the Russians try to get it running, Ukrainians will refuse to return to their jobs there, Ryzhenkov said.\n\n\"We will never work under Russian occupation,'' he said.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

Earlier in the week, Ukrainian officials said its combantants in the Azovstal steel plant had completed their mission and were being evacuated, describing them as heroes who had fulfilled a grueling task.\n\nHere's a look at these Ukrainian forces, who were taken prisoner by the Russians as they left the plant, and what they accomplished:\n\nWHO WERE THE DEFENDERS OF MARIUPOL?\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters from the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nThe fighters who held out at Azovstal, for much of the nearly three-month siege of Mariupol with Ukrainian civilians who sought safety in the plant's underground bunkers and tunnels, came from a variety of different military and law enforcement units, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nThere was the Azov Regiment, which is part of Ukraine's National Guard; the 36th Special Marine Brigade of Ukraine's Naval Forces and the 12th brigade of the National Guard. Border guards, police officers, and territorial defense squads formed shortly before the war supplemented their ranks.\n\nThe bulk of these forces were deployed to defend Mariupol, home to a stategically located port, at the start of the Russian invasion. Marines from the 36th brigade held the port and another large plant in Mariupol for more than a month, until they ran out of supplies and ammunition.\n\nThey moved to the Azovstal steel mill to join the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right, and some of them were captured by the Russians.\n\nWHY DOES RUSSIA LABEL THEM 'NATIONALISTS'?\n\nIn announcing Azovstal's seizure, the Russian Defense Ministry's chief spokesman referred to the Azov Regiment's fighters as Nazis and said their commander was taken away in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred of him \"for numerous atrocities.\"\n\nNo evidence has surfaced of the regiment mistreating Ukrainian civilians, hundreds of whom sheltered underground with the fighters. The regiment released several videos taken inside Azovstal that showed their members interacting with the civilians and giving children sweets.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly made negative assertions about the Azov Regiment.\n\nThe National Guard unit grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that rose to bolster Ukraine's underfunded and questionably led military in the fight against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThat conflict broke out after massive protests drove Ukraine's Kremlin-leaning president from office.\n\nThe Azov Battalion drew its initial fighters from far-right circles and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. Its current members rejected accusations of nationalism and radicalism. Sviatoslav Palamar, the regiment's deputy commander, said in a recent interview from the steel mill that he preferred the term \"patriotism.\"\n\nWHAT DID THE DEFENDERS ACCOMPLISH?\n\nAs Mariupol became a symbol of the suffering and resistance of Ukrainians after Russia invaded their country, Ukrainian officials repeatedly stressed the role the fighters at Azovstal played in defending the city and stymying Russian progress elsewhere.\n\n\"The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol have already performed a feat, drawing the elite forces of the Russian army onto themselves and significantly slowing down the advance of the Russians in the southeast,\" Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said.\n\nAfter the plant's defenders were instructed to end their fight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the move was proper and humane because \"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle.\"\n\nThe ruined seaside city and the outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian fighters whose persistence frustrated Russia's objective to capture Mariupol quickly are now irrevocably etched into Ukrainian history, regardless of the outcome of the war.\n\nThe defense of Mariupol \"will go down in history as Thermopylae of the 21st century,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's president, said as the fighters started leaving the plant. \"The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy's plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war.\"\n\nThermopylae is widely considered one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing. They were killed to a man, including their king.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri": "beaumontenterprise.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beaumont Enterprise"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@beaumontenterprise.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/25/65/05/22499707/3/rawImage.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 22, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 32, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7048012959", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "07:21:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T07:21:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T06:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ukraine-says-russian-attacks-on-donbas-intensifying/articleshow/91681754.cms", "title": "Ukraine says Russian attacks on Donbas intensifying - Times of India", "body": "KYIV/SLATYNE, Ukraine: Russian forces intensified their offensive in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region using artillery, rocket-launchers and aircraft to damage defences around Donetsk, Ukraine's general staff said on Friday.\n\n\"The Russian enemy carried out massive artillery shelling of civilian infrastructure, including multiple rocket-launchers,\" it said in a statement.\n\nRussian shelling in Luhansk, also in the Donbas, has killed 13 civilians over the past 24 hours, regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said.\n\nTwelve were killed in the town of Sievierodonesk, where a Russian assault had been unsuccessful, he said.\n\nUkraine's Prosecutor General office said 232 children had been killed and 427 wounded since the beginning of Russian invasion.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the reports and Russia denies targeting civilians.\n\nThe industrial Donbas region, the focus of recent Russian offensives, has been destroyed, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, as some of the world's richest countries pledged to bolster Kyiv with billions of dollars.\n\nSince turning away from Ukraine's capital, Russia is using massed artillery and armour to try to capture more territory in the Donbas, comprised of the Donetsk and Luhansk areas, which Moscow claims on behalf of separatists.\n\n\"The occupiers are trying to exert even more pressure.

Others were said to be taken to hospital.\n\nThe defence of the steel mill had been led by Ukraine's Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast its invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armoured vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometres, had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defence and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on Febrary 24 - a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point was of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nIn other developments, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine, and fighting raged in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a pre-war population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theatre where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9000 civilians.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian ceasefires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they would not make it out alive.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, described the defence of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" - a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480BC before finally succumbing.", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Financial Review"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5293%2C$multiply_2%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_103%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_no_label_no_age_social_wm/88ff6aa6fd1a47508c331769310c5d3237d620b0", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 14, "stanza_neu": 20, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 34, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7048861707", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "19:46:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T19:46:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T19:13:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6196078658103943, "url": "https://journalnow.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/russia-claims-to-have-taken-full-control-of-mariupol/article_04a91f66-5ffc-5d9c-9719-2c18b7cb8fd4.html", "title": "Russia claims to have taken full control of Mariupol", "body": "A soldier of Donetsk People's Republic militia sits in a self-propelled artillery vehicle 'Gvozdika' ('Carnation') with writing reading 'towards Kyiv!', near the town of Yasynuvataya, outside Donetsk, in territory under the government of the Donetsk People's Republic, eastern Ukraine, Friday, May 20, 2022.\n\nBy ELENA BECATOROS, OLEKSANDR STASHEVSKYI and CIARAN McQUILLAN - Associated Press\n\nPOKROVSK, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia's defense chief says the country's forces have taken full control of the steel plant in Mariupol that was the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance in the city.\n\nThat would mark the end of a nearly three-month siege that reduced much of Mariupol to ruins and left over 20,000 people feared dead.\n\nDefense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin on Friday that the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol has been \"completely liberated\" from Ukrainian fighters.\n\nThere is no immediate confirmation from Ukraine.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE.

Russia said more than 1,900 had surrendered in recent days. Also remaining at the plant were the bodies of soldiers who defended it while tying down Russian forces.\n\nDenis Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, which led the defense of the plant, called them \"fallen heroes.\"\n\n\"I hope soon relatives and the whole of Ukraine will be able to bury the fighters with honors,\" he said.\n\nWives of fighters who held out at the steelworks spoke emotionally about what may have been their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello.

In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\nMeanwhile, fighting intensified deeper in the Donbas.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces were especially focused on the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway, the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The road is extremely important because it's the only connection to other regions of the country,\" he said via email. \"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region.\"\n\nRussian forces shelled the road constantly from multiple directions, but Ukrainian armored transports were still able to get through, Haidai added.\n\nMoscow's troops have been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas. One of Friday's attacks was on a school in Severodonetsk that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, Haidai said. Three adults were killed, he said on Telegram.\n\nTwelve people were killed in Severodonetsk, Haidai said. It was not immediately clear if that included the three at the school. In addition, more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nRussian forces now control 90 percent of Luhansk, but the attack on Severodonetsk failed -- \"the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated,\" Haidai said. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nPro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas for the past eight years and held a considerable swath of it before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. But the effort by Putin's troops to take more territory there has been slow-going.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, Britain's Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian forces elsewhere in Ukraine continued to blast away at targets, some of them civilian.\n\nIn the village of Velyka Kostromka, west of the Donbas, explosions in the middle of the night Thursday shook Iryna Martsyniuk's house to its foundations. Roof timbers splintered and windows shattered, sending shards of glass into a wall near three sleeping children.\n\n\"There were flashes everywhere,\" she said. \"There was smoke everywhere.\" She grabbed the children and ran toward the home's entrance, \"but the corridor wasn't there anymore. Instead, we saw the starry night.\"\n\nThey ran down the road to a neighbor's home, where they hid in the basement.\n\nAround 20 other houses were damaged and two people were lightly wounded, said Olha Shaytanova, head of the village.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

Earlier in the week, Ukrainian officials said its combantants in the Azovstal steel plant had completed their mission and were being evacuated, describing them as heroes who had fulfilled a grueling task.\n\nHere's a look at these Ukrainian forces, who were taken prisoner by the Russians as they left the plant, and what they accomplished:\n\nWHO WERE THE DEFENDERS OF MARIUPOL?\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters from the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nThe fighters who held out at Azovstal, for much of the nearly three-month siege of Mariupol with Ukrainian civilians who sought safety in the plant's underground bunkers and tunnels, came from a variety of different military and law enforcement units, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nThere was the Azov Regiment, which is part of Ukraine's National Guard; the 36th Special Marine Brigade of Ukraine's Naval Forces and the 12th brigade of the National Guard. Border guards, police officers, and territorial defense squads formed shortly before the war supplemented their ranks.\n\nThe bulk of these forces were deployed to defend Mariupol, home to a stategically located port, at the start of the Russian invasion. Marines from the 36th brigade held the port and another large plant in Mariupol for more than a month, until they ran out of supplies and ammunition.\n\nThey moved to the Azovstal steel mill to join the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right, and some of them were captured by the Russians.\n\nWHY DOES RUSSIA LABEL THEM 'NATIONALISTS'?\n\nIn announcing Azovstal's seizure, the Russian Defense Ministry's chief spokesman referred to the Azov Regiment's fighters as Nazis and said their commander was taken away in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred of him \"for numerous atrocities.\"\n\nNo evidence has surfaced of the regiment mistreating Ukrainian civilians, hundreds of whom sheltered underground with the fighters. The regiment released several videos taken inside Azovstal that showed their members interacting with the civilians and giving children sweets.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly made negative assertions about the Azov Regiment.\n\nThe National Guard unit grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that rose to bolster Ukraine's underfunded and questionably led military in the fight against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThat conflict broke out after massive protests drove Ukraine's Kremlin-leaning president from office.\n\nThe Azov Battalion drew its initial fighters from far-right circles and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. Its current members rejected accusations of nationalism and radicalism. Sviatoslav Palamar, the regiment's deputy commander, said in a recent interview from the steel mill that he preferred the term \"patriotism.\"\n\nWHAT DID THE DEFENDERS ACCOMPLISH?\n\nAs Mariupol became a symbol of the suffering and resistance of Ukrainians after Russia invaded their country, Ukrainian officials repeatedly stressed the role the fighters at Azovstal played in defending the city and stymying Russian progress elsewhere.\n\n\"The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol have already performed a feat, drawing the elite forces of the Russian army onto themselves and significantly slowing down the advance of the Russians in the southeast,\" Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said.\n\nAfter the plant's defenders were instructed to end their fight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the move was proper and humane because \"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle.\"\n\nThe ruined seaside city and the outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian fighters whose persistence frustrated Russia's objective to capture Mariupol quickly are now irrevocably etched into Ukrainian history, regardless of the outcome of the war.\n\nThe defense of Mariupol \"will go down in history as Thermopylae of the 21st century,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's president, said as the fighters started leaving the plant. \"The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy's plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war.\"\n\nThermopylae is widely considered one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.

Luhansk is part of the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking eastern expanse of coal mines and factories that Russian President Vladimir Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Russia said more than 1,900 had surrendered in recent days. Also remaining at the plant were the bodies of soldiers who defended it while tying down Russian forces.\n\nDenis Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, which led the defense of the plant, called them \"fallen heroes.\"\n\n\"I hope soon relatives and the whole of Ukraine will be able to bury the fighters with honors,\" he said.\n\nWives of fighters who held out at the steelworks spoke emotionally about what may have been their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\nMeanwhile, fighting intensified deeper in the Donbas.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces were especially focused on the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway, the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The road is extremely important because it's the only connection to other regions of the country,\" he said via email. \"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region.\"\n\nRussian forces shelled the road constantly from multiple directions, but Ukrainian armored transports were still able to get through, Haidai added.\n\nMoscow's troops have been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas. One of Friday's attacks was on a school in Severodonetsk that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, Haidai said. Three adults were killed, he said on Telegram.\n\nTwelve people were killed in Severodonetsk, Haidai said. It was not immediately clear if that included the three at the school. In addition, more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nRussian forces now control 90 percent of Luhansk, but the attack on Severodonetsk failed -- \"the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated,\" Haidai said. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nPro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas for the past eight years and held a considerable swath of it before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. But the effort by Putin's troops to take more territory there has been slow-going.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, Britain's Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian forces elsewhere in Ukraine continued to blast away at targets, some of them civilian.\n\nIn the village of Velyka Kostromka, west of the Donbas, explosions in the middle of the night Thursday shook Iryna Martsyniuk's house to its foundations. Roof timbers splintered and windows shattered, sending shards of glass into a wall near three sleeping children.\n\n\"There were flashes everywhere,\" she said. \"There was smoke everywhere.\" She grabbed the children and ran toward the home's entrance, \"but the corridor wasn't there anymore. Instead, we saw the starry night.\"\n\nThey ran down the road to a neighbor's home, where they hid in the basement.\n\nAround 20 other houses were damaged and two people were lightly wounded, said Olha Shaytanova, head of the village.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

Ukrainian forces made their last stand in the massive Azovstal Iron and Steel Works, a four-square-mile fortress of industrial buildings and a deep network of tunnels connecting 36 bomb shelters designed to survive nuclear blasts. Now, most of those forces have been evacuated to Russian-controlled territory or they are dead.\n\n\"Russia can take what's left of the city. But, wow, has it lost the narrative,\" says Olga Oliker at the International Crisis Group. \"On the Ukrainian side, you have these tales of heroism and self-sacrifice,\" while \"on the Russian side, all you've got is 'we kept pummeling and pummeling and pummeling and pummeling.'\"\n\n\"Putin will be able to capitalize on this success until Russian forces face their next major setback, after which Azovstal will be a distant memory for most Russians,\" Jamestown Foundation president Glen Howard tells Radio Free Europe. \"But for Ukrainians, the memory of the siege of Mariupol will serve as a rallying cry for generations to come.\"\n\nHere's how the story played out.\n\nRussian and allied forces invade Ukraine, and one of their first targets is Mariupol, a key Ukrainian port city on the Sea of Azov.\n\nRussian missiles strike the maternity ward of Mariupol's hospital, in one of Moscow's first large-scale attacks on hospitals and other civilian infrastructure.\n\nRussia bombs Mariupol's landmark theater, killing about 600 people sheltering there, even though \"Children\" was written in Russian in large letters outside the building.\n\nRussian and allied forces gain control of most of Mariupol, splitting the Ukrainian fighters into two areas: the port in the city's southwest and the Azovstal steel plant in the east.\n\nFighters with Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade break through their encirclement at Mariupol's Ilyich metal plant and join up with the Azov Battalion and other national guard units at Azovstal. Hundreds of civilians are sheltering in the underground bunkers.\n\nRussia orders the Ukrainian fighters in the Azovstal plant to surrender within 24 hours. They decline.\n\nPutin declares Mariupol \"liberated\" from Ukraine, orders Russian forces to seal off Azovstal but not attack.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres meets with Putin in Moscow, secures agreement \"in principle\" to evacuate civilians from the Azovstal plant.\n\nRussia steps up bombing and shelling for 48 hours, collapsing an underground field hospital and crushing injured fighters and civilians, according to Ukrainian fighters.\n\nEvacuation of civilians from Azovstal begins, under deal reached between Ukraine, Russia, the U.N., and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).\n\nAll civilian women and children are out of Azovstal, transported either to Russian-held areas or the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nA group of wives and girlfriends of Azovstal fighters meet with Pope Francis and ask him to intercede to \"save their lives.\"\n\nThe first 264 Ukrainian fighters are evacuated from Azovstal and transported to hospitals or detention camps in Russian-controlled Ukraine. Ukraine declares its Mariupol \"combat mission\" complete, tells remaining fighters to surrender. \"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said.\n\nDenis Pusilin, the leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, says \"the Azovstal plant, or rather, what remains of it, will be demolished,\" and Mariupol will be turned into a resort city. \"Azovstal was a major element of Mariupol's economy before the war,\" the Institute for the Study of War notes. Razing it to build a resort city \"epitomizes the kind of Pyrrhic victories Russian forces have won in Ukraine, to the extent that they have won victories at all.\"\n\nRussia says 1,730 fighters have been evacuated from Azovstal and taken to Russian-held areas. The ICRC says it has registered hundreds of the fighters as prisoners of war, granting them basic rights under the Geneva Conventions. An unknown number of Ukrainian fighters remain inside the plant, and some say they won't surrender.\n\n\"There's some real gains for Russia here, but if you look at this from the Ukrainian perspective, Mariupol has really become a symbol -- and the steel plant in particular, and the defenders inside of it -- have become this symbol of Ukrainian resistance that I think is going to be a defining feature of this war,\" Michael Schwirtz reports on The New York Times' Daily podcast. \"Up and down the line, you have these examples of Ukrainian soldiers beating incredible odds to put up a defense against an overwhelmingly superior Russian military. You had what was whittled down to be a group of hungry, thirsty soldiers who had not had a rest in two months, who were out of ammunition, who were out of water, fight the vastly superior Russian military to a draw. This was a negotiated settlement, this was not a defeat that Putin wanted.

Last week, 2,439 Ukrainian fighters surrendered, although a group of more than 500 servicemen decided to remain inside the steelworks. Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky ordered the last of the Azovstal fighters to surrender a few days ago. \"Ukraine needs its heroes alive,\" he said.\n\nIn a video showing a line of unarmed Ukrainian servicemen, the Russian defence ministry has announced that the plant's underground facilities, where for months thousands of soldiers and civilians resisted the Russian offensive, came \"under the full control of the Russian armed forces\". This brings to an end one of the most brutal sieges of the invasion in Ukraine.\n\nSimilarly, the seizure of Azovstal is a major victory for the Kremlin. By gaining control of the coastal town of Mariupol, Moscow has strengthened its grip on the land corridor from Crimea - annexed by Russia in 2014 - to the Donbas. The seizure of the city on the Sea of Azov also represents Moscow's second major conquest since it seized Kherson, also on the Azov in early March.\n\nThe Ukrainian authorities, for their part, stress the great bravery and courage of the Ukrainian fighters. Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko assured that the defence of the steel mill would be taught in military schools in the future, Reuters reports. \"Those inside had no drinking water, only enough food for one meal a day and practically no medical supplies,\" he said.\n\n\"The senior military leadership has issued an order to save the lives and health of the garrison's servicemen and the completion of the city's defence,\" said Azov Battalion commander Denys Prokopenko, who praised Ukraine's 86-day defence against Russia.\n\nThe Azovstal resistance has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance against Russia. Equally, the West has praised the steadfastness of the fighters even in the appalling conditions they faced. \"Do you know what it's like to amputate a limb without anaesthetic? What you see in Hollywood horror movies is nothing compared to what the Azovstal defenders saw and endured,\" Gerashchenko added.\n\nZelensky also recounted how many air force pilots tried to move supplies to the last Azovstal defenders. \"Pilots intervened for several weeks knowing that 90 per cent of them would not return. They were going there to bring food, water, weapons and pick up the wounded. We lost many. They are heroes,\" he said.\n\nFollowing Azovstal's surrender, which Kiev calls a \"rescue\", Ukraine hopes to organise a prisoner-of-war exchange. Russia considers many of the soldiers at the plant to be \"neo-Nazi\" fighters, as a significant number were part of the Azov Battalion. For this reason, Russian politicians such as Vyacheslav Volodin have called for them to be tried on Russian territory \"for their crimes in the Donbas\", reports EFE.\n\nThe Russian military authorities have not specified the precise destination of the prisoners, although in previous days some of the Azovstal defenders were transferred to Russian territory and others to the area controlled by pro-Russian militias in the Donetsk region, the news agency adds.\n\nAfter months of heavy shelling, the 11 square kilometre Azovstal plant joins the ruins of the rest of the city of Mariupol, where 90% of the infrastructure has been destroyed according to Ukrainian sources. The town has been one of the worst hit by the war and more than 20,000 civilians are feared dead.\n\nHaving taken the plant and the city, Russia is redoubling its efforts to conquer territory in the Donbas, a region \"completely destroyed\" by the Russian army, according to Zelensky. As fighting rages in the east, the US Senate has approved a $40 billion package of military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "atalayar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Atalayar"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://atalayar.com/sites/default/files/noticias/aceria-azovstal.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 27, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 33, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7048208750", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "10:07:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T10:07:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T09:06:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.615686297416687, "url": "https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2022/05/20/ukraines-donbas-destroyed-as/", "title": "Ukraine's Donbas 'destroyed' as Russian artillery and aircraft step up strikes", "body": "KYIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Russian forces have bombarded areas of Ukraine's eastern Donbas from land and air, killing at least 13 civilians, Ukraine's military said on Friday, and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the assaults had turned the region into \"hell\".\n\nAs the war neared the three-month mark, the Russians were intensifying their efforts to subdue the Donbas region, the Ukrainian general staff said.\n\nThey had hit civilian infrastructure with \"massive\" artillery shelling, including multiple rocket-launchers, the general staff said in a statement. Russian aircraft had also struck at targets.\n\nRussian shelling in the Luhansk area of Donbas killed 13 civilians over the past 24 hours, regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said.

The war has caused global prices for grains, cooking oils, fuel and fertiliser to soar.\n\nThe EU said it is looking into ways of using the frozen assets of Russian oligarchs to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, while the United States has not ruled out possibly placing sanctions on countries that purchase Russian oil.\n\nHOLD OUT\n\nThe past week has seen Russia secure its biggest victory since the invasion began, with the Kyiv government ordering the defenders of a steelworks in Mariupol to stand down after a protracted siege.\n\nBritish military intelligence said as many as 1,700 soldiers were likely to have surrendered at the Azovstal steel factory, matching a similar number released on Thursday by Moscow.\n\nUkrainian officials, who have tried to arrange a prisoner swap, have declined to comment on the number, saying it could endanger rescue efforts.\n\nLate on Thursday, Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy head of the Azov Regiment defending the steelworks, released an 18-second video in which he said he and other commanders were still inside the plant.\n\n\"A certain operation is going on, the details of which I will not disclose,\" he said.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said it had registered hundreds of prisoners from Azovstal now held by Russia, but it has not given a precise number.\n\nThe leader of Russian-backed separatists in control of the area said nearly half of the fighters remained inside the steelworks.\n\nThe wounded were given medical treatment while those who were fit were taken to a penal colony and were being treated well, he said.\n\n(Reporting by Natalia Zinets and Max Hunder in Kyiv and a Reuters journalist in Mariupol; Additional reporting by Reuters bureaux; Writing by Stephen Coates and Angus MacSwan; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel)", "source": {"uri": "shorenewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shore News Network"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@shorenewsnetwork.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/Reuters_Direct_Media/USOnlineReportTopNews/tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI4I12O-BASEIMAGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.4666666666666667, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 8, "stanza_neu": 27, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 36, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7047927618", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "05:53:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T05:53:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T05:30:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.615686297416687, "url": "https://www.thedefensepost.com/2022/05/20/ukraine-slams-russian-campaign-donbas/", "title": "Ukraine Slams Russian Campaign in Donbas 'Hell'", "body": "The renewed Russian offensive in Ukraine's Donbas has turned the eastern region into \"hell\", President Volodymyr Zelensky said, as the United States approved a gargantuan $40-billion aid package for the country.\n\nAfter failing to take Kyiv following the launch of the invasion in February, Russia has focused its attacks on the south and east of Ukraine, devastating towns and villages with artillery fire.\n\nMoscow's forces have been trying to take complete control of Donbas, a Russian-speaking area that has been partially controlled since 2014 by pro-Kremlin separatists.\n\n\"In Donbas, the occupiers are trying to increase pressure,\" Zelensky said in his nightly address on Thursday.\n\n\"There's hell, and that's not an exaggeration.\"\n\nThe defense ministry in Kyiv said Thursday that Russian forces were preventing civilians in Donbas from fleeing to Ukrainian-controlled territory.\n\nIn Severodonetsk, 12 people were killed and another 40 wounded when Russian forces shelled the eastern city, the regional governor said.\n\nSeverodonetsk and its sister city Lysychansk make up the last pocket of Ukrainian resistance in the smaller of the two regions comprising the Donbas war zone.\n\nRussian forces have surrounded the two -- split by a river marking a central front of the war -- and are bombarding them to try and wear down resistance and starve residents of supplies.\n\nThe residents still in the now ghostly city are afraid to take more than a few steps outside their front door.\n\n\"We have no medicine left and a lot of sick people -- sick women -- need medicine.

It achieved a major step towards that goal this week, when Ukraine ordered the garrison in Mariupol, the main Donbas port, to stand down.\n\nNatalia Zarytska, wife of an Azovstal fighter who surrendered, said she had not heard from him since a Telegram message exchange two days ago. She believed he was still alive.\n\n\"The situation is really hard and horrible and my husband is on the way from one hell to another hell, from Azovstal steel plant to a prison, to captivity,\" Zarytska said in Istanbul, where she and other relatives lobbied Turkey to help save the fighters.\n\nThe Red Cross said it has registered hundreds of Ukrainians who surrendered at the plant as prisoners of war and Kyiv says it wants a prisoner swap. Moscow says the prisoners will be treated humanely, but Russian politicians have been quoted as saying some must be tried or even executed.\n\nRussian forces in Ukraine have been driven in recent weeks from the area surrounding Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv, their fastest retreat since being forced out of the north and the Kyiv region at the end of March.\n\nBut they still control a large swathe of the south and east, and the end of fighting in Mariupol means that territory is now largely unbroken.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's aim to boost its war effort, the parliament in Moscow said it would consider letting Russians over 40 and foreigners over 30 join the military.\n\nThe past week has also seen Sweden and Finland apply to join NATO, although Turkey has threatened to block them, accusing the Nordic countries of harboring Kurdish militants.\n\nAfter weeks of threatening to retaliate, Putin said this week Finnish or Swedish NATO membership did not represent a threat unless the alliance sends new weapons or troops.

(AFP)\n\nThe West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine on Friday, as Russia shifted forces freed up by the imminent fall of the pulverized port city of Mariupol and fighting raged in the country's industrial heartland in the east.\n\nUkraine said its troops repelled a Russian attack in the grinding, back-and-forth battle for the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking expanse of coal mines and factories that the Kremlin is bent on capturing.\n\nBattered by their nearly three-month siege of the Mariupol, Russian troops need time to regroup, Britain's Defense Ministry said in an assessment, but they may not get it.\n\nWith the battle winding down for the steel plant that represented the last bastion of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol, Russia is continuing to pull back forces there, and their commanders are under pressure to quickly send them elsewhere in the Donbas, according to the British.\n\n\"That means that Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition,\" the ministry said.\n\nAn undisclosed number of Ukrainian soldiers remained at the Azovstal steel plant. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said more than 1,900 surrendered in recent days. Also remaining at the plant were the bodies of soldiers who defended it while tying down Russian forces.\n\nDenis Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, which had led the defense of the plant, called them \"fallen heroes.\"\n\n\"I hope soon relatives and the whole of Ukraine will be able to bury the fighters with honors,\" he said.\n\nPro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas for the past eight years and held a considerable swath of it before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. But the effort by Russian President Vladimir Putin's troops to take more territory there has been slow-going.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, the British Defense Ministry said.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine continued to blast away at targets, some of them civilian.\n\nIn the village of Velyka Kostromka, west of the Donbas, explosions in the middle of the night Thursday shook Iryna Martsyniuk's house to its foundations. Roof timbers splintered and windows shattered, sending shards of glass into a wall near three sleeping children.\n\n\"There were flashes everywhere,\" she said. \"The windows smashed, there was smoke everywhere.\"\n\nShe grabbed the children and ran toward the home's entrance. \"But the corridor wasn't there anymore. Instead, we saw the starry night,\" she said.\n\nThe family finally was able to climb out of the wrecked house through a back window. They ran down the road to a neighbor's home, where they hid in the basement.\n\nAround 20 other houses were damaged and two people were lightly injured, said Olha Shaytanova, the head of the village.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\n- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n- Putin said his country has faced a tide of cyberattacks from the West but has managed to fend them off. He charged that \"an outright aggression has been unleashed against Russia, a war has been waged in the information space.\"\n\nOn Friday, a governor in the Donbas said Russian forces attacked the cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk. Twelve people were killed and more than 60 houses destroyed across the region, Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said in a Telegram post.\n\nBut the attack on Severodonetsk was unsuccessful, according to both Haidai and Ukraine's military, who said Russia took losses and retreated. Their claims could not be independently verified.\n\n\"It is hell there, and that's not an exaggeration,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said of the campaign.

There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency Tass quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly have tried to characterize the fighters who holed up in the Azovstal steel plant as neo-Nazis. Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance, and with it completing Moscow's long-sought goal of controlling the city, home to a strategic seaport.\n\nUkraine's military this week told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe impact of Russia's declared victory on the broader war in Ukraine remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict, which began with the Russian invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base in Black Sea region of Odesa as well as significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn its morning operational report, the Ukrainian military general staff reported heavy fighting in much of eastern Ukraine, including the areas of Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nSince failing to reach and capture Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Russia focused its offensive in the country's eastern industrial heartland. The Russia-backed separatists have controlled parts of the Donbas region since 2014, and Moscow wants to expand the territory under its control.\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockkaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nAs the end drew near at the steel plant, wives of fighters who had held out told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, the wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she shared the words her husband wrote her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nThe wife of another fighter, Natalia Zaritskaya, said her husband reported earlier this week that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived and most were seriously wounded.\n\n\"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly,\" Zaritskaya said.\n\nThe seasize steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been a battleground for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters held out with the help of air drops of supplies, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant and save themselves.\n\nRussia said the Azov Regiment's commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred for him.\n\nNo evidence of Ukrainian antipathy toward the nationalist regiment has emerged. The Kremlin has seized on the regiment's far-right origins in its drive to to cast the invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial.\n\nCapturing Mariupol furthers Russia's quest to essentially create a land bridge from Russia via much of the Donbas area bordering Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe city's seizure also helps Russian leader Putin offset some stinging setbacks, including the failure to take over Kyiv, the sinking of the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea and continued resistance that has stalled the offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nWith Mariupol under Russian control, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in the city, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theater where civilians had taken cover.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAt one point in the siege, Pope Francis lamented that Mariupol had become a \"city of martyrs.\"\n\nAn estimated 100,000 of the 450,000 people who resided there before the war remain. Many, trapped by Russia's siege, were left without food, water and electricity.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the steel plant during humanitarian cease-fires. They spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nThe chief executive of Metinvest, a multinational company which owns the Azovstal plant and another steel mill, Ilyich, in Mariupol, spoke of the city's devastation in an interview published Saturday in Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to clean it (the city) up to hide their crimes,'' the newspaper quoted Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov as saying. \"The inhabitants are trying to make the city function, to make water supplies work again.\"\n\n\"But the sewer system is damaged, there has been flooding, and infections are feared\" from drinking the water, he said.\n\nThe Ilyich steelworks still has some intact infrastructure, but if the Russians try to get it running, Ukrainians will refuse to return to their jobs there, Ryzhenkov said.\n\n\"We will never work under Russian occupation,'' Ryzhenkov said.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

The verdict is due on May 23.\n\nShishimarin told the court on Friday that he was \"truly sorry\" but his lawyer said in closing arguments that the young soldier was \"not guilty\" of premeditated murder and war crimes.\n\nWhile Ukrainian forces fended off the Russian offensive around Kyiv, helped by a large infusion of Western arms, both eastern Ukraine and Mariupol in the south have borne the brunt of a ferocious ground and artillery attack.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's government received a fresh boost as the US Congress approved a $40-billion (38-billion-euro) aid package, including funds to enhance Ukraine's armoured vehicle fleet and air defence system.\n\nAnd meeting in Germany, G7 industrialised nations pledged $19.8 billion to shore up Ukraine's shattered public finances.\n\nUkraine sorely needs enhanced capability to fend off the kind of onslaught Russia is waging in the eastern region of Donbas, a Russian-speaking area that has been partially controlled by pro-Kremlin separatists since 2014.\n\n\"In Donbas, the occupiers are trying to increase pressure,\" Zelensky said in his nightly video address late on Thursday. \"There's hell -- and that's not an exaggeration.\"\n\nIn the eastern city of Severodonetsk, 12 people were killed and another 40 wounded by Russian shelling, the regional governor said.\n\n- Burial with honours -\n\nZelensky described the bombardment of Severodonetsk as \"brutal and absolutely pointless\", as residents cowering in basements described an unending ordeal of terror.\n\nThe city forms part of the last pocket of Ukrainian resistance in Lugansk, which along with the neighbouring region of Donetsk comprises the Donbas war zone.\n\nRussian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said his forces' campaign in Lugansk was \"nearing completion\".\n\nAlso apparently complete is the capture of the Azovstal steelworks, a totemic symbol of Ukraine's dogged resistance since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion on February 24 to remove a Western-leaning, \"Nazi\" threat on his borders.\n\nRussia released a video appearing to show exhausted Ukrainian soldiers trudging out of the sprawling steel plant, after weeks during which the besieged defenders and civilians huddled in tunnels, enduring shortages of food, water and medicine.\n\n\"The higher military command has given the order to save the lives of the soldiers of our garrison and to stop defending the city,\" Azov battalion commander Denys Prokopenko said in a video on Telegram.\n\nHe said efforts continued to remove killed fighters from the plant.\n\n\"I now hope that soon, the families and all of Ukraine will be able to bury their fighters with honours,\" he said.\n\nUkraine is hoping to exchange the surrendering Azovstal soldiers for Russian prisoners. But in Donetsk, the pro-Kremlin authorities are in turn threatening to put some of them on trial.\n\n\"Our expectation is ... that all prisoners of war will be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention and the law of war,\" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said in Washington.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has cast the Ukraine war as part of a great US-led struggle of democracy against authoritarianism.\n\nBiden offered \"full, total, complete backing\" to Finland and Sweden in their bid to join the NATO military alliance, when he gave their leaders a red-carpet welcome at the White House on Thursday.\n\n- 'We're not idiots' -\n\nBut all 30 existing NATO members need to agree on any new entrants and Turkey has condemned the historically non-aligned Nordic neighbours' alleged toleration of Kurdish militants.\n\nShoigu said the Kremlin would respond to any NATO expansion by creating more military bases in western Russia.\n\nAs well as redrawing the security map of Europe, the conflict has sent shockwaves through the global economy, especially in energy and food markets.\n\nRussia and Ukraine produce 30 percent of the world's wheat supply and the war has sent food prices surging. Russia is also a major exporter of fertiliser.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the war could trigger years of \"famine\" in poorer parts of the world.\n\nWashington urged Russia to allow exports of Ukrainian grain held up at Black Sea ports.\n\nBut former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev blamed the West.\n\n\"On the one hand, insane sanctions are being imposed against us. On the other hand, they are demanding food supplies,\" he said. \"Things don't work like that.

The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out in the plant, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire before their government ordered them to abandon its defence and save their lives.\n\nThe Azovstal complex covers 11 square kilometres and is threaded with about 24 kilometres of tunnels and bunkers. Earlier in May, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian ceasefires.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed military victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a quick and easy victory for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of its forces to refocus on battles in Eastern Ukraine and even the sinking of Russia's flagship of its Black Sea fleet, the Moskva.\n\nMariupol is located in Donetsk, which, along with Luhansk, make up the Donbas -- a mostly Russian-speaking eastern region that has been partly held by Moscow-backed separatists since 2014.\n\nMilitary analysts say the city's capture at this point holds more symbolic importance than anything else, since Mariupol is already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the drawn-out fighting have already left.\n\nRussia had sought control of Mariupol, on the coast of the Sea of Azov, to complete a land corridor from the Donbas to the Crimean Peninsula, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the growing battle for control of the Donbas region. It would also deprive Ukraine of a vital port.\n\nThe city endured some of the worst suffering of the war. An estimated 100,000 people remained from a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Constant bombardment has left behind shattered and charred buildings in row after row of destroyed apartment blocks and ruined neighbourhoods.\n\nRussian forces on Friday continued attacking the cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk in Ukraine's eastern region of Luhansk to try to cut the area off from the rest of Ukraine, the region's governor said.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces were especially focused on the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway, the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The road is extremely important because it's the only connection to other regions of the country,\" he said via email. \"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region.\"\n\nRussian forces shelled the road constantly from multiple directions, but Ukrainian armoured transports were still able to get through, Haidai said.\n\nMoscow's troops have been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas. One of Friday's attacks was on a school in Severodonetsk that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, Haidai said. Three adults were killed, he said on messaging app Telegram.\n\nAccording to Haidai, 12 people were killed in Severodonetsk. It was not immediately clear if that included the three at the school. In addition, more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he said.\n\nRussian forces now control 90 per cent of Luhansk, Haidai said, but he also noted the attack on Severodonetsk failed -- \"the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated.\" His account could not be independently verified.\n\nHaidai said another city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" and \"its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nPro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas for the past eight years and held a considerable swath of it before Russia's invasion. But the effort by Putin's troops to take more territory there has been slow-going.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, according to Britain's Defence Ministry.\n\nRussian forces elsewhere in Ukraine continued to blast away at targets, some of them civilian.\n\nIn the village of Velyka Kostromka, west of the Donbas, explosions in the middle of the night Thursday shook Iryna Martsyniuk's house to its foundation. Roof timbers splintered and windows shattered, sending shards of glass into a wall near three sleeping children.\n\n\"There were flashes everywhere,\" Martsyniuk said. \"There was smoke everywhere.\"\n\nShe said she grabbed the children and ran toward the home's entrance, \"but the corridor wasn't there anymore. Instead, we saw the starry night.\"\n\nThey ran down the road to a neighbour's home, where they hid in the basement.\n\nAround 20 other houses were damaged and two people were lightly wounded, said Olha Shaytanova, head of the village.\n\nPutin says his country has faced a barrage of cyberattacks from the West amid the invasion of Ukraine but has successfully fended them off.\n\nSpeaking Friday to members of Russia's Security Council, Putin noted that \"the challenges in this area have become even more pressing, serious and extensive.\"\n\nHe charged that \"an outright aggression has been unleashed against Russia, a war has been waged in the information space.\"\n\nPutin added that \"the cyber-aggression against us, the same as the attack on Russia by sanctions in general, has failed.\"\n\nHe ordered officials to \"perfect and enhance the mechanisms of ensuring information security at critically important industrial facilities which have a direct bearing on our country's defensive capability, and the stable development of the economic and social spheres.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.6461351.1653074708!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ukraine-crisis-mariupol.JPG", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 18, "stanza_neu": 30, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 48, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7048234435", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "10:27:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T10:27:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T10:27:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.615686297416687, "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/world/russia-central-asia/article/3178544/ukraine-war-zelensky-says-donbas-destroyed-and-now", "title": "Zelensky says Donbas is now \u2018hell\u2019; Russian strikes kill 13 civilians", "body": "Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Friday that Moscow was nearing full control of the separatist region of Luhansk in eastern Ukraine\n\nBritish military intelligence said on Friday that Russia is likely to further reinforce its operations in Donbas once it finally secures the southern port city of Mariupol\n\nRussian forces have bombarded areas of Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas from land and air, killing at least 13 civilians, Ukraine\u2019s military said on Friday, and President Volodymyr Zelensky said the assaults had turned the region into \u201chell\u201d.\n\nAs the war neared the three-month mark, the Russians were intensifying their efforts to subdue the Donbas region, the Ukrainian general staff said.\n\nThey had hit civilian infrastructure with \u201cmassive\u201d artillery shelling, including multiple rocket-launchers, the general staff said in a statement.

And all this will return - since this is our territory,\" he said on Saturday.\n\nFull control of Mariupol could give Russia command of an overland route linking the Crimea peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014, with mainland Russia and the areas of eastern Ukraine that are held by pro-Russia separatists.\n\nLuhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said in a social media post early on Saturday that Russia was trying to destroy the city of Sievierodonetsk, with fighting taking place on the outskirts of the city.\n\n\"Shelling continues from morning to the evening and also throughout the night,\" Gaidai said in a video post on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nDespite losing ground elsewhere in recent weeks, Russian forces have advanced on the Luhansk front.\n\nSievierodonetsk and its twin Lysychansk across the Siverskiy Donets River form the eastern part of a Ukrainian-held pocket that Russia has been trying to overrun since mid-April after failing to capture Kyiv.\n\nGAS DISPUTE\n\nRussia's state gas company, Gazprom (GAZP.MM), said it had halted gas exports to Finland after it refused to agree to Russian demands to pay for Russian gas in roubles because of Western sanctions imposed over the invasion of Ukraine. read more\n\nFinland and Sweden applied this week to join the NATO military alliance, a decision spurred by the Ukraine war.\n\nFinnish state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum, the Finnish government and individual gas consuming companies in Finland have said they were prepared for a shutdown of Russian flows and that the country will manage without.\n\nMost European supply contracts are denominated in euros or dollars and Moscow cut off gas to Bulgaria and Poland last month after they refused to comply with the new payment terms.\n\nIn addition to trying to isolate Russia through sanctions, Western nations have stepped up weapons supplies to Ukraine.\n\nKyiv got another huge boost on Saturday when U.S. President Joe Biden signed a bill to provide nearly $40 billion in military, economic and humanitarian aid to the country.\n\n\"Look forward to new, powerful defense assistance.

The city and the steelworks where Ukrainian fighters have held off the Russian assault for weeks have become a symbol of Ukraine's stoic resistance and surprising ability to stymie a much larger force.\n\nOn Friday, a number of soldiers -- just how many was unclear -- were still holed up in the Azovstal plant, following the surrender of more than 1,900 soldiers in recent days, according to the latest figure from Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. Efforts to remove the dead from the battle were also underway, according to Denis Prokopenko, the commander of the Azov Regiment, which is among those defending the plant.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But the British assessment indicated Russian commanders are under pressure to quickly send them elsewhere in the Donbas.\n\n\"That means that Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition,\" the ministry said.\n\nThe Donbas is now President Vladimir Putin's focus after his troops failed to take the capital in the early days of the war. Pro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces for eight years in the region and held a considerable swath of it before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion.\n\nBut the effort to take more territory there has been slow-going. In a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, the British Defense Ministry said.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state-owned energy company said. Poland and Bulgaria were cut off late last month, as Moscow tries to use its energy exports to hit back at Western countries that are helping Ukraine. The moves comes after Finland and Sweden applied for membership in the NATO alliance, driven by security concerns in the wake of Russia's invasion.\n\n-- A young Russian soldier, accused of killing a Ukrainian civilian, awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old soldier in a Russian tank unit, has pleaded guilty, but the prosecution still presented its evidence, in line with Ukrainian law. Shishimarin told the court Thursday that he shot 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov after he was ordered to -- and apologized to the widow.\n\n-- The Group of Seven leading economies and global financial institutions agreed this week to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's public finances, bringing the total aid to $19.8 billion, Germany's finance minister said Friday. Western financial and arms support have been critical to Ukraine's ability to defend itself.\n\nOn Friday, a governor in the Donbas said Russian forces attacked the cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk. Twelve people were killed, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said in a Telegram post.\n\nBut the attack on Severodonetsk was unsuccessful. Both Haidai and Ukraine's General Staff of the military said Russia took losses and retreated. Their reports could not be independently verified.\n\nStill, Russia's struggles in the east only seemed to translate into an intensifying offensive that is inflicting increasing suffering.\n\n\"It is hell there, and that's not an exaggeration,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said of the campaign.\n\n\"The brutal and completely senseless bombardment of Severodonetsk. Twelve dead and dozens wounded there in just one day,\" he said in his nightly video address Thursday night to the nation.\n\nWhile Mariupol was a target from the start of the invasion and has been under effective Russian control for some time, a group of Ukrainian fighters have held out in the sprawling steel plant -- symbolic of the way Ukrainian forces have managed to grind down the Russian troops.\n\nWhile hundreds of fighters have left, in a brief video message, the deputy commander of the Azov Regiment said he and other fighters were still inside.\n\n\"An operation is underway, the details of which I will not announce,\" Svyatoslav Palamar said.\n\nWhile Ukraine has expressed hope for a prisoner exchange for those who have surrendered, Russian authorities have threatened to possibly try for war crimes some of the Azovstal fighters.\n\nThe far-right origins of the Azov Regiment have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast Russia's invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine.\n\nThe International Red Cross said this week that it has registered hundreds of fighters who left the plant as prisoners of war, as part of its role in ensuring their humane treatment under the Geneva Conventions. The organization revealed Friday that it has visited prisoners of war on \"all sides\" since the start of the fighting. That allows it to pass on information to families about their loved ones.\n\nThe organization did not say how many families had been informed about their relatives or where the visits took place.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

In addition, more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nRussian forces now control 90 percent of Luhansk, but the attack on Severodonetsk failed -- \"the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated,\" Haidai said. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nPro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas for the past eight years and held a considerable swath of it before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. But the effort by Putin's troops to take more territory there has been slow-going.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, Britain's Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian forces elsewhere in Ukraine continued to blast away at targets, some of them civilian.\n\nIn the village of Velyka Kostromka, west of the Donbas, explosions in the middle of the night Thursday shook Iryna Martsyniuk's house to its foundations. Roof timbers splintered and windows shattered, sending shards of glass into a wall near three sleeping children.\n\n\"There were flashes everywhere,\" she said. \"There was smoke everywhere.\" She grabbed the children and ran toward the home's entrance, \"but the corridor wasn't there anymore. Instead, we saw the starry night.\"\n\nThey ran down the road to a neighbor's home, where they hid in the basement.\n\nAround 20 other houses were damaged and two people were lightly wounded, said Olha Shaytanova, head of the village.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

She believed he was still alive.\n\n\"The situation is really hard and horrible and my husband is on the way from one hell to another hell, from Azovstal steel plant to a prison, to captivity,\" Zarytska said in Istanbul, where she and other relatives lobbied Turkey to help save the fighters.\n\nThe Red Cross said it had registered hundreds of Ukrainians who surrendered at the plant as prisoners of war and Kyiv says it wants a prisoner swap.

Moscow says the prisoners will be treated humanely, but Russian politicians have been quoted as saying some must be tried or even executed.\n\nGAS DISPUTE\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's Gazprom halted gas exports to neighbouring Finland on Saturday after it refused to agree to Russian demands to pay for Russian gas supplies in roubles because of Western sanctions imposed over the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe move comes days after Finland and Sweden decided to apply to join the NATO military alliance, a decision spurred by the Ukraine war.\n\nFinnish state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum, the Finnish government and individual gas consuming companies in Finland have said they were prepared for a shutdown of Russian flows and that the country will manage without.\n\nMost European supply contracts are denominated in euros or dollars and Moscow cut off gas to Bulgaria and Poland last month after they refused to comply with the new payment terms.\n\nIn addition to trying to isolate Russia through sanctions, Western nations have stepped up weapons supplies to Ukraine since the invasion. Kyiv got another huge boost on Saturday when U.S. President Joe Biden signed a bill to provide nearly $40 billion in military, economic and humanitarian aid to the country.\n\nMoscow says Western arms deliveries for Kyiv, and the imposition of drastic sanctions amount to a \"proxy war\" by the United States and its allies.\n\nThe Russian military said on Saturday it had destroyed a major consignment of Western arms in Ukraine's Zhytomyr region, west of Kyiv, using sea-launched Kalibr cruise missiles.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the report, which also said Russian missiles had struck fuel storage facilities near Odesa on the Black Sea coast and shot down two Ukrainian Su-25 aircraft and 14 drones.\n\nPutin says Russian troops are engaged in a \"special military operation\" to demilitarise Ukraine and rid it of radical anti-Russian nationalists. Western countries call it an unprovoked war of aggression.\n\nThousands of people in Ukraine have been killed and urban areas have been shattered in the war. Almost a third of Ukraine's people have fled their homes, including more than 6 million who have left the country.\n\nOFFENSIVE IN LUHANSK\n\nRussia, which announced in late March it was focusing its military efforts on taking control of Donbas, launched what appeared to be a major assault to seize remaining Ukrainian-held territory in Luhansk.\n\nLuhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said in a social media post early on Saturday that Russia was trying to destroy the city of Sievierodonetsk, with fighting taking place on the outskirts of the city.\n\n\"Shelling continues from morning to the evening and also throughout the night,\" Gaidai said in a video post on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nDespite losing ground elsewhere in recent weeks, Russian forces have advanced on the Luhansk front.\n\nThe city of Sievierodonetsk and its twin Lysychansk across the Siverskiy Donets River form the eastern part of a Ukrainian-held pocket that Russia has been trying to overrun since mid-April after failing to capture Kyiv.\n\n(Reporting by Natalia Zinets, Max Hunder, Tom Balmforth in Kyiv and Reuters bureaux; Writing by Madeline Chambers, Patricia Zengerle and Richard Pullin; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien, Bradley Perrett and Frances Kerry)", "source": {"uri": "shorenewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shore News Network"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@shorenewsnetwork.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/Reuters_Direct_Media/USOnlineReportTopNews/tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI4K011-BASEIMAGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 24, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 35, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049211346", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "05:42:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T05:42:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T05:41:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "url": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1690691", "title": "Kyiv orders troops to lay down arms in Mariupol", "body": "KYIV: Ukraine on Friday ordered its last troops holed up in Mariupol's besieged Azovstal steelworks to lay down their arms after nearly three months of desperate resistance against a ferocious Russian assault.\n\nRussia's flattening of the strategic port city has drawn multiple accusations of war crimes, including a deadly attack on a maternity ward, and Ukraine has begun a reckoning for captured Russian troops.\n\nThe first post-invasion trial of a Russian soldier for war crimes neared its climax in Kyiv, after 21-year-old sergeant Vadim Shishimarin admitted to killing an unarmed civilian early in the offensive.

There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency Tass quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly have tried to characterize the fighters who holed up in the Azovstal steel plant as neo-Nazis. Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance, and with it completing Moscow's long-sought goal of controlling the city, home to a strategic seaport.\n\nUkraine's military this week told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe end of the battle for Mariupol would help Putin offset some stinging setbacks, including the failure of Russian troops to take over Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, the sinking of the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea and the continued resistance that has stalled an offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe impact of Russia's declared victory on the broader war in Ukraine remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict, which began with the Russian invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base in Black Sea region of Odesa as well as significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn its morning operational report, the Ukrainian military general staff reported heavy fighting in much of eastern Ukraine, including the areas of Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nSince failing to capture Kyiv, Russia focused its offensive in the country's eastern industrial heartland. The Russia-backed separatists have controlled parts of the Donbas region since 2014, and Moscow wants to expand the territory under its control.\n\nTaking Mariupol furthers Russia's quest to essentially create a land bridge from Russia via much of the Donbas area bordering Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nUkraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, expressed gratitude to his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, who signed off Saturday on a fresh, $40 billion infusion of aid for the war-ravaged nation. Half of the funding provides military assistance.\n\nZelenskyy, in remarks to the traumatized nation late Friday, demanded anew that Russia pay \"in one way or another for everything it has destroyed in Ukraine. Every burned house. Every ruined school, ruined hospital. Each blown up house of culture and infrastructure facility. Every destroyed enterprise.\"\n\n\"Of course, the Russian state will not even recognize that it is an aggressor,\" he continued. \"But its recognition is not required.\"\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nAs the end drew near at the steel plant, wives of fighters who had held out told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, the wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she shared the words her husband wrote her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nThe seaside steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been a battleground for weeks. Drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, the dwindling group of outgunned fighters held out with the help of air drops before their government ordered them to abandon the plant.\n\nZelenskyy revealed in an interview published Friday that Ukrainian helicopter pilots braved Russian anti-aircraft fire to ferry in medicine, food and water to the steel mill as well as to retrieve bodies and rescue wounded fighters.\n\nA \"very large\" number of the pilots died on their daring missions, he said. \"They are absolutely heroic people, who knew that it would be difficult, knew that to fly would be almost impossible,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nRussia claimed that the Azov Regiment's commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred for him, but no evidence of Ukrainian antipathy toward the nationalist regiment has emerged.\n\nThe Kremlin has seized on the regiment's far-right origins in its drive to to cast the invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Russian authorities have threatened to put some of the steel mill's defenders on trial for alleged war crimes and put them on trial.\n\nWith Russia controlling the city, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in Mariupol, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theater where hundreds of civilians had taken cover.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAt one point in the siege, Pope Francis lamented that Mariupol had become a \"city of martyrs.\"\n\nAn estimated 100,000 of the 450,000 people who resided there before the war remain. Many, trapped by Russia's siege, were left without food, water and electricity.\n\nThe chief executive of Metinvest, a multinational company which owns the Azovstal plant and another steel mill, Ilyich, in Mariupol, spoke of the city's devastation in an interview published Saturday in Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to clean it (the city) up to hide their crimes,'' the newspaper quoted Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov as saying. \"The inhabitants are trying to make the city function, to make water supplies work again.\"\n\n\"But the sewer system is damaged, there has been flooding, and infections are feared\" from drinking the water, he said.\n\nThe Ilyich steelworks still has some intact infrastructure, but if the Russians try to get it running, Ukrainians will refuse to return to their jobs there, Ryzhenkov said.\n\n\"We will never work under Russian occupation,'' Ryzhenkov said.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

Credits: Video - Newshub; Images - Reuters\n\nThe last Ukrainian forces holed up in Mariupol's smashed Azovstal steelworks surrendered on Friday, (local time) Russia's defense ministry said, ending the most destructive siege of the war as Moscow fought to cement control over the Donbas region.\n\nHours before Russia's announcement on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the last defenders at the steelworks had been told by Ukraine's military that they could get out and save their lives.\n\nRussia said there were 531 members of the last group that had given up. \"The territory of the Azovstal metallurgical plant... has been completely liberated,\" the ministry said in a statement, adding that a total of 2,439 defenders had surrendered in the past few days.\n\nThe Ukrainians did not immediately confirm those figures.\n\nRussia also launched what appeared to be a major assault to seize the last remaining Ukrainian-held territory in the province of Luhansk, one of two southeastern Ukrainian provinces Moscow proclaims as independent states.\n\n\"The Russian army has started very intensive destruction of the town of Sievierodonetsk, the intensity of shelling doubled, they are shelling residential quarters, destroying house by house,\" Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said on his Telegram channel.\n\n\"We do not know how many people died, because it is simply impossible to go through and look at every apartment,\" he said.\n\nThe city of Sievierodonetsk and its twin Lyshchansk across the Siverskiy Donets river form the eastern part of a Ukrainian-held pocket Russia has been trying to overrun since mid-April after failing to capture the capital Kyiv.\n\nUkraine's general staff said it had pushed back an offensive on Sievierodonetsk, part of what it described as major Russian operations along a stretch of the frontline.\n\nDespite losing ground elsewhere in recent weeks, Russian forces have advanced on the Luhansk front, in what some military analysts view as a major push to achieve scaled-down war aims of capturing more territory claimed by pro-Russian rebels.\n\n\"This will be the critical next few weeks of the conflict,\" said Mathieu Boulegue, an expert at London's Chatham House think tank. \"And it depends on how effective they are at conquering Sievierodonetsk and the lands across it.\"\n\nIn Moscow, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the \"liberation of the Luhansk People's Republic\" would be over soon.\n\nThe end of the Mariupol siege was an important symbolic moment for Russia, after a series of setbacks since the invasion began on Feb. 24, but it came at the cost of massive destruction.\n\nZelenskiy described the conditions in the Donbas, which includes Luhansk and the neighbouring Donetsk province where Mariupol is located, as \"hell\" and said the region had been \"completely destroyed\" by Russia.\n\nVICTORY\n\nCapturing Luhansk and Donetsk would allow Moscow to claim a victory after announcing last month that this was now its objective. It achieved a major step towards that goal this week, when Ukraine ordered the garrison in Mariupol, the main Donbas port, to stand down.\n\nNatalia Zarytska, wife of an Azovstal fighter who surrendered, said she had not heard from him since a Telegram message exchange two days ago. She believed he was still alive.\n\n\"The situation is really hard and horrible and my husband is on the way from one hell to another hell, from Azovstal steel plant to a prison, to captivity,\" Zarytska said in Istanbul, where she and other relatives lobbied Turkey to help save the fighters.\n\nThe Red Cross said it has registered hundreds of Ukrainians who surrendered at the plant as prisoners of war and Kyiv says it wants a prisoner swap. Moscow says the prisoners will be treated humanely, but Russian politicians have been quoted as saying some must be tried or even executed.\n\nRussian forces in Ukraine have been driven in recent weeks from the area surrounding Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv, their fastest retreat since being forced out of the north and the Kyiv region at the end of March.\n\nBut they still control a large swathe of the south and east, and the end of fighting in Mariupol means that territory is now largely unbroken.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's aim to boost its war effort, the parliament in Moscow said it would consider letting Russians over 40 and foreigners over 30 join the military.\n\nThe past week has also seen Sweden and Finland apply to join NATO, although Turkey has threatened to block them, accusing the Nordic countries of harbouring Kurdish militants.\n\nAfter weeks of threatening to retaliate, Putin said this week Finnish or Swedish NATO membership did not represent a threat unless the alliance sends new weapons or troops. Nevertheless, Shoigu said on Friday Moscow planned to beef up its forces nearby in response to what he called new threats.\n\nReuters", "source": {"uri": "newshub.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newshub"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@newshub.co.nz", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2022/05/ukraine-invasion-siege-ends-at-ukraine-s-mariupol-steelworks-russia-seeks-control-of-donbas/_jcr_content/par/video/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1653158713016/Ukrainesteelworks_Reuters_1120.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 21, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 33, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049912709", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "21:21:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T21:21:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T21:21:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6078431606292725, "url": "https://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-2679121", "title": "Russia cuts off gas to Finland amid wider push into Ukraine's east", "body": "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian troops pressed their offensive into the Donbas region on Saturday, aiming to encircle the easternmost point of Ukrainian control in what one official said would be a repeat of Moscow's assault on the beleaguered city of Mariupol.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow cut off natural gas exports to Finland, and the Russian defense ministry said it destroyed a consignment of U.S.- and European-supplied weapons meant for Ukrainian fighters in the Donbas.\n\nLuhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Saturday that Russian troops were throwing \"all their forces and efforts\" into assaulting Severodonetsk in Luhansk province, aiming to cut off the main supply route to the city. Six people were killed and three others wounded in Russian attacks on Severodonetsk, Hadai said, along with at least two others killed in shelling on neighboring towns.\n\n\"The Russians are destroying Severodonetsk, like Mariupol. The enemy's plans are to surround the area or turn it into a fire ... ,\" Haidai said in a statement on Telegram on Saturday, adding that Ukrainian forces had defended the city against 11 enemy incursions.\n\nA Russian breakthrough in Luhansk would enable an attack on Donetsk and Kharkiv provinces, he added.\n\n\"This is the difficult fate of Luhansk region, not to allow the Russians to move forward,\" he said. Later Saturday, Haidai said the Russians had destroyed a bridge between Severodonetsk and its twin city Lysychansk across the Siverskyi Donets River, which will make reinforcing the area more difficult.\n\nThe grinding advance in the east comes one day after Russia claimed its biggest victory in its almost-three-month assault: the full capture of the Azovstal steelworks plant, the labyrinthine underground network of tunnels that became Ukraine's last stand in the Black Sea coastal city of Mariupol, along with the surrender of what the Russian defense ministry said were 2,439 Ukrainian fighters.\n\nAlthough Kyiv said it would bring back its troops via prisoner exchanges, the Kremlin has yet to comment on their fate. In recent days, Russian lawmakers in the Duma called for prison terms and even capital punishment for members of the Azov Regiment, a far-right Ukrainian military unit with neo-Nazi roots whose fighters emerged as the Azovstal plant's most stubborn defenders. The history of the group has been seized on by the Kremlin to falsely claim it is fighting \"Nazis\" in Ukraine.\n\nMariupol has been a target of Russia's invasion virtually from the start of the war.

Luhansk is part of the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking eastern expanse of coal mines and factories that Russian President Vladimir Putin is bent on capturing.\n\n\"The liberation of the Luhansk People's Republic is nearing completion,\" Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu declared, referring to the breakaway state proclaimed by pro-Moscow separatists in 2014 and recognized by the Kremlin.\n\nIn Mariupol, the strategic port in the southern corner of the Donbas, Russian troops worn down by their nearly three-month siege of the city may not get the time they need to regroup, Britain's Defense Ministry said.\n\nWith the battle winding down for the Azovstal steel plant that represented the last bastion of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol, Russia is continuing to pull back forces there, and their commanders are under pressure to quickly send them elsewhere in the Donbas, according to the British.\n\n\"That means that Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition,\" the ministry said.\n\nAn undisclosed number of Ukrainian soldiers remained at the Azovstal steel plant. Russia said more than 1,900 had surrendered in recent days. Also remaining at the plant were the bodies of soldiers who defended it while tying down Russian forces.\n\nDenis Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, which led the defense of the plant, called them \"fallen heroes.\"\n\n\"I hope soon relatives and the whole of Ukraine will be able to bury the fighters with honors,\" he said.\n\nWives of fighters who held out at the steelworks spoke emotionally about what may have been their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\nMeanwhile, fighting intensified deeper in the Donbas.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces were especially focused on the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway, the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The road is extremely important because it's the only connection to other regions of the country,\" he said via email. \"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region.\"\n\nRussian forces shelled the road constantly from multiple directions, but Ukrainian armored transports were still able to get through, Haidai added.\n\nMoscow's troops have been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas. One of Friday's attacks was on a school in Severodonetsk that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, Haidai said. Three adults were killed, he said on Telegram.\n\nTwelve people were killed in Severodonetsk, Haidai said. It was not immediately clear if that included the three at the school. In addition, more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nRussian forces now control 90 percent of Luhansk, but the attack on Severodonetsk failed -- \"the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated,\" Haidai said. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nPro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas for the past eight years and held a considerable swath of it before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. But the effort by Putin's troops to take more territory there has been slow-going.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, Britain's Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian forces elsewhere in Ukraine continued to blast away at targets, some of them civilian.\n\nIn the village of Velyka Kostromka, west of the Donbas, explosions in the middle of the night Thursday shook Iryna Martsyniuk's house to its foundations. Roof timbers splintered and windows shattered, sending shards of glass into a wall near three sleeping children.\n\n\"There were flashes everywhere,\" she said. \"There was smoke everywhere.\" She grabbed the children and ran toward the home's entrance, \"but the corridor wasn't there anymore. Instead, we saw the starry night.\"\n\nThey ran down the road to a neighbor's home, where they hid in the basement.\n\nAround 20 other houses were damaged and two people were lightly injured, said Olha Shaytanova, head of the village.\n\n___\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

Serhiy Haidai said Saturday that Russian troops were throwing \"all their forces and efforts\" into assaulting Severodonetsk in Luhansk province, aiming to cut off the main supply route to the city. Six people were killed and three others wounded in Russian attacks on Severodonetsk, Haidai said, along with at least two others killed in shelling on neighboring towns.\n\n\"The Russians are destroying Severodonetsk, like Mariupol. The enemy's plans are to surround the area or turn it into a fire,\" Haidai said in a statement on Telegram on Saturday, adding that Ukrainian forces had defended the city against 11 enemy incursions.\n\nA Russian breakthrough in Luhansk would enable an attack on Donetsk and Kharkiv provinces, he added.\n\n\"This is the difficult fate of Luhansk region, not to allow the Russians to move forward,\" he said. Later Saturday, Haidai said the Russians had destroyed a bridge between Severodonetsk and its twin city Lysychansk across the Seversky Donets River, which will make reinforcing the area more difficult.\n\nThe grinding advance in the east comes one day after Russia claimed its biggest victory in its almost-three-month assault: the full capture of the Azovstal steelworks plant, the labyrinthine underground network of tunnels that became Ukraine's last stand in the coastal Sea of Azov city of Mariupol, along with the surrender of what the Russian Defense Ministry said were 2,439 Ukrainian fighters.\n\nAlthough Kyiv said it would bring back its troops via prisoner exchanges, the Kremlin has yet to comment on their fate. In recent days, Russian lawmakers in the Duma called for prison terms and even capital punishment for members of the Azov regiment, a far-right Ukrainian military unit with neo-Nazi roots whose fighters emerged as the Azovstal plant's most stubborn defenders. The history of the group has been seized on by the Kremlin to falsely claim it is fighting \"Nazis\" in Ukraine.\n\nMariupol has been a target of Russia's invasion virtually from the start of the war. As the rest of the city fell into Russian hands, a ragtag assortment of Ukrainian troops and civilians bunkered in the steelworks even as their adversaries maintained a relentless siege -- not to mention continuous bombardment -- on the plant. Women, children and elderly people were first bused out before Ukrainian authorities ordered the remaining troops to surrender. The full death toll of civilians in the Mariupol siege is still unknown, but Ukraine says it could be many thousands.\n\nEarlier, Denis Pushilin, self-proclaimed leader of the separatist Donetsk People's Republic, said the Azovstal plant would be demolished and replaced with a park, a residence or what he called a techno park.\n\nAt a cemetery in Bucha -- the suburb of Kyiv now infamous for alleged Russian war crimes -- families took time on Saturday to visit the graves of relatives and friends lost in the war. Many mourners at the cemetery described what they viewed as the heroism of the Ukrainian defenders of Mariupol, who held off a superior Russian force for weeks.\n\n\"They are our heroes, they fought to the end,\" said Anton Adoniev, 26, who visited the grave of a soldier from Bucha who recently was killed in the Donbas. \"We all have faith that Ukraine will triumph in the end.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in remarks released Saturday, again insisted his country will ultimately prevail in the grueling conflict but that it will be a \"bloody\" victory.\n\n\"I do not believe that we were badly prepared for the war,\" he said. \"We should look at the price of this war. We are going to reclaim everything in any case. We have broken the backbone of one of the strongest armies in the world.\"\n\nBut, he acknowledged: \"The war is so complicated and so will be the victory. It will be bloody, through fighting, but the end will definitely be via diplomacy.\"\n\nAt the same time, he said prospects for talks with Russia right now were dim.\n\nZelensky made the taped comments in a rare joint appearance with his wife, Olena Zelenska, whose only other public appearance in the war so far was with Jill Biden in a surprise stop by the U.S. first lady in western Ukraine on Mother's Day.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian state gas company Gazprom confirmed on Saturday a complete halt in gas supplies as of 7 a.m. Moscow time to Gasum, Finland's state-owned natural gas wholesaler, after Helsinki refused to pay in rubles.\n\n\"Payments for gas supplied from April 1 must be made in rubles ... which the counterparties were informed of in a timely manner,\" Gazprom said, according to a report from Russian state news operator Tass.\n\nThe cutoff comes days after Finland and Sweden reversed a decades-old policy of neutrality and sought to join NATO.\n\n\"It is highly regrettable that natural gas supplies under our supply contract will now be halted,\" Gasum Chief Executive Mika Wiljanen said in a statement.\n\n\"However, we have been carefully preparing for this situation and provided that there will be no disruptions in the gas transmission network, we will be able to supply all our customers with gas in the coming months.\"\n\nThe NATO applications of Finland and Sweden have received enthusiastic support from the United States and most members of the transatlantic alliance -- with the notable exception of Turkey. Ankara's opposition threatens to block the membership of the Nordic countries. Turkey accuses the nations of lending support to Kurdish separatists whom it regards as terrorists.\n\nThe leaders of Finland and Sweden held separate telephone conversations with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday in attempts to assure him they will be respectful of Ankara's security concerns.\n\n\"Close dialogue continues,\" Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said afterward on Twitter.\n\nIn another sign of the war's increasing fallout beyond Ukraine's borders, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the small country of Moldova southwest of Ukraine should be equipped \"to NATO standard\" militarily so as to repulse any Russian aggression.\n\nSpeaking to the Telegraph newspaper Saturday, Truss said Ukraine should be \"permanently able to defend itself\" along with \"vulnerable states\" such as Moldova.\n\n\"I would want to see Moldova equipped to NATO standard,\" she said. \"This is a discussion we're having with our allies.\"\n\nShe added that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"has been clear about his ambitions to create a greater Russia,\" which would presumably include parts of Moldova, which like Ukraine is a former Soviet republic.\n\n\"And just because his attempts to take Kyiv weren't successful doesn't mean he's abandoned those ambitions.\"\n\nElsewhere, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said his forces destroyed an arms shipment sent by the U.S. and Europe to Ukraine's military in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region.\n\n\"High-precision, long-range, sea-based Kalibr missiles in the area of the Malyn railway station in the Zhytomyr region destroyed a large batch of weapons and military equipment delivered from the United States and European countries,\" Konashenkov said in a statement Saturday.\n\nMalyn is about 60 miles northwest of Kyiv. Konashenkov said the weapons and materiel were to go to Ukrainian troops in the Donbas.\n\nThe Pentagon says Russian forces have repeatedly attempted to intercept shipments from the U.S. and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, which generally enter Ukraine over land from its western flank. Until now, the Pentagon has said the Russian attempts were unsuccessful.

Luhansk is part of the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking eastern expanse of coal mines and factories that Russian President Vladimir Putin is bent on capturing.\n\n\"The liberation of the Luhansk People's Republic is nearing completion,\" Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu declared, referring to the breakaway state proclaimed by pro-Moscow separatists in 2014 and recognized by the Kremlin.\n\nIn Mariupol, the strategic port in the southern corner of the Donbas, Russian troops worn down by their nearly three-month siege of the city may not get the time they need to regroup, Britain's Defense Ministry said.\n\nWith the battle winding down for the Azovstal steel plant that represented the last bastion of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol, Russia is continuing to pull back forces there, and their commanders are under pressure to quickly send them elsewhere in the Donbas, according to the British.\n\n\"That means that Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition,\" the ministry said.\n\nAn undisclosed number of Ukrainian soldiers remained at the Azovstal steel plant. Russia said more than 1,900 had surrendered in recent days. Also remaining at the plant were the bodies of soldiers who defended it while tying down Russian forces.\n\nDenis Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, which led the defense of the plant, called them \"fallen heroes.\"\n\n\"I hope soon relatives and the whole of Ukraine will be able to bury the fighters with honors,\" he said.\n\nWives of fighters who held out at the steelworks spoke emotionally about what may have been their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\nMeanwhile, fighting intensified deeper in the Donbas.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces were especially focused on the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway, the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The road is extremely important because it's the only connection to other regions of the country,\" he said via email. \"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region.\"\n\nRussian forces shelled the road constantly from multiple directions, but Ukrainian armored transports were still able to get through, Haidai added.\n\nMoscow's troops have been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas. One of Friday's attacks was on a school in Severodonetsk that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, Haidai said. Three adults were killed, he said on Telegram.\n\nTwelve people were killed in Severodonetsk, Haidai said. It was not immediately clear if that included the three at the school. In addition, more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nRussian forces now control 90 percent of Luhansk, but the attack on Severodonetsk failed -- \"the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated,\" Haidai said. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nPro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas for the past eight years and held a considerable swath of it before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. But the effort by Putin's troops to take more territory there has been slow-going.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, Britain's Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian forces elsewhere in Ukraine continued to blast away at targets, some of them civilian.\n\nIn the village of Velyka Kostromka, west of the Donbas, explosions in the middle of the night Thursday shook Iryna Martsyniuk's house to its foundations. Roof timbers splintered and windows shattered, sending shards of glass into a wall near three sleeping children.\n\n\"There were flashes everywhere,\" she said. \"There was smoke everywhere.\" She grabbed the children and ran toward the home's entrance, \"but the corridor wasn't there anymore. Instead, we saw the starry night.\"\n\nThey ran down the road to a neighbor's home, where they hid in the basement.\n\nAround 20 other houses were damaged and two people were lightly injured, said Olha Shaytanova, head of the village.\n\n___\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

A local health official had earlier put the number of wounded at seven.\n\nZelenskiy released a video on social media showing a large explosion hitting the newly renovated Palace of Culture in Lozova. The building was partly destroyed, and the roof caught fire, Ukraine's emergency services reported.\n\n\"The occupiers identified culture, education, and humanity as their enemies,\" Zelenskiy said. \"What is in the minds of people who choose such targets? Absolute evil, absolute stupidity.\"\n\nSinegubov said there was no doubt the Russian forces targeted the cultural center, adding on Telegram that two of three missiles fired had been intercepted and the blaze that broke out at the center had been extinguished.\n\nBritish intelligence on May 20 noted in its daily report on the situation in Ukraine that after securing the strategic Sea of Azov port following a monthslong siege that turned the city into ruins and killed thousands of civilians, Moscow is likely to redeploy troops to aid in the offensive in the east.\n\nThose soldiers who left Azovstal, including those who were wounded, were reportedly transferred to territory in eastern Ukraine that is controlled by Kremlin-backed separatists.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has said it is registering the hundreds of Ukrainian fighters who left the Azovstal plant in Mariupol as prisoners of war (POWs).\n\nThe ICRC says the registration of the fighters as POWs was \"critical to ensure they're accounted for & treated humanely and with dignity\" and allows the organization to track those who have been captured and help them keep in touch with their families.\n\nKyiv has expressed hope that the fighters will be exchanged for Russian prisoners, but separatist authorities in the eastern Donetsk region suggested some of them could be put on trial.\n\nIn southeastern Ukraine, an estimated 1,000 vehicles carrying Ukrainian civilians were prevented from crossing into Ukrainian-held territory in Zaporizhzhya. The regional military administration said on May 20 that cars full of people trying to evacuate were stuck at a Russian checkpoint in the city of Vasylivka.\n\n\"In Vasylivka, the occupiers have not allowed more than 1,000 cars to enter the territory controlled by Ukraine for the fourth day in a row,\" the administration said in a Telegram post, adding that there are women and children in the cars, and that most of them no longer have money for food and water.\n\nIn Luhansk, local authorities said on May 20 that indiscriminate Russian bombardment had killed at least 13 civilians over the past 24 hours and caused substantial damage.\n\nTwelve people were killed in the town of Severodonesk, where a Russian assault has been unsuccessful, said the regional governor, Serhiy Hayday. The town and the city of Lysychansk are in an area where Russian troops have launched an offensive.\n\nIn Donetsk, \"the Russian enemy carried out massive artillery shelling of civilian infrastructure, including multiple-rocket launchers,\" Ukraine's General Staff said in a statement.\n\nUkraine's Prosecutor-General's Office said that as of May 20, 232 children had been killed and 427 wounded since the beginning of the Russian invasion.\n\nIn a regular address to the nation, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia had \"completely destroyed\" Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.\n\n\"It is hell there -- and that is not an exaggeration,\" Zelenskiy said in his nightly address, repeating his accusation that Russia is committing genocide, a claim Moscow has denied.\n\nZelenskiy also said that in the Chernihiv region north of Kyiv, the village of Desna was hit with Russian missiles on May 19 and that many were killed. Desna is some 70 kilometers from the border with Belarus.\n\nZelenskiy spoke on May 19 with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about a range of issues, including financial aid to assist the shattered Ukrainian economy, agricultural exports, and \"the evacuation of our heroes from Azovstal.\"\n\nShoigu said on May 20 that the \"liberation of the Luhansk People's Republic\" -- a territory in Ukraine recognized by Russia as independent and controlled by Moscow-backed separatists -- would be completed soon.\n\nThe minister also said Russia would beef up its western defenses with troops and 12 additional military bases in response to Sweden and Finland's bid to join NATO.\n\nThe two Nordic countries shed their longtime neutrality this week by formally submitting applications to join the alliance, saying the move was necessary because of security concerns sparked by Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa, BBC, CNN, and TASS\n\nSource: https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-ukraine- luhansk-mariupol-zelenskiy-pows/31859396.html\n\nCopyright (c) 2022.

They completely ruined Rubizhne, Vonokvakha, just as Mariupol,\" President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly video address late Friday, adding the Russians were \"trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities\".\n\nIn the eastern city of Severodonetsk, 12 people were killed and another 40 wounded by Russian shelling, the regional governor said.\n\n- 'End of the operation' -Zelensky described the bombardment of Severodonetsk as \"brutal and absolutely pointless\", as residents cowering in basements described an unending ordeal of terror.\n\nThe city forms part of the last pocket of Ukrainian resistance in Lugansk, which along with the neighbouring region of Donetsk comprises the Donbas war zone.\n\nMoscow on Friday said the battle for the Azovstal steelworks -- a symbol of Ukraine's dogged resistance since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion on February 24 -- was now over.\n\nRussian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenko said 2,439 Ukrainian personnel had surrendered at the steelworks since May 16, the final 500 on Friday.\n\nDefence Minister Sergei Shoigu had informed Putin of \"the end of the operation and the complete liberation of the (Azovstal) industrial complex and the city of Mariupol\", Konashenko added.\n\nUkraine hopes to exchange the surrendering Azovstal soldiers for Russian prisoners. But in Donetsk, pro-Kremlin authorities are threatening to put some of them on trial.\n\nIn Washington, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said all prisoners of war should \"be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention and the law of war\".\n\nPresident Joe Biden has cast the Ukraine war as part of a US-led struggle pitting democracy against authoritarianism.\n\nThe US Congress this week approved a $40-billion (38-billion-euro) aid package, including funds to enhance Ukraine's armoured vehicle fleet and air defence system.\n\nAnd meeting in Germany, G7 industrialised nations pledged $19.8 billion to shore up Ukraine's shattered public finances.\n\n- Finland's price -The war's economic repercussions continued to expand on Saturday, as Russia cut off its supply of natural gas to neighbouring Finland.\n\n\"Natural gas supplies to Finland under Gasum's supply contract have been cut off,\" Finnish state energy company Gasum said in a statement, adding that gas would instead be supplied from other sources via the Balticconnector pipeline, which connects Finland to Estonia.\n\nGasum a day earlier revealed the tap would be turned off when its contract with Russia's Gazprom ended at 7:00 am (0400 GMT) Saturday.\n\nThe move, which Russia has blamed on the Nordic country's refusal to pay in rubles, comes days after Finland and Sweden submitted a joint application for NATO membership.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly warned historically non-aligned Finland that applying for membership would be \"a grave mistake with far-reaching consequences.\"\n\nBoth Finland and Sweden are seemingly on the fast track to joining the defence alliance, with Biden offering \"full, total, complete backing\" to their bids.\n\nBut all 30 existing NATO members must agree on any new entrants, and Turkey has condemned the Nordic neighbours' alleged toleration of Kurdish militants.\n\nShoigu has said the Kremlin would respond to any NATO expansion by creating more military bases in western Russia.\n\nSaturday's halt to gas shipments follows Moscow cutting off Poland and Bulgaria last month in a move the EU described as \"blackmail\".\n\n- Underground living -While the invasion that sparked the potential NATO expansion has ebbed around the northeastern city of Kharkiv, it remains in Russian artillery range, and hundreds of people are refusing to leave the relative safety of its metro system.\n\n\"We're tired.

I am very convinced of this,\" Zelenskyy said in a Ukrainian television interview late Friday. \"There are things that we can't bring to an end without sitting at the negotiation table.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian leader also said his country is attempting to recover fighters who surrendered to Russian forces after weeks of fighting at the Azovstal steel plant in the southern port city of Mariupol.\n\n\"Everything will depend on (the responsibilities) the U.N., the Red Cross and the Russian Federation took on themselves, that they (the fighters) all will be in safety, waiting for one or the other exchange format,\" he said. He said Ukraine's intelligence service is making preparations \"for a dialogue and an exchange.\"\n\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly three months ago, on Feb. 24.\n\nConcern for the treatment of those fighters increased Saturday when Denis Pushilin, the pro-Kremlin head of an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, said they would face tribunals.\n\nPushilin said there were 2,439 people in custody, including some foreign nationals among the fighters.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Saturday that Ukraine would fight for the return of every soldier.\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine that Mariupol was fully under Russian control.\n\nThe port city is the scene of the war's bloodiest siege, with Russian forces bombarding it for nearly three months. Much of Mariupol has been reduced to rubble, and more than 20,000 civilians are feared dead.\n\nBut its capture adds to Moscow's goal of a land route from Russia to the Crimea and perhaps beyond.\n\nRussia destroyed a Ukrainian special operations base near Odesa, Ukraine's main Black Sea port on Saturday, as well as a significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region, The Associated Press reported, quoting Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nThe end of the fighting in Mariupol not only gives Russian President Vladimir Putin a victory, but it allows him to shift fighters east to the Donbas.\n\nAmong the developments there:\n\nThe only functioning hospital in Sievierodonetsk, the main city under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk region, has three doctors left and enough supplies for 10 days, Gov. Serhii Haidai said.\n\nHaidai also said Russian troops destroyed a bridge on the Siverskiy Donets River between Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk.

In a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, the UK Ministry of Defence said.\n\nRussian forces attacked the cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk, both in the Luhansk region of the Donbas, the region's governor said on Friday.\n\nTwelve people were killed, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, said Serhiy Haidai in a Telegram post.\n\nBut the attack on Severodonetsk was unsuccessful. Both Mr Haidai and Ukraine's General Staff of the military said Russia took losses and retreated.\n\nStill, Russia's struggles in the east only seemed to translate into an intensifying offensive that is inflicting increasing suffering.\n\n\"It is hell there, and that's not an exaggeration,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of the campaign.\n\n\"The brutal and completely senseless bombardment of Severodonetsk. Twelve dead and dozens wounded there in just one day,\" he said in his nightly video address to the nation.\n\nMeanwhile, in the first war crimes trial held by Ukraine, Sgt Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old member of a Russian tank unit, told a court in Kyiv on Thursday that he shot Oleksandr Shelipov, a 62-year-old Ukrainian civilian, in the head on orders from an officer.\n\nShishimarin apologised to the victim's widow, Kateryna Shelipova, who described seeing her husband being shot just outside their home in the early days of Russia's invasion.\n\nShe told the court that she believes Shishimarin deserves a life sentence, the maximum possible, but that she would not mind if he were exchanged as part of a swap for the Azovstal defenders.\n\nUkraine's surprisingly stiff resistance has been bolstered by western arms and funding - and more help was on the way this week.\n\nThe G7 has agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's public finances, bringing the total aid to $19.8 billion (\u20ac18.75 billion), Germany's finance minister said. The goal is to ensure that Ukraine's financial situation does not affect its ability to defend itself from Russia's invasion.\n\nAlso, more US aid appeared to be on its way to Ukraine when the Senate overwhelmingly approved a $40 billion package of military and economic aid for the country and its allies. The house of representatives voted for it last week, and US president Joe Biden's quick signature is certain.\n\n\"Help is on the way, really significant help.

Border guards, police officers, and territorial defense squads formed shortly before the war supplemented their ranks.\n\nThe bulk of these forces were deployed to defend Mariupol, home to a stategically located port, at the start of the Russian invasion. Marines from the 36th brigade held the port and another large plant in Mariupol for more than a month, until they ran out of supplies and ammunition.\n\nThey moved to the Azovstal steel mill to join the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right, and some of them were captured by the Russians.\n\nWHY DOES RUSSIA LABEL THEM 'NATIONALISTS'?\n\nIn announcing Azovstal's seizure, the Russian Defense Ministry's chief spokesman referred to the Azov Regiment's fighters as Nazis and said their commander was taken away in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred of him \"for numerous atrocities.\"\n\nNo evidence has surfaced of the regiment mistreating Ukrainian civilians, hundreds of whom sheltered underground with the fighters. The regiment released several videos taken inside Azovstal that showed their members interacting with the civilians and giving children sweets.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly made negative assertions about the Azov Regiment.\n\nThe National Guard unit grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that rose to bolster Ukraine's underfunded and questionably led military in the fight against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThat conflict broke out after massive protests drove Ukraine's Kremlin-leaning president from office.\n\nThe Azov Battalion drew its initial fighters from far-right circles and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. Its current members rejected accusations of nationalism and radicalism. Sviatoslav Palamar, the regiment's deputy commander, said in a recent interview from the steel mill that he preferred the term \"patriotism.\"\n\nWHAT DID THE DEFENDERS ACCOMPLISH?\n\nAs Mariupol became a symbol of the suffering and resistance of Ukrainians after Russia invaded their country, Ukrainian officials repeatedly stressed the role the fighters at Azovstal played in defending the city and stymying Russian progress elsewhere.\n\n\"The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol have already performed a feat, drawing the elite forces of the Russian army onto themselves and significantly slowing down the advance of the Russians in the southeast,\" Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said.\n\nAfter the plant's defenders were instructed to end their fight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the move was proper and humane because \"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle.\"\n\nThe ruined seaside city and the outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian fighters whose persistence frustrated Russia's objective to capture Mariupol quickly are now irrevocably etched into Ukrainian history, regardless of the outcome of the war.\n\nThe defense of Mariupol \"will go down in history as Thermopylae of the 21st century,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's president, said as the fighters started leaving the plant. \"The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy's plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war.\"\n\nThermopylae is widely considered one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing. They were killed to a man, including their king.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Luhansk is part of the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking eastern expanse of coal mines and factories that Russian President Vladimir Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Russia said more than 1,900 had surrendered in recent days. Also remaining at the plant were the bodies of soldiers who defended it while tying down Russian forces.\n\nDenis Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, which led the defense of the plant, called them \"fallen heroes.\"\n\n\"I hope soon relatives and the whole of Ukraine will be able to bury the fighters with honors,\" he said.\n\nWives of fighters who held out at the steelworks spoke emotionally about what may have been their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\nMeanwhile, fighting intensified deeper in the Donbas.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces were especially focused on the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway, the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The road is extremely important because it's the only connection to other regions of the country,\" he said via email. \"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region.\"\n\nRussian forces shelled the road constantly from multiple directions, but Ukrainian armored transports were still able to get through, Haidai added.\n\nMoscow's troops have been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas. One of Friday's attacks was on a school in Severodonetsk that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, Haidai said. Three adults were killed, he said on Telegram.\n\nTwelve people were killed in Severodonetsk, Haidai said. It was not immediately clear if that included the three at the school. In addition, more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nRussian forces now control 90 percent of Luhansk, but the attack on Severodonetsk failed -- \"the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated,\" Haidai said. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nPro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas for the past eight years and held a considerable swath of it before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. But the effort by Putin's troops to take more territory there has been slow-going.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, Britain's Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian forces elsewhere in Ukraine continued to blast away at targets, some of them civilian.\n\nIn the village of Velyka Kostromka, west of the Donbas, explosions in the middle of the night Thursday shook Iryna Martsyniuk's house to its foundations. Roof timbers splintered and windows shattered, sending shards of glass into a wall near three sleeping children.\n\n\"There were flashes everywhere,\" she said. \"There was smoke everywhere.\" She grabbed the children and ran toward the home's entrance, \"but the corridor wasn't there anymore. Instead, we saw the starry night.\"\n\nThey ran down the road to a neighbor's home, where they hid in the basement.\n\nAround 20 other houses were damaged and two people were lightly wounded, said Olha Shaytanova, head of the village.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

That ended the most destructive siege of the war.\n\n\"The territory of the Azovstal metallurgical plant ... has been completely liberated,\" the ministry said in a statement, adding that 2,439 defenders had surrendered in the past few days, including 531 in the final group.\n\nHours earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the last defenders at the steelworks had been told by Ukraine's military that they could get out and save their lives.

She believed he was still alive.\n\n\"The situation is really hard and horrible and my husband is on the way from one hell to another hell, from Azovstal steel plant to a prison, to captivity,\" Zarytska said in Istanbul, where she and other relatives lobbied Turkey to help save the fighters.\n\nThe Red Cross said it had registered hundreds of Ukrainians who surrendered at the plant as prisoners of war and Kyiv says it wants a prisoner swap.

In addition, Germany's finance minister said Friday that the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations would allocate $19.8 billion in aid as part of what the G-7 declared was its commitment \"to our united response to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and to our unwavering support to Ukraine.\"\n\nWestern military and humanitarian assistance have been crucial to Ukraine's ability to defy an enemy whose military might, both in personnel and weaponry, dwarfs its own.\n\n\"This is a demonstration of strong leadership and a necessary contribution to our common defense of freedom,\" Zelenskyy said of the new U.S. pledge.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Friday accused Western countries of mounting a \"serious,\" though ultimately unsuccessful, campaign of cyberattacks against his country.\n\n\"A true aggression has been initiated against Russia, a war in informational space,\" Putin said to members of Russia's Security Council, according to Russian state news agency Tass. \"That cyberaggression against us, as well as the overall sanctions attack on Russia, has failed.\"\n\nThe Kremlin has warned of reprisals against countries rallying behind Ukraine. On Friday, Finland's state-owned natural gas wholesaler, Gasum, said Russia's state energy company, Gazprom, had announced that it would halt supplies to the Finnish company starting Saturday.\n\nThe cutoff comes just a few days after Helsinki submitted its application to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a move that ends decades of official military nonalignment and incenses Moscow. Last month, Gazprom also shut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria over their refusal to pay for the gas in rubles, which would help prop up the beleaguered Russian currency, instead of in the dollars or euros specified under contract.\n\nGasum Chief Executive Mika Wiljanen told customers that the company had \"been carefully preparing for this situation\" and should be able to keep the pipelines running.\n\nWith the conquest of Mariupol, Moscow now controls access to the Sea of Azov.\n\nThat has had disastrous effects on Ukraine's economy, particularly its ability to export the grain that millions of people around the world depend on for food. Officials said the loss in trade and the costs of war have contributed to a budget deficit of $5 billion. And reduced exports and rising prices for wheat have worsened food insecurity in Egypt, Pakistan and elsewhere.\n\nAt a United Nations Security Council meeting Thursday to address the crisis, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said the food supply for millions of people worldwide was being \"held hostage by the Russian military\" -- an accusation that Russian officials dismissed as a lie. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was trying to negotiate a plan to move Ukrainian food exports out through the Black Sea.\n\nValeriy Zaluzhny, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, told journalists that his troops have so far managed to keep the key Black Sea port of Mykolaiv, west of Crimea, under Ukrainian control.\n\nUkrainian forces are also pushing southeast toward Kherson, the first city to fall after the war began Feb. 24, amid growing signs that Russia is planning to annex parts of the region, including the city of Melitopol, where the occupiers are reportedly introducing the use of the ruble in place of the Ukrainian hryvnia.\n\nFears remain high for the Ukrainian soldiers captured in Mariupol who Moscow now says number more than 2,000. Ukrainian officials have declined to give a precise figure. Transferred to a penal camp in Russian-controlled territory, many are severely injured and face deep hostility from Russian soldiers and politicians, who have branded the Azov regiment as \"Nazis\" deserving trial and punishment.\n\nThe International Red Cross says it has registered as prisoners of war hundreds of troops evacuated from the massive steel plant.\n\nEarlier this week, the government in Kyiv said it was giving up the fight for the devastated city, but a band of diehard soldiers remained holed up in the plant.\n\nCompleting its takeover of Mariupol allows Russia to continue moving troops to the Donbas, now the focus of its offensive after its failure to capture Kyiv or the northeastern city of Kharkiv. But having been tied up so long in Mariupol and suffered losses, the forces there \"must be re-equipped and refurbished before they can be redeployed effectively,\" which can be a lengthy process, Britain's Ministry of Defense said in its daily assessment of the war.\n\nThe Russian military has fallen well short of Putin's goals for his so-called special military operation in Ukraine. To try to notch more successes quickly, \"Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition,\" the British assessment said.\n\nThe British government reported earlier that a number of senior commanders had already been relieved of their posts, including Lt. Gen. Serhiy Kisel, whose fighters were unable to subdue Kharkiv. Vice Adm. Igor Osipov, the head of Russia's Black Sea fleet, has also likely been suspended following the sinking of the flagship cruiser Moskva last month, a stunning victory for Ukraine that was aided by U.S.-provided intelligence.\n\n\"A culture of cover-ups and scapegoating is probably prevalent within the Russian military and security system,\" the British Ministry of Defense said. \"Many officials involved in the invasion of Ukraine will likely be increasingly distracted by efforts to avoid personal culpability for Russia's operational setbacks.\"\n\n------\n\n(McDonnell reported from Kyiv and Chu from London.

The bombing and shelling of other cities, the air and missile strikes of the Russian army -- all this is not just hostilities during the war.\"\n\nZelensky's comments come as the United Nations and the European Union investigate areas in Ukraine once occupied by Russian troops for evidence of war crimes. This week, one 21-year-old Russia soldier entered a guilty plea for killing an unarmed civilian.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu pushed back on Zelensky's assertion Friday, pointing to its efforts to clear civilians from Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant it has attacked for months. Shoigu said 177 civilians had been evacuated from the plant last week.\n\n\"I vouch that the Russian armed forces are doing everything to prevent deaths among the civilian population,\" Shoigu said, according to CNN. \"Since the beginning of the special military operation, more than 1.37 million people have been evacuated from the dangerous regions of the people's republic, as well as from Ukraine to Russia.\"\n\nThe Russian defense ministry said Friday it has taken into custody nearly 2,000 Ukrainian fighters from the steel plant and its troops continued to take control of the sprawling facility.\n\nThe massive factory was the last stronghold of Ukrainian soldiers in the city destroyed by Russia over nearly three months of fighting.

It said an unknown number of Ukrainian fighters remain in the plant.\n\n\"Staunch Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol since the start of the war means Russian forces in the area must be re-equipped and refurbished before they can be redeployed effectively,\" the British Ministry of Defense said on Twitter. \"This can be a lengthy process when done thoroughly.\"\n\nOn the battlefield, Russia continued to ratchet up attacks in pine forests and rolling hills around the eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk on Friday.

Border guards, police officers, and territorial defense squads formed shortly before the war supplemented their ranks.\n\nThe bulk of these forces were deployed to defend Mariupol, home to a stategically located port, at the start of the Russian invasion. Marines from the 36th brigade held the port and another large plant in Mariupol for more than a month, until they ran out of supplies and ammunition.\n\nThey moved to the Azovstal steel mill to join the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right, and some of them were captured by the Russians.\n\nWHY DOES RUSSIA LABEL THEM 'NATIONALISTS'?\n\nIn announcing Azovstal's seizure, the Russian Defense Ministry's chief spokesman referred to the Azov Regiment's fighters as Nazis and said their commander was taken away in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred of him \"for numerous atrocities.\"\n\nNo evidence has surfaced of the regiment mistreating Ukrainian civilians, hundreds of whom sheltered underground with the fighters.

It is hell there - and that is not an exaggeration,\" Zelensky said in a late Thursday (May 19) address.\n\n\"(There are) constant strikes on the Odesa region, on the cities of central Ukraine. The Donbas is completely destroyed,\" he said.\n\nMoscow calls its invasion a \"special military operation\" to rid Ukraine of fascists, an assertion Kyiv and its Western allies say is a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war.\n\nRussia has intensified its offensive and assault operations in Donetsk, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said.\n\nFive civilians were killed in Donetsk on Thursday, according to regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko. \"The enemy is destroying all civil infrastructure even in places relatively far from the front line,\" he told local television.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify the information. Moscow denies targeting civilians.\n\nThe past week has seen Russia secure its biggest victory since the invasion began, with Kyiv announcing it had ordered its garrison in a steelworks in Mariupol to stand down, after a protracted siege of the city.\n\nRussian forces have, however, been pushed back this month from the outskirts of the second-largest city Kharkiv.\n\nUkraine says it has recaptured 23 settlements near Kharkiv in the last two weeks.\n\nAs the invasion nears the three-month mark, the Group of Seven rich nations agreed to provide Ukraine with US$18.4 billion (S$25.4 billion) to pay its bills. Ukraine said the money would speed up victory over Russia and was just as important as \"the weapons you provide\".\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters: \"The message was, 'We stand behind Ukraine. We're going to pull together with the resources that they need to get through this.'\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal had written on Twitter, \"Support of partners will speed up our victory...Despite Russia's efforts to destroy our economy, together we will win!\"\n\nThe United States also said it had authorised US$100 million in additional arms, equipment, and supplies for Ukraine. The White House is working to put advanced anti-ship missiles in the hands of Ukrainian fighters to help defeat Russia's naval blockade, officials said.\n\nAnd in a further sign of Western action hurting the Russian economy, five foreign vice-presidents of Russia's Rosneft have resigned because of EU sanctions forbidding European citizens or Russians living in the EU to work at the oil company, sources said.\n\nThe EU said it is looking into ways of using the frozen assets of Russian oligarchs to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, while the United States has not ruled out possibly placing sanctions on countries that purchase Russian oil.\n\nBut Western divisions have also been on show with Nato member Turkey opposed to Sweden and Finland joining the alliance, a move that would reverse generations of military non-alignment in the biggest European security shake-up in decades.\n\nAnkara accuses the two Nordic states of harbouring Kurdish militants, but US President Joe Biden and European leaders said they were confident Turkey's concerns could be addressed.\n\nBiden, hosting Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson and Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 at the White House, told reporters: \"I think we're going to be OK.\"\n\nNiinisto said Finland would commit to Turkey's security, adding, \"We condemn terrorism in all its forms and we are actively engaged in combating it.\"\n\nIn Mariupol, the ultimate outcome of the bloodiest battle in Europe for decades has remained unclear, with uncertainty over the fate of hundreds of Ukrainian defenders.\n\nMoscow said on Thursday that 1,730 Ukrainian fighters had surrendered so far, including 771 in the past 24 hours.\n\nUkrainian officials, who have sought a prisoner swap, had declined to comment, saying it could endanger rescue efforts.\n\nLate on Thursday, Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy head of the Azov Regiment defending the steelworks, released an 18-second video in which he said he and other commanders were still on the territory of the plant.\n\n\"A certain operation is going on, the details of which I will not disclose,\" he said.\n\nThe Switzerland-based International Committee of the Red Cross said it has registered hundreds of prisoners from the plant now held by Russia, but it has not given a precise number.\n\nThe leader of Russian-backed separatists in control of the area said nearly half of the fighters remained inside the steelworks, where underground bunkers and tunnels had protected them from weeks of Russian bombardment.\n\n\"More than half have laid down their arms,\" Denis Pushilin told the Solovyov Live Internet television channel.\n\nThe wounded were given medical treatment while those who were fit were taken to a penal colony and were being treated well, he said.\n\nRussia denies it agreed to a prisoner swap.

In a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, the UK Ministry of Defence said.\n\nRussian forces attacked the cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk, both in the Luhansk region of the Donbas, the region's governor said on Friday.\n\nTwelve people were killed, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, said Serhiy Haidai in a Telegram post.\n\nStill, Russia's struggles in the east only seemed to translate into an intensifying offensive that is inflicting increasing suffering.\n\n\"It is hell there, and that's not an exaggeration,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of the campaign.\n\n\"The brutal and completely senseless bombardment of Severodonetsk. Twelve dead and dozens wounded there in just one day,\" he said in his nightly video address to the nation.\n\nMeanwhile, in the first war crimes trial held by Ukraine, Sgt Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old member of a Russian tank unit, told a court in Kyiv on Thursday that he shot Oleksandr Shelipov, a 62-year-old Ukrainian civilian, in the head on orders from an officer.\n\nShishimarin apologised to the victim's widow, Kateryna Shelipova, who described seeing her husband being shot just outside their home in the early days of Russia's invasion.\n\nShe told the court that she believes Shishimarin deserves a life sentence, the maximum possible, but that she would not mind if he were exchanged as part of a swap for the Azovstal defenders.\n\nThe G7 has agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's public finances, bringing the total aid to 19.8 billion dollars (\u00a315.8 billion), Germany's finance minister said. The goal is to ensure that Ukraine's financial situation does not affect its ability to defend itself from Russia's invasion.\n\nAlso, more US aid appeared to be on its way to Ukraine when the Senate overwhelmingly approved a 40 billion dollar package of military and economic aid for the country and its allies. The house of representatives voted for it last week, and US President Joe Biden's quick signature is certain.\n\n\"Help is on the way, really significant help.

I believe that justice must be restored. There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency Tass quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly have tried to characterize the fighters who holed up in the Azovstal steel plant as neo-Nazis. Among the plant's more than 2,400 defenders were members of the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has not commented on Russia's claim of capturing Azovstal, which for weeks remained Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian resistance, and with it completing Moscow's long-sought goal of controlling the city, home to a strategic seaport.\n\nUkraine's military this week told the fighters holed up in the plant, hundreds of them wounded, that their mission was complete and they could come out. It described their extraction as an evacuation, not a mass surrender.\n\nThe impact of Russia's declared victory on the broader war in Ukraine remained unclear. Many Russian troops already had been redeployed from Mariupol to elsewhere in the conflict, which began with the Russian invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base in Black Sea region of Odesa as well as significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. There was no confirmation from the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn its morning operational report, the Ukrainian military general staff reported heavy fighting in much of eastern Ukraine, including the areas of Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\nSince failing to reach and capture Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Russia focused its offensive in the country's eastern industrial heartland. The Russia-backed separatists have controlled parts of the Donbas region since 2014, and Moscow wants to expand the territory under its control.\n\nMariupol, which is part of the Donbas, was blockkaded early in the war and became a frightening example to people elsewhere in the country of the hunger, terror and death they might face if the Russians surrounded their communities.\n\nAs the end drew near at the steel plant, wives of fighters who had held out told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, the wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she shared the words her husband wrote her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nThe wife of another fighter, Natalia Zaritskaya, said her husband reported earlier this week that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived and most were seriously wounded.\n\n\"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly,\" Zaritskaya said.\n\nThe seasize steelworks, occupying some 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been a battleground for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters held out with the help of air drops of supplies, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant and save themselves.\n\nRussia said the Azov Regiment's commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred for him.\n\nNo evidence of Ukrainian antipathy toward the nationalist regiment has emerged. The Kremlin has seized on the regiment's far-right origins in its drive to to cast the invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial.\n\nCapturing Mariupol furthers Russia's quest to essentially create a land bridge from Russia via much of the Donbas area bordering Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe city's seizure also helps Russian leader Putin offset some stinging setbacks, including the failure to take over Kyiv, the sinking of the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea and continued resistance that has stalled the offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nWith Mariupol under Russian control, Ukrainian authorities are likely to face delays in documenting evidence of alleged Russian atrocities in the city, including the bombings of a maternity hospital and a theater where civilians had taken cover.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAt one point in the siege, Pope Francis lamented that Mariupol had become a \"city of martyrs.\"\n\nAn estimated 100,000 of the 450,000 people who resided there before the war remain. Many, trapped by Russia's siege, were left without food, water and electricity.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the steel plant during humanitarian cease-fires. They spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nThe chief executive of Metinvest, a multinational company which owns the Azovstal plant and another steel mill, Ilyich, in Mariupol, spoke of the city's devastation in an interview published Saturday in Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to clean it (the city) up to hide their crimes,'' the newspaper quoted Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov as saying. \"The inhabitants are trying to make the city function, to make water supplies work again.\"\n\n\"But the sewer system is damaged, there has been flooding, and infections are feared\" from drinking the water, he said.\n\nThe Ilyich steelworks still has some intact infrastructure, but if the Russians try to get it running, Ukrainians will refuse to return to their jobs there, Ryzhenkov said.\n\n\"We will never work under Russian occupation,'' Ryzhenkov said.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said more than 1,900 surrendered in recent days. Also remaining at the plant were the bodies of soldiers who defended it while tying down Russian forces.\n\nDenis Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, which had led the defense of the plant, called them \"fallen heroes.\"\n\n\"I hope soon relatives and the whole of Ukraine will be able to bury the fighters with honors,\" he said.\n\nPro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas for the past eight years and held a considerable swath of it before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. But the effort by Russian President Vladimir Putin's troops to take more territory there has been slow-going.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, the British Defense Ministry said.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine continued to blast away at targets, some of them civilian.\n\nIn the village of Velyka Kostromka, west of the Donbas, explosions in the middle of the night Thursday shook Iryna Martsyniuk's house to its foundations. Roof timbers splintered and windows shattered, sending shards of glass into a wall near three sleeping children.\n\n\"There were flashes everywhere,\" she said. \"The windows smashed, there was smoke everywhere.\"\n\nShe grabbed the children and ran toward the home's entrance. \"But the corridor wasn't there anymore. Instead, we saw the starry night,\" she said.\n\nThe family finally was able to climb out of the wrecked house through a back window. They ran down the road to a neighbor's home, where they hid in the basement.\n\nAround 20 other houses were damaged and two people were lightly injured, said Olha Shaytanova, the head of the village.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Putin said his country has faced a tide of cyberattacks from the West but has managed to fend them off. He charged that \"an outright aggression has been unleashed against Russia, a war has been waged in the information space.\"\n\nOn Friday, a governor in the Donbas said Russian forces attacked the cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk. Twelve people were killed and more than 60 houses destroyed across the region, Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said in a Telegram post.\n\nBut the attack on Severodonetsk was unsuccessful, according to both Haidai and Ukraine's military, who said Russia took losses and retreated.

Others were said to be hospitalized.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The dispatcher is now on leave and faces termination.\n\nThe defense of the steel mill had been led by Ukraine's Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast its invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defense and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nIn other developments Friday, the West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine and fighting raged in the Donbas, the industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine that Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday the evacuation of his forces from the miles of tunnels and bunkers beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- Zelenskyy said Russia should be made to pay for every home, school, hospital and business it destroys. He called on Ukraine's partners to seize Russian funds and property under their jurisdiction and use them to create a fund to compensate those who suffered.\n\nRussia \"would feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every shell that it has fired at us,\" he said in his nightly video address.\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\n-- Russian lawmakers proposed a bill to lift the age limit of 40 for Russians volunteering for military service. Currently, all Russian men 18 to 27 must undergo a year of service, though many get college deferments and other exemptions.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported Friday in the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking expanse of coal mines and factories.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces shelled the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway from multiple directions, taking aim at the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region,\" he said via email.\n\nMoscow's troops have also been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas, and at least 12 people were killed there on Friday, Haidai said. A school that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, was hit, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nBut he said the Russians took losses in the attack on Severodonetsk and were forced to retreat. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

Those remaining inside the complex -- many injured, with little food or medical supplies -- indicated on Friday that they would soon lay down their arms.\n\nIn a live video on Telegram, Denys Prokopenko, a commander inside Azovstal, said only the dead remained.\n\nThe higher military command has given the order to save the lives of the soldiers of our garrison and to stop defending the city. I now hope that soon, the families and all of Ukraine will be able to bury their fighters with honours.\n\nHours earlier, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the Ukraine military had told the troops that could leave and save their lives.\n\nZelenskiy issued a similar statement weeks ago, but the defenders -- estimated at about 2,000, 60% of whom were injured -- held on as about 1,000 civilians sheltered underground. Russian forces finally allowed the evacuation of the civilians, almost all women and children, two weeks ago.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry announced, \"Underground structures of Azovstal...are now under full control of Russian armed forces.\" Pro-Kremlin social media channels posted a video of Sergei Volynsky, the commander of Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade, saying his unit has surrendered.\n\nAt the eastern end of a coastal corridor along the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, Mariupol was a central objective for the Kremlin and Russian forces. Occupation of the city, which held out against takeover by Russian proxies in 2014, may establish a land bridge between Russian proxy areas in eastern Ukraine and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south.\n\nHowever, Russia struggled to seize Mariupol despite overwhelming force. For 12 weeks, the operation tied down 12 battalion tactical groups -- out of an estimated 125 in the Russian invasion -- preventing them from being used elsewhere, including in Russia's current offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe Russians resorted to widespread shelling and bombing of civilian sites, levelling much of Mariupol. Mayor Vadym Boychenko said more than 21,000 people were killed, as the attackers dug mass graves outside Mariupol and blocked humanitarian aid and organized evacuations. Many civilians eventually left in private convoys, but up to 100,000 remain in the devastated city.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin was defeated in its initial objectives, including quick entry into the capital Kyiv and other cities, the downfall of the Zelenskiy Government, and the detention or killing of Ukrainian leaders. Russian forces only claimed two cities in Ukraine, Kherson and Melitopol in the southern coastal corridor, and failed to establish sieges of other cities and towns. They withdrew from northern Ukraine at the start of April, narrowing their focus to the assault on the Donbas in the east.\n\nSee also EA with Radio Renascen\u00e7a: Putin's Non-Victory Day in Ukraine...and Much, Much More\n\nShow Trials Coming?\n\nAs groups of Azovstal fighters surrendered, Russian officials and MPs indicated that they would be put on trial over \"war crimes\".

This follows the agreed upon surrender of Ukrainian forces who had been about to hold out in a cavernous network of tunnels under the facility for weeks amid increasingly dire circumstances.\n\nThe capture of Mariupol is an important gain for the Russian military and an equally significant loss for the Ukrainian armed forces. In addition to helping provide a secure overland route between western Russia and the occupied Crimean Peninsula, this is a tangible victory that Kremlin propagandists will be sure to repeatedly highlight going forward.\n\nAt the same time, with the question of Mariupol now settled, at least for the time being, the focus on both sides can fully shift to the front lines in eastern Ukraine, where Russian forces are still struggling to make any real progress. The U.K. Ministry of Defense issued a public assessment today that said Russian commanders could rush to redeploy forces from Mariupol elsewhere in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region without giving them sufficient time to regroup and resupply, which could limit the ability to effectively contribute to the ongoing offensive there.\n\nMaj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, Chief of the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine, said today that the country's long-term goal is to completely eject Russian and Russian-backed forces from the entirety of Ukraine.\n\nWARNING: Some of the updates below contain graphic material.\n\nThe War Zone readers can get themselves up to speed first on what has been happening recently in the conflict in Ukraine already through our previous rolling coverage here.\n\nPOSTED: 8:35 PM EST --\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu directly reported the \"complete liberation\" of Mariupol, including the Azovstal steelworks, to President Vladimir Putin earlier today, according to ministry spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov. A total of 2,439 Ukrainian personnel surrendered to Russian forces, including 500 just today, according to a ministry statement.\n\nAt the time of writing, there does not appear to be any confirmation of any of these details from the Ukrainian side. However, on Monday, officials in Ukraine had confirmed the existence of a Red Cross and United Nations-brokered deal to end the brutal siege of Azovstal, which had become the bastion for defenders in the city.\n\nRussian forces had been able to encircle the entire city of Mariupol within days of the start of the invasion in February and had subjected it to punishing air and artillery bombardments for weeks. At least 20,000 civilians are estimated to have died in the ensuing fighting.\n\n\"Staunch Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol since the start of the war means Russian forces in the area must be re-equipped and refurbished before they can be redeployed effectively. This can be a lengthy process when done thoroughly,\" according to an assessment that the U.K. Ministry of Defense released today. \"Russian commanders, however, are under pressure to demonstrably achieve operational objectives. This means that Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition.\"\n\nThe appearance of Russian 2S4 Tyulpan self-propelled 240mm mortars near Severodonetsk, a city in the Donbas region that has become a particular focus of the fighting there, may be one of the first examples of additional forces being brought in from Mariupol. These weapons, which can fire laser-guided projectiles and that you can read more about here, had been employed in the final weeks of fighting over the Avostal complex.\n\nRussian forces in Donbas are continuing to run up against significant Ukrainian resistance. The video below reportedly shows the aftermath of a recent Ukrainian attack on a supply convoy in the Luhansk region.\n\nThere have also been reports that Russia's military is looking to bolster its position in and around the southern city of Kherson, which has been another area in Ukraine where the country has looked to advance in recent weeks. There have also been reports that Russian forces are preventing civilians from evacuating from these areas, something they were also accused of doing repeatedly in and around Mariupol before international humanitarian organizations were able to intervene.\n\nPro-Russian actors in Kherson claim to have established an independent local government that will seek to integrate the region into the Russian Federation.\n\nRegardless, the U.S. military continues to assess that Russian forces remain well behind schedule in how they were expected to advance in areas of eastern and southern Ukraine in recent weeks. At the same time, the U.S. government, among others, continues to work to send more military aid to the Ukrainian armed forces to help them hold the line and even counterattack in some regions.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is set to virtually host another meeting the Ukraine Contact Group, which was formed last month with the express purpose of helping to facilitate additional aid for Ukraine, on Monday. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said today that the U.S. military's top military assistance focus is on delivering additional \"long-range fires\" capabilities, a broad category that artillery and surface-to-surface missiles, to Ukraine. There were reports this week that unspecified anti-ship missiles could be part of forthcoming American arms transfers.\n\nArmored vehicles are an increasingly common item in military aid packages for Ukraine. German authorities said today that it would begin delivering the first 15 Gepard armored self-propelled anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine in July. Officials in Germany are also reportedly facilitating the transfer of artillery pieces from the Czech Republic.\n\nRussian forces continue to launch missile strikes at various targets inside Ukraine. Russian missiles reportedly fell in the northern Kharkiv and southern Odesa regions today. Pictures and video from the Kharkiv strike suggested that the weapon in question may have been Kh-22 anti-ship cruise missile fired from a Tu-22M3 Backfire bomber and employed in a secondary land-attack role. Video footage had emerged online last week that showed what might have been another strike involving a TU-22M3-launched Kh-22.\n\nThe video below shows a Russian Mi-28N Havoc attack helicopter conducting operations somewhere in Ukraine armed with S-8 80mm and S-13 122mm unguided rockets. Separately, Alexander Mikheyev, head of Russia's state-run arms broker Rosoboronexport, highlighted how important helicopters have been to Russia's war in Ukraine today at the HeliRussia-2022 exhibition in Moscow. Interestingly, he said that Mi-171Sh helicopters, a type intended exclusively for export, were among those being employed regularly by Russian forces in Ukraine.\n\nNew video footage of Russia's BMPT Terminator armored vehicles, reportedly shot near the city of Popasna in the Donbas region, has emerged online.\n\nThe video below reportedly shows elements of Russian S-300PM-series surface-to-air missile systems on the move in Ukraine's Luhansk region, a significant portion of which is under the control of Russian-back separatists. It is worth noting that after months of fighting Russia's military has still not been able to achieve air superiority in the skies over Ukraine.\n\nWell-known YouTuber and Russian special operations forces veteran Alexander Arutyunov, who runs various social media channels under the handle RAZVEDOS, made a series of posts on Russia's Vkontakte social network, or VK, criticized the performance of various Russian small arms in Ukraine based on information he said he had received from still-active members of the Spetsnaz community. In particular, he said that various specialized rifles chambered in the 9x39mm cartridge had underperformed and been difficult to maintain. He further claimed that elite Russian personnel had sourced older 7.62x39mm AKMS rifles and PBS-1 sound suppressors because of issues in finding suppressors that are compatible with newer AK-12 rifles. Lastly, he offered reviews of various optics that Spetznaz personnel are using on multiple types of small arms.\n\nThere continue to be indications that the Russian military is in need of additional personnel to make up for losses sustained in Ukraine, but that authorities in Moscow would prefer to see alternatives to what could be a disruptive and unpopular general mobility of the country's armed forces. A member of Russia's parliament, or Duma, submitted a bill today that would, if signed into law, allow Russians over 40 and foreigners as old as 30 to enlist in the country's military.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin posthumously awarded Arsen Pavlov the country's Order of Courage today. Pavlov, also known by the nom de guerre \"Motorola,\" was a notorious separatist commander and self-described war criminal who led Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine until he was killed in a bombing of his apartment in 2016.\n\nRussia is maintaining a complete blockage of Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea, preventing shipments of grain from leaving the country. There are growing concerns that this will contribute to a global food crisis.\n\nFinland's national gas company Gasum has confirmed that Russia's Gazprom is set to cut off supplies to the country tomorrow. This is ostensibly over the Finnish government's refusal to meet Moscow's demand that foreign countries pay for Russian natural gas imports in rubles. However, it also follows Finland's announcement that it will seek membership in NATO, something that quickly drew rebukes from Russian officials.\n\nWe will continue to update this post with new information until we state otherwise.\n\nContact the author: joe@thedrive.com", "source": {"uri": "thedrive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Drive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_trevithick@thedrive.com", "name": "Joseph Trevithick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.thedrive.com/uploads/2022/05/21/russian-troops-mariupol-capture.jpg?auto=webp", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 50, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 65, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049930627", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "21:56:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T21:56:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T21:46:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5960784554481506, "url": "https://americanmilitarynews.com/2022/05/russia-cuts-off-gas-to-finland-amid-wider-push-into-ukraines-east/", "title": "Russia cuts off gas to Finland amid wider push into Ukraine's east", "body": "Russian troops pressed their offensive into the Donbas region on Saturday, aiming to encircle the easternmost point of Ukrainian control in what one official said would be a repeat of Moscow's assault on the beleaguered city of Mariupol.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow cut off natural gas exports to Finland, and the Russian defense ministry said it destroyed a consignment of U.S.- and European-supplied weapons meant for Ukrainian fighters in the Donbas.\n\nLuhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Saturday that Russian troops were throwing \"all their forces and efforts\" into assaulting Severodonetsk in Luhansk province, aiming to cut off the main supply route to the city. Six people were killed and three others wounded in Russian attacks on Severodonetsk, Hadai said, along with at least two others killed in shelling on neighboring towns.\n\n\"The Russians are destroying Severodonetsk, like Mariupol. The enemy's plans are to surround the area or turn it into a fire ... ,\" Haidai said in a statement on Telegram on Saturday, adding that Ukrainian forces had defended the city against 11 enemy incursions.\n\nA Russian breakthrough in Luhansk would enable an attack on Donetsk and Kharkiv provinces, he added.\n\n\"This is the difficult fate of Luhansk region, not to allow the Russians to move forward,\" he said. Later Saturday, Haidai said the Russians had destroyed a bridge between Severodonetsk and its twin city Lysychansk across the Siverskyi Donets River, which will make reinforcing the area more difficult.\n\nThe grinding advance in the east comes one day after Russia claimed its biggest victory in its almost-three-month assault: the full capture of the Azovstal steelworks plant, the labyrinthine underground network of tunnels that became Ukraine's last stand in the Black Sea coastal city of Mariupol, along with the surrender of what the Russian defense ministry said were 2,439 Ukrainian fighters.\n\nAlthough Kyiv said it would bring back its troops via prisoner exchanges, the Kremlin has yet to comment on their fate. In recent days, Russian lawmakers in the Duma called for prison terms and even capital punishment for members of the Azov Regiment, a far-right Ukrainian military unit with neo-Nazi roots whose fighters emerged as the Azovstal plant's most stubborn defenders. The history of the group has been seized on by the Kremlin to falsely claim it is fighting \"Nazis\" in Ukraine.\n\nMariupol has been a target of Russia's invasion virtually from the start of the war. As the rest of the city fell into Russian hands, a ragtag assortment of Ukrainian troops and civilians bunkered in the steelworks even as their adversaries maintained a relentless siege -- not to mention continuous bombardment -- on the plant. Women, children and elderly people were first bused out before Ukrainian authorities ordered the remaining troops to surrender. The full death toll of civilians in the Mariupol siege is still unknown, but Ukraine says it could be many thousands.\n\nEarlier, Denis Pushilin, self-proclaimed leader of the separatist Donetsk People's Republic, said the Azovstal plant would be demolished and replaced with either a park, a residence or what he called a techno park.\n\nAt a cemetery in Bucha -- the suburb of Kiev now infamous for alleged Russian war crimes -- many families took time on Saturday to visit the graves of relatives and friends lost in the war. Many mourners at the city cemetery described what they viewed as the heroism of the Ukrainian defenders of Mariupol, who held off a superior Russian force for weeks.\n\n\"They are our heroes, they fought to the end,\" said Anton Adoniev, 26, who visited the grave of a soldier from Bucha who recently was killed in the Donbas. \"We all have faith that Ukraine will triumph in the end.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Russian state gas company Gazprom confirmed on Saturday a complete halt in gas supplies as of 7 a.m. Moscow time to Gasum, Finland's state-owned natural gas wholesaler, after Helsinki refused to pay in rubles.\n\n\"Payments for gas supplied from April 1 must be made in rubles ... which the counterparties were informed of in a timely manner,\" Gazprom said, according to a report from Russian state news operator TASS.\n\nThe cutoff comes days after Finland and Sweden reversed a decades-old policy of neutrality and sought to join NATO.\n\n\"It is highly regrettable that natural gas supplies under our supply contract will now be halted,\" Gasum Chief Executive Mika Wiljanen said in a statement.\n\n\"However, we have been carefully preparing for this situation and provided that there will be no disruptions in the gas transmission network, we will be able to supply all our customers with gas in the coming months.\"\n\nThe NATO applications of Finland and Sweden have received enthusiastic support from the United States and most members of the transatlantic alliance -- with the notable exception of Turkey. Ankara's opposition threatens to block the membership of the Nordic countries. Turkey accuses the nations of lending support to Kurdish separatists whom it regards as terrorists.\n\nThe leaders of Finland and Sweden held separate telephone conversations with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday in attempts to assure him they will be respectful of Ankara's security concerns.\n\n\"Close dialogue continues,\" Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said afterward on Twitter.\n\nAnd in another sign of the war's increasing fallout beyond Ukraine's borders, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the small country of Moldova southwest of Ukraine should be equipped \"to NATO standard\" militarily so as to repulse any Russian aggression.\n\nSpeaking to the Telegraph newspaper on Saturday, Truss said Ukraine should be \"permanently able to defend itself\" along with \"vulnerable states\" such as Moldova.\n\n\"I would want to see Moldova equipped to NATO standard,\" she said. \"This is a discussion we're having with our allies.\"\n\nShe added that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"has been clear about his ambitions to create a greater Russia,\" which would presumably include parts of Moldova, which like Ukraine is a former Soviet republic.\n\n\"And just because his attempts to take Kyiv weren't successful doesn't mean he's abandoned those ambitions.\"\n\nElsewhere, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, a Russian defense ministry spokesman, said his forces destroyed an arms shipment sent by the U.S. and Europe to Ukraine's military.\n\n\"High-precision, long-range, sea-based Kalibr missiles in the area of the Malyn railway station in the Zhytomyr region destroyed a large batch of weapons and military equipment delivered from the United States and European countries,\" Konashenkov said in a statement Saturday.\n\nMalyn is about 60 miles northwest of Kyiv. Konashenkov said the weapons and materiel were to go to Ukrainian troops in the Donbas.\n\nThe Pentagon says Russian forces have repeatedly attempted to intercept shipments from the U.S. and NATO countries, which generally enter Ukraine over land from its western flank. Until now, the Pentagon has said the Russian attempts were unsuccessful. There was no immediate comment from Washington on Saturday's claim by Russia.\n\nAlso Saturday, President Joe Biden, traveling in Asia, signed into law a new $40 billion package of military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine -- the largest yet -- after it was approved with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress earlier in the past week.", "source": {"uri": "americanmilitarynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Military News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nabih_bulos@americanmilitarynews.com", "name": "Nabih Bulos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "patrick_j_mcdonnell@americanmilitarynews.com", "name": "Patrick J.

Earlier this month they were completely evacuated following painstaking negotiations coordinated by the UN and Red Cross that lasted for weeks.\n\nBut the continued refusal of the site's Ukrainian defenders to surrender meant Russia was unable to command complete control over the strategic port city.\n\nFor many Ukrainians, it also turned the Azovstal defenders into national heroes who symbolised the country's stubborn resistance.\n\nThe hundreds of soldiers holed up inside included marines, the National Guard (including the Azov regiment), border guards, police and territorial defence units.\n\nCamped out with diminishing food supplies and no water, they lived for weeks in underground bunkers and tunnels without seeing daylight.\n\nThe sprawling four-square-mile complex is a maze of tunnels designed to survive a nuclear war.\n\nTheir commander said all wounded troops had now been taken away by Russian buses and ambulances.\n\nAccording to Moscow officials, today's evacuation means a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters have now surrendered from the steel works in recent days.\n\nMoscow has released no information about where the soldiers who left today are being evacuated to, but previous buses have been sent to Russian-controlled territories.\n\nA video released by the Russian defence ministry, which the BBC has been unable to verify, appears to show a line of unarmed men approaching Russian soldiers outside the plant and giving their names.

Border guards, police officers, and territorial defense squads formed shortly before the war supplemented their ranks.\n\nThe bulk of these forces were deployed to defend Mariupol, home to a stategically located port, at the start of the Russian invasion. Marines from the 36th brigade held the port and another large plant in Mariupol for more than a month, until they ran out of supplies and ammunition.\n\nThey moved to the Azovstal steel mill to join the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right, and some of them were captured by the Russians.\n\nWHY DOES RUSSIA LABEL THEM 'NATIONALISTS'?\n\nIn announcing Azovstal's seizure, the Russian Defense Ministry's chief spokesman referred to the Azov Regiment's fighters as Nazis and said their commander was taken away in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred of him \"for numerous atrocities.\"\n\nNo evidence has surfaced of the regiment mistreating Ukrainian civilians, hundreds of whom sheltered underground with the fighters. The regiment released several videos taken inside Azovstal that showed their members interacting with the civilians and giving children sweets.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly made negative assertions about the Azov Regiment.\n\nThe National Guard unit grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that rose to bolster Ukraine's underfunded and questionably led military in the fight against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThat conflict broke out after massive protests drove Ukraine's Kremlin-leaning president from office.\n\nThe Azov Battalion drew its initial fighters from far-right circles and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. Its current members rejected accusations of nationalism and radicalism. Sviatoslav Palamar, the regiment's deputy commander, said in a recent interview from the steel mill that he preferred the term \"patriotism.\"\n\nWHAT DID THE DEFENDERS ACCOMPLISH?\n\nAs Mariupol became a symbol of the suffering and resistance of Ukrainians after Russia invaded their country, Ukrainian officials repeatedly stressed the role the fighters at Azovstal played in defending the city and stymying Russian progress elsewhere.\n\n\"The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol have already performed a feat, drawing the elite forces of the Russian army onto themselves and significantly slowing down the advance of the Russians in the southeast,\" Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said.\n\nAfter the plant's defenders were instructed to end their fight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the move was proper and humane because \"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle.\"\n\nThe ruined seaside city and the outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian fighters whose persistence frustrated Russia's objective to capture Mariupol quickly are now irrevocably etched into Ukrainian history, regardless of the outcome of the war.\n\nThe defense of Mariupol \"will go down in history as Thermopylae of the 21st century,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's president, said as the fighters started leaving the plant. \"The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy's plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war.\"\n\nThermopylae is widely considered one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing. They were killed to a man, including their king.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It achieved a major step towards that goal this week, when Ukraine ordered its garrison in the main Donbas port, Mariupol, to stand down after a near three-month siege.\n\nRussia's Shoigu said around 2,000 Ukrainian fighters had surrendered so far at the huge Azovstal metalworks.\n\nKyiv has not confirmed how many fighters have surrendered, but Britain gave the first official Western confirmation that a large Ukrainian force had laid down arms, estimating the number at around 1,700. An unknown number were still believed to be inside, it said.\n\nZelenskiy said on Friday Ukraine's military command had given the defenders a clear signal that they could come out and save their lives, and he expected all to be out within days.\n\nIn a video, the commander of the Azov Battalion, a Ukrainian unit that had defended the plant, confirmed the order to stop fighting was being implemented, and said all civilians and wounded fighters were now out.\n\nThe dead were being removed from underground tunnels and bunkers, said the commander, Denys Prokopenko: \"I hope that in the near future, relatives and Ukraine will be able to bury their soldiers with honour.\"\n\nNatalia Zarytska, wife of an Azovstal fighter who surrendered, said she had not heard from him since a 10-minute message exchange on Telegram two days ago. She believed he was still alive and would one day return home.\n\n\"The situation is really hard and horrible and my husband is on the way from one hell to another hell, from Azovstal steel plant to a prison, to captivity,\" Zarytska said in Istanbul, where she and other family members lobbied Turkey to try to help save the fighters.\n\nThe Red Cross says it has registered hundreds of Ukrainians who surrendered at the plant as prisoners of war, but has given no firm numbers.

That's how many Ukrainian soldiers are likely to have surrendered at the Azovstal steel plant, the ministry said. The plant was Ukraine's last bastion of resistance in Mariupol after the rest of the city was reduced to ruins following months of Russian bombing. Ukrainian fighters, who surrendered on Monday, had been holed up in a sprawling network of tunnels and shelters under the steelworks for weeks after Russia claimed control of the rest of Mariupol. \"An unknown number of Ukrainian forces remain inside the factory,\" the British ministry said.\n\nCapturing Mariupol has been a critical objective for Russia during its invasion. The city is strategically located on the Sea of Azov and an important economic center and trading hub for Ukraine. Crucially, control over Mariupol is key to creating an unobstructed land bridge between Russia and Crimea, which Moscow illegally annexed in 2014, and a huge propaganda win for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Its resistance, particularly the siege at the steel factory, has prevented Russia from deploying troops to its new focus in Donbas.\n\nThe fate of the Azovstal fighters. It's uncertain what will happen to the surrendered steelworks fighters. Some -- nearly 1,000 -- have been taken to a prison colony in Russian-controlled territory. Kyiv is calling for a prisoner exchange to have the soldiers swapped for Russian prisoners of war. Signals from Moscow, however, suggest Russia may put the fighters on trial for \"war crimes.\"\n\nUkraine Effectively Surrenders Mariupol -- Here's Why The City Is Such A Prized Target For Russia (Forbes)", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_hart@forbes.com", "name": "Robert Hart", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve//62875fdf660bd49a3e5b113f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2716,1529,x0,y56,safe&width=1200", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 12, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 16, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7048658829", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "16:14:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T16:14:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T15:08:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5960784554481506, "url": "https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2022/05/20/russia-ramps-up-assault/", "title": "Russia ramps up assault aiming to seize Ukrainian province for separatists", "body": "KYIV (Reuters) -Russian troops bombarded a riverside city on Friday in what appeared to herald a major assault to seize the last remaining Ukrainian-held territory in a province it claims on behalf of separatists.\n\nUkrainian officials said Russian forces had launched massive artillery bombardment against Sievierodonetsk, one of the last Ukrainian-held bastions in Luhansk, one of two southeastern provinces Moscow and its proxies proclaim as independent states.\n\nThe city, and its twin Lyshchansk on the opposite bank of the Siverskiy Donets river, form the eastern part of a Ukrainian-held pocket that Russia has been trying to overrun since mid-April after failing to capture the capital Kyiv.\n\nUkraine's general staff said Moscow had launched an offensive on Sievierodonetsk but had taken losses and was forced to retreat, part of what it described as major Russian offensive operations along a stretch of the frontline.\n\nDespite losing ground elsewhere in recent weeks, Russian forces have advanced on the Luhansk front, in what some military analysts view as a major push to achieve scaled-down war aims of capturing all territory claimed by pro-Russian rebels.\n\n\"The Russian army has started very intensive destruction of the town of Sievierodonetsk, the intensity of shelling doubled, they are shelling residential quarters, destroying house by house,\" Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said via his Telegram channel.\n\n\"We do not know how many people died, because it is simply impossible to go through and look at every apartment,\" he said.\n\nIn Moscow, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the \"liberation of the Luhansk People's Republic\" would be completed soon.\n\nIn an overnight address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy described the conditions in the Donbas, which includes Luhansk and neighbouring Donetsk province, as \"hell\" and said the region had been \"completely destroyed\" by Russia's invasion.\n\nCapturing Luhansk and Donetsk would allow Moscow to claim victory after it announced last month that this was now its objective. It achieved a major step towards that goal this week, when Ukraine ordered its garrison in the main Donbas port, Mariupol, to stand down after a near three-month siege.\n\nRussia's Shoigu said around 2,000 Ukrainian fighters had surrendered in the past four days.\n\nKyiv has not confirmed how many fighters have surrendered, but Britain gave the first official Western confirmation that a large force had indeed laid down arms, saying around 1,700 had surrendered.

Moscow says they will be treated humanely, but Russian politicians have been quoted as saying some must be tried for crimes or even executed.\n\nFOOD AS HOSTAGE\n\nThe past week has seen Sweden and Finland apply to join NATO, the biggest shakeup in European security for decades, although Turkey has so far said it will block the move, accusing the Nordic countries of harbouring Kurdish militants.\n\nAfter weeks of threatening to retaliate, Putin appears to have climbed down, saying this week that NATO membership for Finland and Sweden did not represent a threat as such, unless the alliance sends new weapons or troops.

Putin has stopped short of declaring his \"special military operation\" to be a war, which would make it easier to mobilise reservists and conscripts.\n\nWestern powers, who have strongly condemned Russia's actions and sought to isolate Moscow with an array of sanctions, were stepping up support for Ukraine.

Border guards, police officers, and territorial defense squads formed shortly before the war supplemented their ranks.\n\nThe bulk of these forces were deployed to defend Mariupol, home to a stategically located port, at the start of the Russian invasion. Marines from the 36th brigade held the port and another large plant in Mariupol for more than a month, until they ran out of supplies and ammunition.\n\nThey moved to the Azovstal steel mill to join the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right, and some of them were captured by the Russians.\n\nWHY DOES RUSSIA LABEL THEM 'NATIONALISTS'?\n\nIn announcing Azovstal's seizure, the Russian Defense Ministry's chief spokesman referred to the Azov Regiment's fighters as Nazis and said their commander was taken away in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred of him \"for numerous atrocities.\"\n\nNo evidence has surfaced of the regiment mistreating Ukrainian civilians, hundreds of whom sheltered underground with the fighters. The regiment released several videos taken inside Azovstal that showed their members interacting with the civilians and giving children sweets.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly made negative assertions about the Azov Regiment.\n\nThe National Guard unit grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that rose to bolster Ukraine's underfunded and questionably led military in the fight against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThat conflict broke out after massive protests drove Ukraine's Kremlin-leaning president from office.\n\nThe Azov Battalion drew its initial fighters from far-right circles and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. Its current members rejected accusations of nationalism and radicalism. Sviatoslav Palamar, the regiment's deputy commander, said in a recent interview from the steel mill that he preferred the term \"patriotism.\"\n\nWHAT DID THE DEFENDERS ACCOMPLISH?\n\nAs Mariupol became a symbol of the suffering and resistance of Ukrainians after Russia invaded their country, Ukrainian officials repeatedly stressed the role the fighters at Azovstal played in defending the city and stymying Russian progress elsewhere.\n\n\"The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol have already performed a feat, drawing the elite forces of the Russian army onto themselves and significantly slowing down the advance of the Russians in the southeast,\" Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said.\n\nAfter the plant's defenders were instructed to end their fight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the move was proper and humane because \"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle.\"\n\nThe ruined seaside city and the outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian fighters whose persistence frustrated Russia's objective to capture Mariupol quickly are now irrevocably etched into Ukrainian history, regardless of the outcome of the war.\n\nThe defense of Mariupol \"will go down in history as Thermopylae of the 21st century,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's president, said as the fighters started leaving the plant. \"The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy's plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war.\"\n\nThermopylae is widely considered one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing. They were killed to a man, including their king.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

UK armed forces minister James Heappey estimated this week that \"tens of thousands\" have lost their lives since the start of the conflict on February 24.\n\nIn its daily intelligence briefing, the Ministry of Defence said more Russian forces could be killed as President Putin's commanders come \"under pressure\" to hurry troops from Mariupol in the south, which is now largely under Russian control, to the Donbas.\n\nThe MoD said: \"Staunch Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol since the start of the war means Russian forces in the area must be re-equipped and refurbished before they can be redeployed effectively. This can be a lengthy process when done thoroughly. Russian commanders, however, are under pressure to demonstrably achieve operational objectives. This means that Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition.\"\n\nMariupol -- a strategic port city on the Azov Sea -- has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. It has been targeted with relentless bombardment since the start of the war, with thousands of troops and civilians trapped inside the Azovstal steel plant.\n\nThe MoD said 1,700 Ukrainian troops had now surrendered from the sprawling complex but it was unknown how many remained inside.\n\nSpeaking during his nightly address from Kyiv, Mr Zelensky set out the scale of destruction. He said: \"[There are] constant strikes on the Odesa region, on the cities of central Ukraine.\n\nThe Donbas is completely destroyed,\" he said. \"All this has not and cannot have any military explanation for Russia.

Although the Russians had captured most of Mariupol by end-March, they were unable to claim victory. The Ukrainians continued to hold on to a major asset that played a key role in Mariupol's economy: Azovstal Iron and Steel Works.\n\nThe sprawling industrial complex, which employed more than 10,000 workers and covered 11 sq. km in the port city's water front, had seen fierce fighting for weeks. It was with the aim of claiming total control over the city that the Russians had mounted a brutal siege of the steel plant, subjecting it to intense artillery fire, aerial bombardment, and missile strikes.\n\nUkraine had sent some of its best fighters to defend Mariupol, including the 36th Marine Brigade and the National Guard's Azov Regiment. More than 2,000 of them had made the Azovstal steel plant their last stand. They used the plant's vast network of underground tunnels and passages -- estimated to be 24 km long -- to frequently shift their positions and surprise the Russians. It was in this context that on April 21, in a televised meeting with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, President Vladimir Putin announced a change in strategy: Russia will no longer attempt to 'capture' the Azovstal steel plant. Instead, Mr. Putin instructed Mr. Shoigu to seal off the industrial complex so that \"not even a fly could get through\". The rest of Mariupol was already in their control. So Russia might as well wait it out until the trapped Ukrainians ran out of supplies, and when that happens, they would have no choice but to surrender. The calculation proved to be accurate.\n\nThe Azovstal steel plant, a Soviet-era structure inaugurated in 1933, has seen military action before -- it was captured by the Nazis in 1941 and they left it in ruins when they withdrew in 1943. But it was quickly rebuilt and became one of the largest metallurgical facilities in Europe, producing 4 million tonnes of crude steel annually. Crucially, like many large factories of the Soviet era, it had well-stocked bunkers that could accommodate 4,000 people.\n\nBut this April, as Russia sealed off the complex, those inside began to run out of food, water and medical supplies. Apart from the Ukrainian soldiers, there were also civilians inside. The Russian border is barely 60 km from Mariupol. When Moscow launched its 'special military operation' on February 24, thousands of Mariupol residents -- many of them family members of plant workers -- fled to the safety of its bunkers. Most of them had assumed that they were going to stay there for a few days. But as the Russian siege went on, the civilians remained trapped.\n\nDiplomatic efforts were made to negotiate their evacuation. After several false starts, all women and children were evacuated by May 8. Ukrainian soldiers and male civilians remained trapped inside, and with supplies running low, they appealed to President Volodymyr Zelensky for help, in vain. Finally, on May 16, the Ukrainian military ordered the commanders in Azovstal \"to save the lives of the personnel\". Official statements avoided the term 'surrender'. Over the following days, according to the Russian military, a total of 1,730 Ukrainian troops surrendered and were taken to camps in territories controlled by Russia.\n\nAlthough the military significance of the Russian victory at the Azovstal plant is limited, it does hold great value in ideological and psychological terms. In the preceding weeks, the site had become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. There were widely circulated reports of Ukrainian soldiers preferring \"death by combat\" and \"fighting to the last man\" rather than laying down arms in front of the Russians. In this context, the Ukrainian surrender would be invaluable fodder for Russian propaganda. The Ukrainian military, however, has maintained that its troops at the Azovstal plant had successfully completed their \"combat mission\", which was to keep a large number of Russian troops bogged down in Mariupol so that they could not be deployed to other, more critical, battle fronts.\n\nWhile the fate of these Ukrainian soldiers remains uncertain, there is little doubt that Moscow is now closer than ever to achieving its objective of securing a land bridge from Russia to Crimea.", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/uc12p7/article65443640.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_615/APTOPIX_Russia_Ukraine_Mariupol_Defenders_Photo_Gallery_75179.jpg-e2e4d.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 19, "stanza_neu": 12, "stanza_pos": 4, "swn_neg": 35, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7050174763", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-22", "time": "06:28:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-22T06:28:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-22T06:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5921568870544434, "url": "https://www.albawaba.com/news/zelensky-accuses-russia-trying-kill-many-ukrainians-possible-1477663", "title": "Zelensky Accuses Russia of Trying to Kill 'as Many Ukrainians' as Possible | Al Bawaba", "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia overnight of trying to \"kill as many Ukrainians as possible\" and not having a military justification for some of its targets.\n\nThe comments were some of Zelensky's sternest yet against Russia, which invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\n\"In Donbas, the occupiers are trying to increase pressure,\" Zelensky said in a statement. \"There's hell, and that's not an exaggeration.

That ended the most destructive siege of the war.\n\n\"The territory of the Azovstal metallurgical plant ... has been completely liberated,\" the ministry said in a statement, adding that 2,439 defenders had surrendered in the past few days, including 531 in the final group.\n\nHours earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the last defenders at the steelworks had been told by Ukraine's military that they could get out and save their lives. The Ukrainians did not immediately confirm the figures on Azovstal.\n\nRussia also launched what appeared to be a major assault to seize the last remaining Ukrainian-held territory in the province of Luhansk, one of two southeastern Ukrainian provinces Moscow proclaims as independent states.\n\n\"The Russian army has started very intensive destruction of the town of Sievierodonetsk, the intensity of shelling doubled, they are shelling residential quarters, destroying house by house,\" Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said on his Telegram channel.\n\nIn early hours on Saturday, air raid sirens were going off in much of Ukraine, including in the Kyiv capital region and the southern port of Odesa.\n\nCapturing Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, much of which make up Ukraine's industrial Donbas region, would allow Moscow to claim a victory after announcing last month that this was now its objective.\n\nDespite losing ground elsewhere in recent weeks, Russian forces have advanced on the Luhansk front.\n\n\"This will be the critical next few weeks of the conflict,\" said Mathieu Boulegue, an expert at London's Chatham House think tank. \"And it depends on how effective they are at conquering Sievierodonetsk and the lands across it.\"\n\nUkraine's general staff said it had pushed back an offensive on Sievierodonetsk, part of what it described as major Russian operations along a stretch of the front line.\n\nIn Moscow, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the \"liberation of the Luhansk People's Republic\" would be over soon.\n\nBATTLE FOR MARIUPOL\n\nThe end of the Mariupol siege was an important symbolic moment for Russia, after a series of setbacks since the invasion began on Feb. 24, but it came at the cost of massive destruction.\n\nZelenskiy said the region had been \"completely destroyed\" by Russia and proposed a formal deal with the country's allies to secure Russian compensation for the damage its forces had caused.\n\nNatalia Zarytska, wife of an Azovstal fighter who surrendered, said she had not heard from him since a Telegram message exchange two days ago.

Ukraine says it has recaptured 23 settlements near Kharkiv in the last two weeks.\n\nAs the invasion nears the three-month mark, the Group of Seven rich nations agreed to provide Ukraine with $18.4 billion to pay its bills. Ukraine said the money would speed up victory over Russia and was just as important as \"the weapons you provide.\"\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters: \"The message was, 'We stand behind Ukraine.

The White House is working to put advanced anti-ship missiles in the hands of Ukrainian fighters to help defeat Russia's naval blockade, officials said.\n\nAnd in a further sign of Western action hurting the Russian economy, five foreign vice-presidents of Russia's Rosneft have resigned because of EU sanctions forbidding European citizens or Russians living in the EU to work at the oil company, sources said.\n\nThe EU said it is looking into ways of using the frozen assets of Russian oligarchs to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, while the United States has not ruled out possibly placing sanctions on countries that purchase Russian oil.\n\nBut Western divisions have also been on show with NATO member Turkey opposed to Sweden and Finland joining the alliance, a move that would reverse generations of military non-alignment in the biggest European security shake-up in decades.\n\nAnkara accuses the two Nordic states of harboring Kurdish militants, but US President Joe Biden and European leaders said they were confident Turkey's concerns could be addressed.\n\nBiden, hosting Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson and Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 at the White House, told reporters, \"I think we're going to be okay.\"\n\nNiinisto said Finland would commit to Turkey's security, adding, \"We condemn terrorism in all its forms and we are actively engaged in combating it.\"\n\nIn Mariupol, the ultimate outcome of the bloodiest battle in Europe for decades has remained unclear, with uncertainty over the fate of hundreds of Ukrainian defenders.\n\nMoscow said on Thursday that 1,730 Ukrainian fighters had surrendered so far, including 771 in the past 24 hours.\n\nUkrainian officials, who have sought a prisoner swap, had declined to comment, saying it could endanger rescue efforts.\n\nLate on Thursday, Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy head of the Azov Regiment defending the steelworks, released an 18-second video in which he said he and other commanders were still on the territory of the plant.\n\n\"A certain operation is going on, the details of which I will not disclose,\" he said.\n\nThe Switzerland-based International Committee of the Red Cross said it has registered hundreds of prisoners from the plant now held by Russia, but it has not given a precise number.\n\nThe leader of Russian-backed separatists in control of the area said nearly half of the fighters remained inside the steelworks, where underground bunkers and tunnels had protected them from weeks of Russian bombardment.\n\n\"More than half have laid down their arms,\" Denis Pushilin told the Solovyov Live internet television channel.\n\nThe wounded were given medical treatment while those who were fit were taken to a penal colony and were being treated well, he said.\n\nRussia denies it agreed to a prisoner swap.

It achieved a major step towards that goal this week, when Ukraine ordered its garrison in the main Donbas port, Mariupol, to stand down after a near three-month siege.\n\nRussia's Shoigu said around 2,000 Ukrainian fighters had surrendered in the past four days.\n\nKyiv has not confirmed how many fighters have surrendered, but Britain gave the first official Western confirmation that a large force had indeed laid down arms, saying around 1,700 had surrendered. An unknown number of others were still believed to be inside, it said.\n\nIn a video, the commander of the Azov Batalion, a Ukrainian unit that had defended the plant, confirmed the order to stop fighting was being carried out, and said all civilians and wounded fighters were now out.\n\nDenys Prokopenko, the commander, gave no further details of the fate of other fighters, but said a process was under way to remove the dead from the warren of underground tunnels and bunkers.\n\n\"I hope that in the near future, relatives and Ukraine will be able to bury their soldiers with honour,\" Prokopenko said.\n\nThe Red Cross says it has registered hundreds of prisoners of war who surrendered at the plant, but has given no firm numbers or further details.\n\nKyiv says it wants to arrange a prisoner swap for Azovstal defenders it describes as national heroes.

Nevertheless, Defence Minister Shoigu said on Friday Moscow planned to beef up its forces nearby in response to what he called new threats.\n\nRussian forces in Ukraine have been driven in recent weeks out of the area around Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv, their fastest retreat since being forced out of the north and the area around Kyiv at the end of March.\n\nBut they still control a large swathe of the south and east, and the end of fighting in Mariupol means that territory is now largely unbroken. Still, military analysts say Russia has been using up its offensive firepower and may be running out of time to achieve its aim of capturing the whole Donbas.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's aim to boost its war effort, the parliament in Moscow said it would consider a bill to allow Russians over 40 and foreigners over 30 to sign up for the military. Putin has stopped short of declaring his \"special military operation\" to be a war, which would make it easier to mobilise reservists and conscripts.\n\nWestern powers, who have strongly condemned Russia's actions and sought to isolate Moscow with an array of sanctions, were stepping up support for Ukraine. The Group of Seven on Thursday agreed to provide Ukraine with $18.4 billion to make up revenues as the war wrecks its economy.\n\nThe U.S. Senate approved nearly $40 billion in new aid, by far the largest U.S. aid package to date. The sum amounts to more than a quarter of Ukraine's pre-war annual GDP.\n\nThe White House is also working to get advanced anti-ship missiles to Ukraine to help defeat Russia's naval blockade, which has halted exports from one of the world's main grain suppliers, causing what the United Nations says could be a global food crisis.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Russia of using food as a weapon, holding supplies \"hostage\" for millions around the world.\n\n(Reporting by Natalia Zinets, Max Hunder, Tom Balmforth in Kyiv and Reuters bureaux; Writing by Peter Graff; Editing by Nick Macfie)", "source": {"uri": "theinfostride.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The InfoStride"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ifeanyi_n@theinfostride.com", "name": "Ifeanyi N.", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.theinfostride.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ukraines-Territorial-Defense-Forces.webp", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 22, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 35, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049068939", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "01:21:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T01:21:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T01:21:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5921568870544434, "url": "https://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-2678857", "title": "Russia declares final victory at steel plant in Mariupol and fights for more territory in eastern Ukraine", "body": "KYIV, Ukraine -- With full control of the steel plant that transfixed the world for month and a tightened grip on Ukraine's southern coast, Russia redoubled its assault Friday on the eastern industrial heartland known as the Donbas.\n\nIn the vicinity of Severodonetsk -- the region's easternmost city still in Ukrainian hands -- at least a dozen people were killed and scores of homes destroyed, the regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, reported on social media.\n\nThe nearby city of Lysychansk also came under sustained fire, according to Ukrainian military officials, who said their troops had repelled a series of attacks in the Donbas over the last 24 hours, destroying 14 armored vehicles and shooting down a Russian drone.\n\nAnd about 120 miles west in the Kharkiv region, a Russian missile destroyed the newly renovated Palace of Culture in the city of Lozova.\n\nRussian military authorities also made their biggest victory of the war official on Friday, announcing that their forces in the southern port city of Mariupol had \"completely liberated\" the sprawling Azovstal steel plant, where thousands of Ukrainian fighters had hunkered down for more than two months in a brutal standoff.\n\nMaj. Gen.

Border guards, police officers, and territorial defense squads formed shortly before the war supplemented their ranks.\n\nThe bulk of these forces were deployed to defend Mariupol, home to a stategically located port, at the start of the Russian invasion. Marines from the 36th brigade held the port and another large plant in Mariupol for more than a month, until they ran out of supplies and ammunition.\n\nThey moved to the Azovstal steel mill to join the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right, and some of them were captured by the Russians.\n\nWHY DOES RUSSIA LABEL THEM 'NATIONALISTS'?\n\nIn announcing Azovstal's seizure, the Russian Defense Ministry's chief spokesman referred to the Azov Regiment's fighters as Nazis and said their commander was taken away in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred of him \"for numerous atrocities.\"\n\nNo evidence has surfaced of the regiment mistreating Ukrainian civilians, hundreds of whom sheltered underground with the fighters. The regiment released several videos taken inside Azovstal that showed their members interacting with the civilians and giving children sweets.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly made negative assertions about the Azov Regiment.\n\nThe National Guard unit grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that rose to bolster Ukraine's underfunded and questionably led military in the fight against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThat conflict broke out after massive protests drove Ukraine's Kremlin-leaning president from office.\n\nThe Azov Battalion drew its initial fighters from far-right circles and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. Its current members rejected accusations of nationalism and radicalism. Sviatoslav Palamar, the regiment's deputy commander, said in a recent interview from the steel mill that he preferred the term \"patriotism.\"\n\nWHAT DID THE DEFENDERS ACCOMPLISH?\n\nAs Mariupol became a symbol of the suffering and resistance of Ukrainians after Russia invaded their country, Ukrainian officials repeatedly stressed the role the fighters at Azovstal played in defending the city and stymying Russian progress elsewhere.\n\n\"The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol have already performed a feat, drawing the elite forces of the Russian army onto themselves and significantly slowing down the advance of the Russians in the southeast,\" Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said.\n\nAfter the plant's defenders were instructed to end their fight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the move was proper and humane because \"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle.\"\n\nThe ruined seaside city and the outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian fighters whose persistence frustrated Russia's objective to capture Mariupol quickly are now irrevocably etched into Ukrainian history, regardless of the outcome of the war.\n\nThe defense of Mariupol \"will go down in history as Thermopylae of the 21st century,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's president, said as the fighters started leaving the plant. \"The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy's plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war.\"\n\nThermopylae is widely considered one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.

Ukraine says it has recaptured 23 settlements near Kharkiv in the last two weeks.\n\nAs the invasion nears the three-month mark, the Group of Seven rich nations agreed to provide Ukraine with $18.4 billion to pay its bills. Ukraine said the money would speed up victory over Russia and was just as important as \"the weapons you provide\".\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters: \"The message was, 'We stand behind Ukraine. We're going to pull together with the resources that they need to get through this.'\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal had written on Twitter, \"Support of partners will speed up our victory...

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nPOKROVSK, Ukraine (AP) -- The West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine on Friday, as Russia shifted troops freed up by the imminent fall of the pulverized city of Mariupol and fighting raged in the country's industrial heartland in the east.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking eastern expanse of coal mines and factories that Russian President Vladimir Putin is bent on capturing.\n\n'Under cover of darkness': The inside story of how the Rams worked the NFL and ditched St. Louis Editorial: The day could be approaching when Supreme Court rulings are openly defied Ladue graduate among leaders who fought for equal pay for US women's soccer players 'He was gone': 32 years after teen vanished, St. Louis police tap genetic forensics to solve case Augusta winery investor steps down, taps sons to lead $100M plan Wainwright-Molina battery is supercharged: Pujols allows four runs in ninth in 15-6 Cardinals romp Missing man who fell from canoe had no life jacket, clung to seat cushion on Missouri River Two dead in south St. Louis County after fatal shooting blamed on domestic altercation Hummel: What does the future hold for DeJong, Dickerson and Reyes?

Russia said more than 1,900 had surrendered in recent days. Also remaining at the plant were the bodies of soldiers who defended it while tying down Russian forces.\n\nDenis Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, which led the defense of the plant, called them \"fallen heroes.\"\n\n\"I hope soon relatives and the whole of Ukraine will be able to bury the fighters with honors,\" he said.\n\nWives of fighters who held out at the steelworks spoke emotionally about what may have been their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\nMeanwhile, fighting intensified deeper in the Donbas.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces were especially focused on the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway, the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The road is extremely important because it's the only connection to other regions of the country,\" he said via email. \"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region.\"\n\nRussian forces shelled the road constantly from multiple directions, but Ukrainian armored transports were still able to get through, Haidai added.\n\nMoscow's troops have been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas. One of Friday's attacks was on a school in Severodonetsk that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, Haidai said. Three adults were killed, he said on Telegram.\n\nTwelve people were killed in Severodonetsk, Haidai said. It was not immediately clear if that included the three at the school. In addition, more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nRussian forces now control 90 percent of Luhansk, but the attack on Severodonetsk failed -- \"the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated,\" Haidai said. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nPro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas for the past eight years and held a considerable swath of it before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. But the effort by Putin's troops to take more territory there has been slow-going.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, Britain's Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian forces elsewhere in Ukraine continued to blast away at targets, some of them civilian.\n\nIn the village of Velyka Kostromka, west of the Donbas, explosions in the middle of the night Thursday shook Iryna Martsyniuk's house to its foundations. Roof timbers splintered and windows shattered, sending shards of glass into a wall near three sleeping children.\n\n\"There were flashes everywhere,\" she said. \"There was smoke everywhere.\" She grabbed the children and ran toward the home's entrance, \"but the corridor wasn't there anymore. Instead, we saw the starry night.\"\n\nThey ran down the road to a neighbor's home, where they hid in the basement.\n\nAround 20 other houses were damaged and two people were lightly wounded, said Olha Shaytanova, head of the village.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

It achieved a major step towards that goal this week, when Ukraine ordered the garrison in Mariupol, the main Donbas port, to stand down.\n\nNatalia Zarytska, wife of an Azovstal fighter who surrendered, said she had not heard from him since a Telegram message exchange two days ago. She believed he was still alive.\n\n\"The situation is really hard and horrible and my husband is on the way from one hell to another hell, from Azovstal steel plant to a prison, to captivity,\" Zarytska said in Istanbul, where she and other relatives lobbied Turkey to help save the fighters.\n\nThe Red Cross said it has registered hundreds of Ukrainians who surrendered at the plant as prisoners of war and Kyiv says it wants a prisoner swap. Moscow says the prisoners will be treated humanely, but Russian politicians have been quoted as saying some must be tried or even executed.\n\nRussian forces in Ukraine have been driven in recent weeks from the area surrounding Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv, their fastest retreat since being forced out of the north and the Kyiv region at the end of March.\n\nBut they still control a large swathe of the south and east, and the end of fighting in Mariupol means that territory is now largely unbroken.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's aim to boost its war effort, the parliament in Moscow said it would consider letting Russians over 40 and foreigners over 30 join the military.\n\nThe past week has also seen Sweden and Finland apply to join NATO, although Turkey has threatened to block them, accusing the Nordic countries of harbouring Kurdish militants.\n\nAfter weeks of threatening to retaliate, Putin said this week Finnish or Swedish NATO membership did not represent a threat unless the alliance sends new weapons or troops. Nevertheless, Shoigu said on Friday Moscow planned to beef up its forces nearby in response to what he called new threats.\n\n(Reporting by Natalia Zinets, Max Hunder, Tom Balmforth in Kyiv and Reuters bureaux; Writing by Peter Graff and Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Nick Macfie and Rosalba O'Brien)", "source": {"uri": "shorenewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shore News Network"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@shorenewsnetwork.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/Reuters_Direct_Media/USOnlineReportTopNews/tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI4J0YR-BASEIMAGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 20, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 31, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049583182", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "13:28:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T13:28:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T12:31:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5882353186607361, "url": "https://kion546.com/news/2022/05/21/its-nearly-three-months-since-russia-invaded-ukraine-heres-where-things-stand/", "title": "It's nearly three months since Russia invaded Ukraine. Here's where things stand - KION546", "body": "It is nearly three months since Russia invaded Ukraine -- a 12-week period in which Russian forces have wrought devastation on the country and its people, resulting in death on a vast scale and causing millions to flee.\n\nBut the invasion has not been the military success Moscow hoped, and is now deep into its second phase.\n\nThe bulk of fighting has moved to the east, after failed Russian advances in central Ukraine. The defenders are even focusing on retaking some key areas nearer the Russian border, while Moscow is seeing its troops beaten back in a few key battles.\n\nWestern aid is also flowing into Ukraine, NATO is set to be strengthened as countries seek to join, and the first Russian soldier accused of war crimes has stood trial.\n\nHere's what has happened in several key areas since the war began.\n\nAfter weeks of intense fighting, Ukraine's eastern Donbas region is \"completely destroyed,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday.\n\nHe accused Russia of a \"deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible\" after a village in Chernihiv was hit with missiles, leaving many dead.\n\nOfficials in the region say the front line is being shelled \"day and night,\" with Russian forces attempting to break through Ukrainian lines.\n\nA NATO military official told CNN Wednesday that the alliance expects something of a stalemate over the next few weeks. But the official said NATO believes momentum has shifted significantly in favor of Ukraine and the debate within NATO circles is now over whether it is possible for Kyiv to retake Crimea and the Donbas territories seized by Russia and Russian-backed separatists, respectively, in 2014.\n\nUkrainian forces have beaten back Russia's assaults in Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv, and advanced toward the border in several places north and east of the city.\n\nUkrainian officials said last week they were liberating villages on the outskirts of the city. Their advances led to the symbolic and embarrassing expulsion of the Kremlin's forces back to their own border while posing the strategic threat of cutting Russia's supply lines into Ukraine and its forces further south in Donbas.\n\nAnastasia Paraskevova recently returned to her home in Kharkiv for the first time since fleeing the city two months ago. It had been under constant bombardment since then, until Russian forces were repelled.\n\nParaskevova said overall the experience was good. \"The city was much more alive. People were walking the streets. And some shops were working. It felt like some life was back, much better than it was when I was here in March.\"\n\nEvery day, hundreds, or even thousands, of people are trying to flee the Russian-occupied region of Kherson in southern Ukraine.\n\nThe city has been under Russian control since early in the invasion. Ukrainians are leaving for many reasons: to avoid being detained or to escape the heavy-handed actions of Russian forces, or because of the chronic shortages of medicine and other basics in Kherson, which fell under Russian control soon after the invasion.\n\nLast week, a convoy of about 1,000 vehicles tried to leave Kherson. The Russians ultimately let the convoy move in batches -- but only after holding it in one place for most of the day.\n\nMariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, finally fell to Russian forces after weeks of relentless bombardment.\n\nThe city was the scene of some of the most intense fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. It was there that Russia carried out deadly strikes on a maternity ward and the bombing of a theater where hundreds of civilians had sought refuge from the violence.\n\nMariupol became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance as its defenders held out at Azovstal, a sprawling steelworks plant where as many as 1,000 civilians had taken shelter at one point, with stocks of food and water dwindling.\n\nUkraine's military announced late Monday that its forces had completed their \"combat mission\" at Azovstal, effectively ceding the city to Russian forces. On Friday, Ukraine ordered its forces to stop defending the plant.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Friday that almost 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers have surrendered at Azovstal. CNN cannot independently verify that figure.\n\nWith the city now almost fully under Russian control, there is concern that evidence of any potential war crimes -- like those allegedly committed in Bucha and Borodianka -- could be lost or destroyed.\n\nMore evidence of potential Russian war crimes is emerging in Bucha, the northern Ukrainian city near Kyiv, the capital. An investigation by The New York Times alleged that Russian paratroopers carried out summary executions of at least eight Ukrainian men in Bucha on March 4.\n\nEvidence of mass graves and civilian executions in the towns of Bucha and Borodianka has continued to emerge since early April, following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Kyiv region.\n\nImages of bodies lying strewn the streets of Bucha have sparked international condemnation and fueled calls for an investigation into potential Russian war crimes.\n\nCNN visited the scene of mass graves in Bucha in April after Russian forces had withdrawn, revealing the horrors of their occupation to the world. Correspondent Fred Pleitgen was among the first to reach a mass grave that residents dug while the place was under Russian occupation, because so many residents had been killed and longer burial ceremonies would have been too dangerous amid the shooting and shelling.\n\nThis week saw the start of the first war crimes trial in Ukraine since the invasion began. A 21-year-old Russian soldier named Vadim Shishimarin pleaded guilty to killing an unarmed 62-year-old man.\n\nThe trial's first day was so packed with journalists that authorities in Kyiv were forced to move to bigger venue. It has since produced several dramatic moments, including a confrontation between the soldier and the victim's widow and testimony from Shishimarin himself.\n\nSpeaking Friday, Shishimarin acknowledged he was responsible for the killing but was \"sorry and sincerely repents.\"\n\n\"I was nervous the moment it happened. I didn't want to kill. But it happened and I do not deny it,\" he said.\n\nShishimarin's lawyer, Viktor Ovsyannikov, argued that while his client was guilty of killing, it was not murder.\n\n\"Shishimarin was in a state of stress caused by the combat situation and the pressure from his commander. Analysis of those circumstances allows me to conclude that Shishimarin had no direct intent for the murder,\" Ovsyannikov said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that Russia has no details about Shishimarin's case and it considers the charges \"unacceptable,\" \"outrageous\" and \"staged.\"\n\nForeign diplomatic missions started coming back to life in Kyiv this week, after diplomats fled the city en masse at the beginning of the conflict.\n\nThe US flag was raised over the United States Embassy to mark the official resumption operations on Wednesday, while the Swiss Foreign Ministry said Thursday it would also reopen its embassy.\n\nUS lawmakers passed a bill Thursday that will send roughly $40 billion to Ukraine to pay for military and humanitarian aid, including funding that will assist Ukrainian military and national security forces, help replenish stores of US equipment sent to Ukraine and provide public health and medical support for Ukrainian refugees.\n\nUS President Joseph Biden signed the aid package while he was in South Korea.\n\nHelsinki and Stockholm had, for decades, avoided joining the alliance, but cited Moscow's invasion as the ultimate impetus to do so now. The two countries formally handed in their applications Wednesday.\n\nMost NATO members appear ready to support both bids, except for Turkey.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday that his country \"will say no to Sweden's and Finland's entry into NATO,\" citing their support for the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The PKK seeks an independent state in Turkey and has been in an armed struggle with Ankara for decades. It has been designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.\n\nSome experts say Erdogan may be angling for concessions or to highlight grievances Turkey wishes to bring to the attention of the international community.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The last Ukrainian forces holed up in Mariupol's smashed Azovstal steelworks surrendered on Friday, Russia's defense ministry said. That ended the most destructive siege of the war.\n\n\"The territory of the Azovstal metallurgical plant ... has been completely liberated,\" the ministry said in a statement, adding that 2,439 defenders had surrendered in the past few days, including 531 in the final group. Hours earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the last defenders at the steelworks had been told by Ukraine's military that they could get out and save their lives. The Ukrainians did not immediately confirm the figures on Azovstal.\n\nUkraine's General Staff of Armed Forces did not comment on Russia's claim in its morning update on Saturday. Russia also launched what appeared to be a major assault to seize the last remaining Ukrainian-held territory in Luhansk, one of two southeastern Ukrainian provinces Moscow proclaims as independent states.\n\nSerhiy Gaidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said in a social media post early on Saturday that Russia was trying to destroy the city of Sievierodonetsk, with fighting taking place on the outskirts of the city. \"Shelling continues from morning to the evening and also throughout the night,\" Gaidai said in a video post on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nIn early hours on Saturday, air raid sirens were going off in much of Ukraine, including in the Kyiv capital region and the southern port of Odesa. Capturing Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, much of which make up Ukraine's industrial Donbas region, would allow Moscow to claim a victory after announcing last month that this was now its objective.\n\nDespite losing ground elsewhere in recent weeks, Russian forces have advanced on the Luhansk front. \"This will be the critical next few weeks of the conflict,\" said Mathieu Boulegue, an expert at London's Chatham House think tank. \"And it depends on how effective they are at conquering Sievierodonetsk and the lands across it.\"\n\nThe city of Sievierodonetsk and its twin Lysychansk across the Siverskiy Donets river form the eastern part of a Ukrainian-held pocket that Russia has been trying to overrun since mid-April after failing to capture Kyiv. Ukraine's general staff said on Saturday that Russian forces were preparing to try again to cross the river, after a previous attempt earlier this month led to one of the largest battles in the conflict so far.\n\nBATTLE FOR MARIUPOL The end of the Mariupol siege was an important symbolic moment for Russia, after a series of setbacks since the invasion began on Feb. 24, but it came at the cost of massive destruction.\n\nZelenskiy said the region had been \"completely destroyed\" by Russia and proposed a formal deal with the country's allies to secure Russian compensation for the damage its forces had caused. Natalia Zarytska, wife of an Azovstal fighter who surrendered, said she had not heard from him since a Telegram message exchange two days ago. She believed he was still alive.\n\n\"The situation is really hard and horrible and my husband is on the way from one hell to another hell, from Azovstal steel plant to a prison, to captivity,\" Zarytska said in Istanbul, where she and other relatives lobbied Turkey to help save the fighters. The Red Cross said it had registered hundreds of Ukrainians who surrendered at the plant as prisoners of war and Kyiv says it wants a prisoner swap. Moscow says the prisoners will be treated humanely, but Russian politicians have been quoted as saying some must be tried or even executed.\n\nRussian forces in Ukraine have been driven in recent weeks from the area surrounding Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, their fastest retreat since being forced out of the north and the Kyiv region at the end of March. But they still control a large swathe of the south and east, and the end of fighting in Mariupol means that that territory is now largely unbroken.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/13_05_2022_16_12_28_6514547.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 5, "stanza_neu": 22, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 28, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7048310798", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "11:28:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T11:28:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T10:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5882353186607361, "url": "https://ktbb.com/post/?p=1127845", "title": "Russia-Ukraine live updates: Russia fires top commanders over Ukraine war failures", "body": "(NEW YORK) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"special military operation\" into neighboring Ukraine began on Feb. 24, with Russian forces invading from Belarus, to the north, and Russia, to the east.

Russia claimed Thursday that 1,730 Ukrainian soldiers had surrendered in Mariupol over the previous three days, while Ukraine confirmed Tuesday that more than 250 had yielded in the initial hours after it ordered them to do so.\n\nMariupol is the largest city that Russian forces have seized since launching an invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24. Its complete capture gives Russia total control of the coast of the Sea of Azov as well as a continuous stretch of territory along eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\n\"Staunch Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol since the start of the war means Russian forces in the area must be re-equipped and refurbished before they can be redeployed effectively,\" the U.K. defense ministry said. \"This can be a lengthy process when done thoroughly.\"\n\n\"Russian commanders, however, are under pressure to demonstrably achieve operational objectives,\" the ministry added. \"This means that Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition.\"\n\nMay 20, 6:42 am\n\nBelarus says nearly 28,000 Ukrainians have arrived since Russian invasion\n\nNearly 28,000 Ukrainian citizens have arrived in Belarus since Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, according to the Belarusian State Border Committee.\n\n\"Between 6 a.m. on February 24 and 6 a.m. on May 20, a total of 27,868 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Belarus, including 15,793 who crossed the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, 10,563 by transit through Poland, 1,305 through Lithuania, and 207 through Latvia,\" the committee said in a statement Friday.\n\nIn the past 24 hours alone, 154 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Belarus, including 120 via Poland, according to the committee.\n\nBelarus shares a land border with both Ukraine and Russia, and is Moscow's main ally.\n\nMay 19, 8:07 pm\n\nBiden to sign Ukraine aid bill while abroad\n\nPresident Joe Biden will sign the $40 billion Ukraine aid bill while he's in Asia, a White House official said.\n\n\"The president does intend to sign the bill while he's on the road so that he can sign it expeditiously,\" national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One while en route to the region Thursday evening. \"The modalities of that are being worked right now so that he can get it and sign it.\"\n\nThe bill, which passed the Senate earlier Thursday with bipartisan support, will need to be flown to the region so that Biden can sign it.

It gives Russian President Vladimir Putin a rare victory after a series of setbacks in nearly three months of combat.\n\nThe last Ukrainian forces holed up Mariupol's vast Azovstal steelworks surrendered on Friday, Russia said.\n\nFull control of Mariupol gives Russia command of a land route linking the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014, with mainland Russia and areas of eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russia separatists.\n\nUkrainian forces in the separatist-controlled regions of Luhansk and Donetsk said on Saturday they had repelled nine attacks and destroyed five tanks and 10 other armored vehicles in the previous 24 hours.\n\nRussian forces were using aircraft, artillery, tanks, rockets, mortars and missiles along the entire front line to attack civilian structures and residential areas, the Ukrainians said in a Facebook post. At least seven people were killed in the Donetsk region, they said.\n\nRussian troops destroyed a bridge on the Siverskiy Donets River between Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nPOKROVSK, Ukraine (AP) -- The West moved to pour billions more in aid into Ukraine on Friday, as Russia shifted troops freed up by the imminent fall of the pulverized city of Mariupol and fighting raged in the country's industrial heartland in the east.\n\nRussian forces shelled a vital highway and kept up attacks on a key city in the Luhansk region, hitting a school among other sites, Ukrainian authorities said. Luhansk is part of the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking eastern expanse of coal mines and factories that Russian President Vladimir Putin is bent on capturing.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Russia said more than 1,900 had surrendered in recent days. Also remaining at the plant were the bodies of soldiers who defended it while tying down Russian forces.\n\nDenis Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, which led the defense of the plant, called them \"fallen heroes.\"\n\n\"I hope soon relatives and the whole of Ukraine will be able to bury the fighters with honors,\" he said.\n\nWives of fighters who held out at the steelworks spoke emotionally about what may have been their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\nMeanwhile, fighting intensified deeper in the Donbas.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces were especially focused on the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway, the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The road is extremely important because it's the only connection to other regions of the country,\" he said via email. \"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region.\"\n\nRussian forces shelled the road constantly from multiple directions, but Ukrainian armored transports were still able to get through, Haidai added.\n\nMoscow's troops have been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas. One of Friday's attacks was on a school in Severodonetsk that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, Haidai said. Three adults were killed, he said on Telegram.\n\nTwelve people were killed in Severodonetsk, Haidai said. It was not immediately clear if that included the three at the school. In addition, more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nRussian forces now control 90 percent of Luhansk, but the attack on Severodonetsk failed -- \"the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated,\" Haidai said. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nPro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas for the past eight years and held a considerable swath of it before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. But the effort by Putin's troops to take more territory there has been slow-going.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, Britain's Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian forces elsewhere in Ukraine continued to blast away at targets, some of them civilian.\n\nIn the village of Velyka Kostromka, west of the Donbas, explosions in the middle of the night Thursday shook Iryna Martsyniuk's house to its foundations. Roof timbers splintered and windows shattered, sending shards of glass into a wall near three sleeping children.\n\n\"There were flashes everywhere,\" she said. \"There was smoke everywhere.\" She grabbed the children and ran toward the home's entrance, \"but the corridor wasn't there anymore. Instead, we saw the starry night.\"\n\nThey ran down the road to a neighbor's home, where they hid in the basement.\n\nAround 20 other houses were damaged and two people were lightly wounded, said Olha Shaytanova, head of the village.\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

The Russian army was trying to attack the cities of Sloviansk and Sievierodonetsk, but Ukrainian forces were holding off their advance, he said.\n\nEarlier, Zelenskiy told local television that while the fighting would be bloody, the end would come only through diplomacy and that the Russian occupation of Ukrainian territory would be temporary.\n\nZelenskiy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak ruled out agreeing to a ceasefire and said Kyiv would not accept any deal with Moscow that involved ceding territory. He said making concessions would backfire on Ukraine because Russia would hit back harder after any break in fighting.\n\n\"The war will not stop (after concessions). It will just be put on pause for some time,\" Podolyak, Ukraine's lead negotiator, told Reuters in an interview in the heavily guarded presidential office.\n\n\"They'll start a new offensive, even more bloody and large-scale.\"\n\nRecent calls for an immediate ceasefire have come from U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.\n\nThe end of fighting in Mariupol, the biggest city Russia has captured, could be crucial to its ambitions in Donbas. It gives Russian President Vladimir Putin a rare victory after a series of setbacks in nearly three months of combat.\n\nThe last Ukrainian forces holed up Mariupol's vast Azovstal steelworks surrendered on Friday, Russia said.\n\nFull control of Mariupol gives Russia command of a land route linking the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014, with mainland Russia and areas of eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russia separatists.\n\nUkrainian forces in the separatist-controlled regions of Luhansk and Donetsk said on Saturday they had repelled nine attacks and destroyed five tanks and 10 other armored vehicles in the previous 24 hours.\n\nRussian forces were using aircraft, artillery, tanks, rockets, mortars and missiles along the entire front line to attack civilian structures and residential areas, the Ukrainians said in a Facebook post. At least seven people were killed in the Donetsk region, they said.\n\nRussian troops destroyed a bridge on the Siverskiy Donets River between Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said. There was fighting on the outskirts of Sievierodonetsk from morning through the night, he said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nSievierodonetsk and its twin Lysychansk across the Siverskiy Donets River form the eastern part of a Ukrainian-held pocket that Russia has been trying to overrun since mid-April after failing to capture Kyiv.\n\nGAS DISPUTE\n\nRussia's state gas company, Gazprom, said it halted gas exports to Finland, which refused Moscow's demands to pay in roubles for Russian gas after Western countries imposed sanctions over the invasion.\n\nFinland and Sweden applied this week to join the NATO military alliance.\n\nFinnish state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum, the Finnish government and individual gas consuming companies in Finland have said they were prepared for a shutdown of Russian flows.\n\nMost European supply contracts are denominated in euros or dollars. Last month, Moscow cut off gas to Bulgaria and Poland after they refused to comply with the new terms.\n\nWestern nations also have stepped up weapons supplies to Ukraine. On Saturday, Kyiv got another huge boost when U.S. President Joe Biden signed a bill to provide nearly $40 billion in military, economic and humanitarian aid.\n\nMoscow says Western sanctions, along with arms deliveries for Kyiv, amount to a \"proxy war\" by the United States and its allies.\n\nThe Russian military said it had destroyed a major consignment of Western arms in Ukraine's Zhytomyr region, west of Kyiv, using sea-launched Kalibr cruise missiles.

You can see what home comforts that we have,\" said Kateryna Talpa, 35, pointing to mattresses and sheets on the ground, and some food in a cardboard box.\n\nShe and her husband Yuriy are doing their best to cope in the Soviet-era station called \"Heroes of Labour\", alongside their cats Marek and Sima.\n\n\"They got used to it,\" Talpa said.\n\nIn the town of Lozova, at least eight people, including a child, were wounded Friday when a powerful Russian missile strike gutted a newly repaired cultural centre, the largest in the region.\n\nKharkiv regional governor Oleg Sinegubov said all eight had been struck by shrapnel after three Russian missiles had been fired towards the 1,000-capacity building.", "source": {"uri": "daily-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daily_sun@daily-sun.com", "name": "Daily Sun", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.daily-sun.com/assets/importent_images/common-pic-large.png", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 9, "stanza_neu": 26, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 36, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7050310734", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-22", "time": "09:28:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-22T09:28:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-22T09:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5882353186607361, "url": "https://mooresvilletribune.com/news/national/explainer-who-were-mariupols-last-defenders/article_7a37cf0a-e65b-596e-b69b-0ecb91dc350a.html", "title": "EXPLAINER: Who were Mariupol's last defenders?", "body": "The Associated Press\n\nThe Ukrainian forces who made a determined last stand in a Mariupol steel mill against Russian troops were a mixture of seasoned soldiers, border guards, a controversial national guard regiment and volunteers who took up arms in the weeks before Russia's invasion.\n\nAs Russia announced it had completed its takeover of Mariupol with the surrender of the fighters who served as the final obstacle, Ukraine's government did not confirm the city's fall. Earlier in the week, Ukrainian officials said its combantants in the Azovstal steel plant had completed their mission and were being evacuated, describing them as heroes who had fulfilled a grueling task.\n\nHere's a look at these Ukrainian forces, who were taken prisoner by the Russians as they left the plant, and what they accomplished:\n\nPeople are also reading...

Border guards, police officers, and territorial defense squads formed shortly before the war supplemented their ranks.\n\nThe bulk of these forces were deployed to defend Mariupol, home to a stategically located port, at the start of the Russian invasion. Marines from the 36th brigade held the port and another large plant in Mariupol for more than a month, until they ran out of supplies and ammunition.\n\nThey moved to the Azovstal steel mill to join the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right, and some of them were captured by the Russians.\n\nWHY DOES RUSSIA LABEL THEM 'NATIONALISTS'?\n\nIn announcing Azovstal's seizure, the Russian Defense Ministry's chief spokesman referred to the Azov Regiment's fighters as Nazis and said their commander was taken away in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred of him \"for numerous atrocities.\"\n\nNo evidence has surfaced of the regiment mistreating Ukrainian civilians, hundreds of whom sheltered underground with the fighters. The regiment released several videos taken inside Azovstal that showed their members interacting with the civilians and giving children sweets.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly made negative assertions about the Azov Regiment.\n\nThe National Guard unit grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that rose to bolster Ukraine's underfunded and questionably led military in the fight against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThat conflict broke out after massive protests drove Ukraine's Kremlin-leaning president from office.\n\nThe Azov Battalion drew its initial fighters from far-right circles and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. Its current members rejected accusations of nationalism and radicalism. Sviatoslav Palamar, the regiment's deputy commander, said in a recent interview from the steel mill that he preferred the term \"patriotism.\"\n\nWHAT DID THE DEFENDERS ACCOMPLISH?\n\nAs Mariupol became a symbol of the suffering and resistance of Ukrainians after Russia invaded their country, Ukrainian officials repeatedly stressed the role the fighters at Azovstal played in defending the city and stymying Russian progress elsewhere.\n\n\"The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol have already performed a feat, drawing the elite forces of the Russian army onto themselves and significantly slowing down the advance of the Russians in the southeast,\" Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said.\n\nAfter the plant's defenders were instructed to end their fight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the move was proper and humane because \"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle.\"\n\nThe ruined seaside city and the outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian fighters whose persistence frustrated Russia's objective to capture Mariupol quickly are now irrevocably etched into Ukrainian history, regardless of the outcome of the war.\n\nThe defense of Mariupol \"will go down in history as Thermopylae of the 21st century,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's president, said as the fighters started leaving the plant. \"The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy's plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war.\"\n\nThermopylae is widely considered one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing. They were killed to a man, including their king.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Here's where things stand - KION546", "body": "It is nearly three months since Russia invaded Ukraine -- a 12-week period in which Russian forces have wrought devastation on the country and its people, resulting in death on a vast scale and causing millions to flee.\n\nBut the invasion has not been the military success Moscow hoped, and is now deep into its second phase.\n\nThe bulk of fighting has moved to the east, after failed Russian advances in central Ukraine. The defenders are even focusing on retaking some key areas nearer the Russian border, while Moscow is seeing its troops beaten back in a few key battles.\n\nWestern aid is also flowing into Ukraine, NATO is set to be strengthened as countries seek to join, and the first Russian soldier accused of war crimes has stood trial.\n\nHere's what has happened in several key areas since the war began.\n\nAfter weeks of intense fighting, Ukraine's eastern Donbas region is \"completely destroyed,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday.\n\nHe accused Russia of a \"deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible\" after a village in Chernihiv was hit with missiles, leaving many dead.\n\nOfficials in the region say the front line is being shelled \"day and night,\" with Russian forces attempting to break through Ukrainian lines.\n\nA NATO military official told CNN Wednesday that the alliance expects something of a stalemate over the next few weeks. But the official said NATO believes momentum has shifted significantly in favor of Ukraine and the debate within NATO circles is now over whether it is possible for Kyiv to retake Crimea and the Donbas territories seized by Russia and Russian-backed separatists, respectively, in 2014.\n\nUkrainian forces have beaten back Russia's assaults in Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv, and advanced toward the border in several places north and east of the city.\n\nUkrainian officials said last week they were liberating villages on the outskirts of the city. Their advances led to the symbolic and embarrassing expulsion of the Kremlin's forces back to their own border while posing the strategic threat of cutting Russia's supply lines into Ukraine and its forces further south in Donbas.\n\nAnastasia Paraskevova recently returned to her home in Kharkiv for the first time since fleeing the city two months ago. It had been under constant bombardment since then, until Russian forces were repelled.\n\nParaskevova said overall the experience was good. \"The city was much more alive. People were walking the streets. And some shops were working. It felt like some life was back, much better than it was when I was here in March.\"\n\nEvery day, hundreds, or even thousands, of people are trying to flee the Russian-occupied region of Kherson in southern Ukraine.\n\nThe city has been under Russian control since early in the invasion. Ukrainians are leaving for many reasons: to avoid being detained or to escape the heavy-handed actions of Russian forces, or because of the chronic shortages of medicine and other basics in Kherson, which fell under Russian control soon after the invasion.\n\nLast week, a convoy of about 1,000 vehicles tried to leave Kherson. The Russians ultimately let the convoy move in batches -- but only after holding it in one place for most of the day.\n\nMariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, finally fell to Russian forces after weeks of relentless bombardment.\n\nThe city was the scene of some of the most intense fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. It was there that Russia carried out deadly strikes on a maternity ward and the bombing of a theater where hundreds of civilians had sought refuge from the violence.\n\nMariupol became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance as its defenders held out at Azovstal, a sprawling steelworks plant where as many as 1,000 civilians had taken shelter at one point, with stocks of food and water dwindling.\n\nUkraine's military announced late Monday that its forces had completed their \"combat mission\" at Azovstal, effectively ceding the city to Russian forces. On Friday, Ukraine ordered its forces to stop defending the plant.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Friday that almost 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers have surrendered at Azovstal. CNN cannot independently verify that figure.\n\nWith the city now almost fully under Russian control, there is concern that evidence of any potential war crimes -- like those allegedly committed in Bucha and Borodianka -- could be lost or destroyed.\n\nMore evidence of potential Russian war crimes is emerging in Bucha, the northern Ukrainian city near Kyiv, the capital. An investigation by The New York Times alleged that Russian paratroopers carried out summary executions of at least eight Ukrainian men in Bucha on March 4.\n\nEvidence of mass graves and civilian executions in the towns of Bucha and Borodianka has continued to emerge since early April, following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Kyiv region.\n\nImages of bodies lying strewn the streets of Bucha have sparked international condemnation and fueled calls for an investigation into potential Russian war crimes.\n\nCNN visited the scene of mass graves in Bucha in April after Russian forces had withdrawn, revealing the horrors of their occupation to the world. Correspondent Fred Pleitgen was among the first to reach a mass grave that residents dug while the place was under Russian occupation, because so many residents had been killed and longer burial ceremonies would have been too dangerous amid the shooting and shelling.\n\nThis week saw the start of the first war crimes trial in Ukraine since the invasion began. A 21-year-old Russian soldier named Vadim Shishimarin pleaded guilty to killing an unarmed 62-year-old man.\n\nThe trial's first day was so packed with journalists that authorities in Kyiv were forced to move to bigger venue. It has since produced several dramatic moments, including a confrontation between the soldier and the victim's widow and testimony from Shishimarin himself.\n\nSpeaking Friday, Shishimarin acknowledged he was responsible for the killing but was \"sorry and sincerely repents.\"\n\n\"I was nervous the moment it happened. I didn't want to kill. But it happened and I do not deny it,\" he said.\n\nShishimarin's lawyer, Viktor Ovsyannikov, argued that while his client was guilty of killing, it was not murder.\n\n\"Shishimarin was in a state of stress caused by the combat situation and the pressure from his commander. Analysis of those circumstances allows me to conclude that Shishimarin had no direct intent for the murder,\" Ovsyannikov said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that Russia has no details about Shishimarin's case and it considers the charges \"unacceptable,\" \"outrageous\" and \"staged.\"\n\nForeign diplomatic missions started coming back to life in Kyiv this week, after diplomats fled the city en masse at the beginning of the conflict.\n\nThe US flag was raised over the United States Embassy to mark the official resumption operations on Wednesday, while the Swiss Foreign Ministry said Thursday it would also reopen its embassy.\n\nUS lawmakers passed a bill Thursday that will send roughly $40 billion to Ukraine to pay for military and humanitarian aid, including funding that will assist Ukrainian military and national security forces, help replenish stores of US equipment sent to Ukraine and provide public health and medical support for Ukrainian refugees.\n\nUS President Joseph Biden signed the aid package while he was in South Korea.\n\nHelsinki and Stockholm had, for decades, avoided joining the alliance, but cited Moscow's invasion as the ultimate impetus to do so now. The two countries formally handed in their applications Wednesday.\n\nMost NATO members appear ready to support both bids, except for Turkey.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday that his country \"will say no to Sweden's and Finland's entry into NATO,\" citing their support for the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The PKK seeks an independent state in Turkey and has been in an armed struggle with Ankara for decades. It has been designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.\n\nSome experts say Erdogan may be angling for concessions or to highlight grievances Turkey wishes to bring to the attention of the international community.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

It achieved a major step towards that goal this week, when Ukraine ordered its garrison in the main Donbas port, Mariupol, to stand down after a near three-month siege.\n\nRussia's Shoigu said around 2 000 Ukrainian fighters had surrendered in the past four days.\n\nKyiv has not confirmed how many fighters have surrendered, but Britain gave the first official Western confirmation that a large Ukrainian force had laid down arms in the plant, estimating the number at around 1 700. An unknown number were still believed to be inside, it said.\n\nIn a video, the commander of the Azov Battalion, a Ukrainian unit that had defended the plant, confirmed the order to stop fighting was being carried out, and said all civilians and wounded fighters were now out.\n\nDenys Prokopenko, the commander, gave no details of the fate of other fighters, but said a process was under way to remove the dead from underground tunnels and bunkers.\n\n\"I hope that in the near future, relatives and Ukraine will be able to bury their soldiers with honour,\" Prokopenko said.\n\nThe Red Cross says it has registered hundreds of Ukrainians who surrendered as prisoners of war, but has given no firm numbers.\n\nKyiv says it wants to arrange a prisoner swap for Azovstal defenders it describes as heroes. Moscow says they will be treated humanely, but Russian politicians have been quoted as saying some must be tried for crimes and even executed.\n\nFOOD AS HOSTAGE\n\nThe past week has seen Sweden and Finland apply to join NATO, the biggest shakeup in European security for decades, although Turkey has said it will block the move, accusing the Nordic countries of harbouring Kurdish militants.\n\nAfter weeks of threatening to retaliate, Putin appears to have mostly climbed down, saying this week that NATO membership for Finland and Sweden did not represent a threat as such, unless the alliance sends new weapons or troops. Nevertheless, Defence Minister Shoigu said on Friday Moscow planned to beef up its forces nearby in response to what he called new threats.\n\nRussian forces in Ukraine have been driven in recent weeks out of the area around Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv, their fastest retreat since being forced out of the north and the area around Kyiv at the end of March.\n\nBut they still control a large swathe of the south and east, and the end of fighting in Mariupol means that territory is now largely unbroken. Ukraine says Russia is trying to impose its own administration and could try to annex occupied territory, possibly by staging fake votes.\n\nStill, military analysts say Russia has been using up its firepower against an underestimated foe, and may be running out of time to achieve its aim of capturing the whole Donbas.\n\n\"Nothing is set yet. But it will be very much the next phase ... before the Kremlin must freeze positions on the ground and stop advancing and shift to positional warfare,\" said Boulegue, the Chatham House expert.\n\nIn a sign of Russia's aim to boost its war effort, the parliament in Moscow said it would consider a bill to allow Russians over 40 and foreigners over 30 to sign up for the military. Putin has stopped short of declaring his \"special military operation\" to be a war, which would make it easier to mobilise reservists and conscripts.", "source": {"uri": "sabcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SABC News - Breaking news, special reports, world, business, sport coverage of all South African current events.

New countries will attend the second, which will be strictly virtual, Kirby said.\n\n\"There are some countries that have shown an interest in participating that weren't in the first meeting,\" said Kirby, who called the first iteration \"a true global community\" of countries in NATO and beyond.\n\nMay 20, 3:41 pm\n\nRussian Ministry of Defense claims it has taken complete control over Azovstal steel plant, Mariupol\n\nRussia's Ministry of Defense claimed Friday it has taken complete control of the Azovstal plant and Mariupol from the Ukrainian forces, expelling them from the port city.\n\nThe underground facilities of the plant, in which the Azov National Regiment militia were hiding, came under the complete control of Russian forces, the ministry claimed.\n\nThe commander of the Azov Regiment was reportedly taken out of the territory of the plant in an armored car, the ministry said.\n\nRussia claims 2,439 Ukrainian servicemen have laid down their arms and surrendered since May 16.\n\nMay 20, 1:10 pm\n\nRussia to cut off Finland's natural gas Saturday morning\n\nGasum, Finland's natural gas company, announced Friday that it was informed its imports from Russia's Gazprom Export will be cut off on Saturday at 7 a.m. local time.\n\nThe move by Russia comes days after Finland submitted its application to join NATO.\n\n\"It is highly regrettable that natural gas supplies under our supply contract will now be halted. However, we have been carefully preparing for this situation and provided that there will be no disruptions in the gas transmission network, we will be able to supply all our customers with gas in the coming months,\" Gasum CEO Mika Wiljanen said in a statement.\n\nGasum will supply natural gas to its customers from other sources though the Balticconnector pipeline, which connects Finland with Estonia, the company said in a statement.\n\nGasum said its gas-filling stations in the network area will continue in normal operation.\n\nMay 20, 8:57 am\n\nUS-supplied howitzers to Ukraine lack accuracy-aiding computers\n\nDozens of artillery systems supplied by the United States to Ukraine were not fitted with advanced computer systems, which improve the efficiency and accuracy of the weapons, ABC News has learned.\n\nThe M777 155mm howitzers are now being used by the Ukrainian military in its war with Russia.\n\nThe Pentagon did not deny that the artillery pieces were supplied without the computers but said it had received \"positive feedback\" from the Ukrainians about the \"precise and highly effective\" weapons.\n\nThat positive sentiment was echoed by a Ukrainian politician, who spoke to ABC News on condition of anonymity. However, the politician also expressed frustration that the artillery pieces had not been the fitted with the digital computer systems.\n\nArtillery is currently playing a crucial role in the fighting across eastern Ukraine, as Russia continues its offensive in that part of the country. U.S. officials recently confirmed that all but one of the 90 howitzers promised to Ukraine had now been delivered, along with tactical vehicles used to tow them.\n\nIf fitted to a howitzer, the digital computer system enables the crew operating the weapon to quickly and accurately pinpoint a target. Howitzers without a computer system can still be fired accurately, using traditional methods to calculate the angle needed to hit a target.\n\nModern computer systems, however, rule out the possibility of human error. Why the artillery pieces supplied to Ukraine did not have the digital targeting technology installed is unclear. The Pentagon said it would not discuss individual components \"for operational security reasons.\"\n\n-ABC News' Tom Burridge and Luis Martinez\n\nMay 20, 6:58 am\n\n1,700 Ukrainian soldiers likely surrendered from Mariupol plant, UK says\n\nAs many as 1,700 Ukrainian soldiers have likely surrendered from the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works plant in war-ravaged Mariupol this week, according to the U.K. Ministry of Defense.\n\n\"An unknown number of Ukrainian forces remain inside the factory,\" the ministry said Friday in an intelligence update. \"Once Russia has secured Mariupol, it is likely they will move their forces to reinforce operations in the Donbas.\"\n\nFor weeks, Ukrainian fighters and civilians were holed up inside the sprawling industrial site as the remaining pocket of resistance to Russia's relentless bombardment of Mariupol, a southeastern Ukrainian port city strategically located on the Sea of Azov between eastern Ukraine's disputed Donbas region and the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula. Russia claimed Thursday that 1,730 Ukrainian soldiers had surrendered in Mariupol over the previous three days, while Ukraine confirmed Tuesday that more than 250 had yielded in the initial hours after it ordered them to do so.\n\nMariupol is the largest city that Russian forces have seized since launching an invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24. Its complete capture gives Russia total control of the coast of the Sea of Azov as well as a continuous stretch of territory along eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\n\"Staunch Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol since the start of the war means Russian forces in the area must be re-equipped and refurbished before they can be redeployed effectively,\" the U.K. defense ministry said. \"This can be a lengthy process when done thoroughly.\"\n\n\"Russian commanders, however, are under pressure to demonstrably achieve operational objectives,\" the ministry added. \"This means that Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition.\"\n\nMay 20, 6:42 am\n\nBelarus says nearly 28,000 Ukrainians have arrived since Russian invasion\n\nNearly 28,000 Ukrainian citizens have arrived in Belarus since Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, according to the Belarusian State Border Committee.\n\n\"Between 6 a.m. on February 24 and 6 a.m. on May 20, a total of 27,868 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Belarus, including 15,793 who crossed the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, 10,563 by transit through Poland, 1,305 through Lithuania, and 207 through Latvia,\" the committee said in a statement Friday.\n\nIn the past 24 hours alone, 154 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Belarus, including 120 via Poland, according to the committee.\n\nBelarus shares a land border with both Ukraine and Russia, and is Moscow's main ally.\n\nMay 19, 8:07 pm\n\nBiden to sign Ukraine aid bill while abroad\n\nPresident Joe Biden will sign the $40 billion Ukraine aid bill while he's in Asia, a White House official said.\n\n\"The president does intend to sign the bill while he's on the road so that he can sign it expeditiously,\" national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One while en route to the region Thursday evening. \"The modalities of that are being worked right now so that he can get it and sign it.\"\n\nThe bill, which passed the Senate earlier Thursday with bipartisan support, will need to be flown to the region so that Biden can sign it.

Most of the Ukrainian fighters have left the Azovstal steel plant after almost three months of resistance.\n\nThis was a record in Russia's war against Ukraine, which began with the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Only the airport in Donetsk was defended for even longer in 2014 and 2015. But the situation in Mariupol was much worse because Ukraine could not provide military aid to the besieged.\n\nSome Ukrainian fighters walked out of the bunkers under the steel plant; some had to be taken out on stretchers, others preferred to be the last to leave.\n\nThe hope among those who have chosen captivity is that they be exchanged for Russian soldiers captured by the Ukrainian army. Whether that hope is justified is hard to predict. Russia seems to be in no hurry and is using the Ukrainian prisoners of war for humiliating propaganda purposes.\n\nMariupol, on the shore of the Sea of Azov, is a household name today. It will feature prominently in the history books about Russia's brutal war of extermination against Ukraine.\n\nIt's the first major Ukrainian city to be completely destroyed by the Russian army without regard for civilian casualties. It was quickly encircled, but resisted, becoming a model of Ukraine's will to assert itself.\n\nThe exact death toll in the city, which was home to about half a million people before the war, is still unknown, but it is feared it could be in the tens of thousands. After weeks of incessant shelling, barely a single residential building remains intact. This is without doubt a war crime.\n\nFrom the first day of the war, Mariupol was one of the three cities fought over most fiercely, along with Kharkiv and Kyiv.\n\nIt was targeted first and foremost because of its strategic importance. Mariupol is the second most important industrial center in the Donbas after Donetsk and an important commercial port.\n\nIn the spring of 2014, it suffered the same fate that befell Donetsk and Luhansk and was occupied by pro-Russian separatists for a few weeks but was quickly liberated by the Ukrainian army. Since then, the front line has run a few kilometers away from the city. The two local industrial giants, Azov Steel and Illich Steel and Iron Works, were able to continue their production.\n\nFor eight years, the residents of Mariupol lived on a powder keg. But with the exception of an attack in January 2015 that killed more than 30 people, the city was spared any further casualties or destruction.\n\nDuring this time, Mariupol became a center of the Russian-speaking but Ukrainian-minded Donbas. The blue and yellow flags were a thorn in the side of those who wanted to see Mariupol as part of the regions occupied by Russia with the help of separatists. This is also why the Russian forces have acted so cruelly and brutally there.\n\nMoreover, the location of Mariupol, which is on the land bridge from Russia to the annexed Crimea peninsula, plays a crucial role. The creation of such a land connection is one of Russia's main goals in this war.\n\nFinally, another important factor is the fact that the headquarters of the Azov Regiment, founded by radical nationalists, was located in Mariupol. Those fighters had played a decisive role in the liberation of the city in 2014. The very existence of the Azov Regiment, a small but well-armed unit of the Ukrainian National Guard, has been a central theme of Russian propaganda for years. Ever since Russia declared \"denazification\" an official wartime goal, the Kremlin has sought to destroy all those it labels \"Nazis.\"\n\nThe price Mariupol had to pay for all this is outrageous. Mariupol now ranks among the cities almost completely destroyed by war. The battle for Mariupol will be remembered for the shocking shelling of the maternity hospital, from which bloodied mothers were carried out, and for the bombing of the theater where civilians had sought shelter but perished. These images will not be forgotten. Mariupol has become a city of Russian shame.\n\nBut Russian occupation does not herald the end of the city's Ukrainian history of the city. Just as the Azov steel plant will produce again, so the Ukrainian flag will fly there again.\n\nThe darkest chapter in the city's history will only be closed when the war criminals are brought to justice.

The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out in the plant, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon its defense and save their lives.\n\n'Under cover of darkness': The inside story of how the Rams worked the NFL and ditched St. Louis Editorial: The day could be approaching when Supreme Court rulings are openly defied Ladue graduate among leaders who fought for equal pay for US women's soccer players 'He was gone': 32 years after teen vanished, St. Louis police tap genetic forensics to solve case Augusta winery investor steps down, taps sons to lead $100M plan Wainwright-Molina battery is supercharged: Pujols allows four runs in ninth in 15-6 Cardinals romp Missing man who fell from canoe had no life jacket, clung to seat cushion on Missouri River Two dead in south St. Louis County after fatal shooting blamed on domestic altercation Hummel: What does the future hold for DeJong, Dickerson and Reyes?

Luhansk is part of the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin had sought control of Mariupol to complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the larger battle for control of the Donbas. The city's loss also deprives Ukraine of a vital seaport.\n\nThe city endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained from a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left behind rows and rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place.\n\nA week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600. Officials had written the word \"CHILDREN\" in Russian on the pavement outside to try to forestall an aerial attack.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians. The imagery showed rows of graves stretching away from an existing cemetery.\n\nMariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko accused the Russians of \"hiding their military crimes\" in the mass graves and labeled it \"the new Babi Yar\" -- recalling the ravine in Kyiv where the Nazis massacred nearly 34,000 Ukrainian Jews during World War II.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Monday that the evacuation of his forces from the bunkers and tunnels beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters.\n\n\"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe Azovstal complex covers 11 square kilometers (4 square miles) and is threaded with about 24 kilometers (15 miles) of tunnels and bunkers. Earlier in May, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires.\n\nOne civilian evacuee from Azovstal, who made it to the Ukrainian controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on May 3, said she went to sleep at the plant every night afraid she wouldn't wake up.\n\n\"You can't imagine how scary it is when you sit in the bomb shelter, in a damp and wet basement, and it is bouncing and shaking,\" said Elina Tsybulchenko, 54.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks spoke emotionally about what may have been their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\"\n\nNatalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\"\n\nShe said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- The Group of Seven major economies and global financial institutions agreed to provide more money to bolster Ukraine's finances, bringing the total to $19.8 billion. In the U.S., President Joe Biden was expected to sign a $40 billion package of military and economic aid to Ukraine and its allies.\n\n-- Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday, the Finnish state energy company said, just days after Finland applied to join NATO. Finland had refused Moscow's demand that it pay for gas in rubles. The cutoff is not expected to have any major immediate effect. Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland's total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said.\n\n-- A captured Russian soldier accused of killing a civilian awaited his fate in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, could get life in prison.\n\n-- Russian lawmakers proposed a bill to lift the age limit of 40 for Russians volunteering for military service. Currently, all Russian men 18 to 27 must undergo a year of service, though many get college deferments and other exemptions.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported Friday in the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking expanse of coal mines and factories.\n\n\"The liberation of the Luhansk People's Republic is nearing completion,\" Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu declared, referring to the breakaway state proclaimed by pro-Moscow separatists in 2014 and recognized by the Kremlin.\n\nSerhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces were especially focused on the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway, the only road for evacuating people and delivering humanitarian supplies.\n\n\"The road is extremely important because it's the only connection to other regions of the country,\" he said via email. \"The Russians are trying to cut us off from it, to encircle the Luhansk region.\"\n\nRussian forces shelled the road constantly from multiple directions, but Ukrainian armored transports were still able to get through, Haidai added.\n\nMoscow's troops have been trying for weeks to seize Severodonetsk, a key city in the Donbas. One of Friday's attacks was on a school in Severodonetsk that was sheltering more than 200 people, many of them children, Haidai said. Three adults were killed, he said on Telegram.\n\nTwelve people were killed in Severodonetsk, Haidai said. It was not immediately clear if that included the three at the school. In addition, more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, he added.\n\nRussian forces now control 90 percent of Luhansk, but the attack on Severodonetsk failed -- \"the Russians suffered personnel losses and retreated,\" Haidai said. His account could not be independently verified.\n\nAnother city, Rubizhne, has been \"completely destroyed,\" Haidai said. \"Its fate can be compared to that of Mariupol.\"\n\nMcQuillan reported from Lviv.

The White House is working to put advanced anti-ship missiles in the hands of Ukrainian fighters to help defeat Russia's naval blockade, officials said.\n\nAnd in a further sign of Western action hurting the Russian economy, five foreign vice-presidents of Russia's Rosneft have resigned because of EU sanctions forbidding European citizens or Russians living in the EU to work at the oil company, sources said.\n\nThe EU said it is looking into ways of using the frozen assets of Russian oligarchs to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, while the United States has not ruled out possibly placing sanctions on countries that purchase Russian oil.\n\nNATO DIVISION\n\nBut Western divisions have also been on show with NATO member Turkey opposed to Sweden and Finland joining the alliance, a move that would reverse generations of military non-alignment in the biggest European security shake-up in decades.\n\nAnkara accuses the two Nordic states of harbouring Kurdish militants, but U.S. President Joe Biden and European leaders said they were confident Turkey's concerns could be addressed.\n\nBiden, hosting Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson and Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 at the White House, told reporters: \"I think we're going to be OK.\"\n\nNiinisto said Finland would commit to Turkey's security, adding, \"We condemn terrorism in all its forms and we are actively engaged in combating it.\"\n\nIn Mariupol, the ultimate outcome of the bloodiest battle in Europe for decades has remained unclear, with uncertainty over the fate of hundreds of Ukrainian defenders.\n\nMoscow said on Thursday that 1,730 Ukrainian fighters had surrendered so far, including 771 in the past 24 hours.\n\nUkrainian officials, who have sought a prisoner swap, had declined to comment, saying it could endanger rescue efforts.\n\nLate on Thursday, Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy head of the Azov Regiment defending the steelworks, released an 18-second video in which he said he and other commanders were still on the territory of the plant.\n\n\"A certain operation is going on, the details of which I will not disclose,\" he said.\n\nThe Switzerland-based International Committee of the Red Cross said it has registered hundreds of prisoners from the plant now held by Russia, but it has not given a precise number.\n\nThe leader of Russian-backed separatists in control of the area said nearly half of the fighters remained inside the steelworks, where underground bunkers and tunnels had protected them from weeks of Russian bombardment.\n\n\"More than half have laid down their arms,\" Denis Pushilin told the Solovyov Live internet television channel.\n\nThe wounded were given medical treatment while those who were fit were taken to a penal colony and were being treated well, he said.\n\nRussia denies it agreed to a prisoner swap.

He demanded Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the plant surrender, but they refused to do so for weeks.

We want everything to return [to as it was before] but Russia does not want that.\"\n\nThe Kremlin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, responded by blaming Ukraine for stopping the talks. The last discussions between the two sides took place on 22 April, according to Russian news agencies.\n\nDuring the interview, held with a Ukrainian broadcaster, Zelenskiy spoke of creating a document enshrining security guarantees for his country. Although bilateral discussions would be held with Russia, the document would be signed by \"friends and partners of Ukraine, without Moscow\", he added.\n\nHowever, he warned that the precondition for resuming negotiations was that Moscow did not kill Ukrainian troops who had been defending the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. \"The most important thing for me is to save the maximum number of people and soldiers,\" he said.\n\nLast week, Russia announced it had taken full control of Mariupol, the first major city to fall. The last group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the Azovstal steelworks surrendered on Friday, bringing to an end a months-long siege of the defenders' last stronghold.\n\n\"Underground structures of Azovstal where militants were hiding are now under full control of Russian armed forces,\" Russia's defence ministry said in a statement, adding that 2,439 Ukrainian fighters had surrendered.\n\nHours before the Russian announcement, Zelenskiy said the defenders had been told by commanders that they should leave. In a live video posted on the messaging service Telegram, Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment, which has led the defence of the factory, said only the dead remained.\n\n\"The higher military command has given the order to save the lives of the soldiers of our garrison and to stop defending the city,\" he said. \"I now hope that soon the families and all of Ukraine will be able to bury their fighters with honours.\"\n\nUkraine hopes to exchange the surrendering Azovstal soldiers for Russian prisoners. But in Donetsk, pro-Kremlin authorities are threatening to put some of them on trial.\n\nThe fall of Mariupol - the largest trading port on the Sea of Azov, from which Ukraine exports grain, iron, steel and heavy machinery - is a breakthrough for Russia. Taking control of the city means gaining a land corridor from the Donbas to Crimea.\n\nFierce fighting continued in the eastern Donbas, where Zelenskiy said Russian troops had \"completely ruined\" the cities of Rubizhne and Volnovakha, \"just as they did Mariupol\", adding that the Russians were \"trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities\".\n\nMeanwhile, on Saturday the Russian energy company Gazprom halted gas exports to neighbouring Finland, the Finnish gas system operator said, after Helsinki angered Moscow by applying for Nato membership last week.\n\nMoscow had warned Finland that any such application would be \"a grave mistake with far-reaching consequences\".\n\nThe majority of gas used in Finland comes from Russia, but the fuel only accounts for about 5% of the country's annual energy consumption.\n\nThe Finnish president, Sauli Niinist\u00f6, said he and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, had had \"open and direct\" talks to discuss the bid for Nato membership, after Erdo\u011fan openly questioned whether Finland and Sweden, which has also applied, should be permitted to join.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lorenzo_tondo@theguardian.com", "name": "Lorenzo Tondo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/261830be73246b484d0df6cd4d2ee6c9b3905003/0_48_2862_1718/master/2862.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=1fb7a15ece3ba312a9e3842fc0cbdcb0", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 8, "stanza_neu": 20, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 29, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049281639", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "07:20:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T07:20:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T07:10:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5803921818733215, "url": "https://www.newtelegraphng.com/ukraine-conflict-russia-declares-victory-at-mariupol-steelworks/", "title": "Ukraine Conflict: Russia declares victory at Mariupol steelworks - New Telegraph", "body": "Russia has declared victory in its months-long battle to conquer the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol.\n\nThe last fighters defending the city's Azovstal steel plant have now surrendered, Moscow officials said.\n\nFor months the troops had been holed up in the huge complex, preventing Russia from establishing complete control over the city, reports the BBC.\n\nFriday's evacuation marks the end of the most destructive siege of the war, with Mariupol now in complete ruins.\n\nThe city and its steel plant are now \"completely liberated\" after 531 Ukrainian troops left the site, the Russian defence ministry said.\n\n\"The underground facilities of the enterprise, where the militants were hiding, came under the full control of the Russian armed forces,\" it added in a statement.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the site's last remaining defenders had been given permission to leave.\n\n\"Today the boys received a clear signal from the military command that they can get out and save their lives,\" he told a Ukrainian television channel earlier on Friday.\n\nFor weeks the Azovstal site had been completely encircled.\n\nRussian forces blocked all humanitarian aid from entering, bombarded the site from the air and demanded its remaining defenders put down their weapons.\n\nMany of those trapped inside were civilians, including women, children and elderly people.

Border guards, police officers, and territorial defense squads formed shortly before the war supplemented their ranks.\n\nThe bulk of these forces were deployed to defend Mariupol, home to a stategically located port, at the start of the Russian invasion. Marines from the 36th brigade held the port and another large plant in Mariupol for more than a month, until they ran out of supplies and ammunition.\n\nThey moved to the Azovstal steel mill to join the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right, and some of them were captured by the Russians.\n\nWHY DOES RUSSIA LABEL THEM 'NATIONALISTS'?\n\nIn announcing Azovstal's seizure, the Russian Defense Ministry's chief spokesman referred to the Azov Regiment's fighters as Nazis and said their commander was taken away in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred of him \"for numerous atrocities.\"\n\nNo evidence has surfaced of the regiment mistreating Ukrainian civilians, hundreds of whom sheltered underground with the fighters. The regiment released several videos taken inside Azovstal that showed their members interacting with the civilians and giving children sweets.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly made negative assertions about the Azov Regiment.\n\nThe National Guard unit grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that rose to bolster Ukraine's underfunded and questionably led military in the fight against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThat conflict broke out after massive protests drove Ukraine's Kremlin-leaning president from office.\n\nThe Azov Battalion drew its initial fighters from far-right circles and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. Its current members rejected accusations of nationalism and radicalism. Sviatoslav Palamar, the regiment's deputy commander, said in a recent interview from the steel mill that he preferred the term \"patriotism.\"\n\nWHAT DID THE DEFENDERS ACCOMPLISH?\n\nAs Mariupol became a symbol of the suffering and resistance of Ukrainians after Russia invaded their country, Ukrainian officials repeatedly stressed the role the fighters at Azovstal played in defending the city and stymying Russian progress elsewhere.\n\n\"The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol have already performed a feat, drawing the elite forces of the Russian army onto themselves and significantly slowing down the advance of the Russians in the southeast,\" Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said.\n\nAfter the plant's defenders were instructed to end their fight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the move was proper and humane because \"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle.\"\n\nThe ruined seaside city and the outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian fighters whose persistence frustrated Russia's objective to capture Mariupol quickly are now irrevocably etched into Ukrainian history, regardless of the outcome of the war.\n\nThe defense of Mariupol \"will go down in history as Thermopylae of the 21st century,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's president, said as the fighters started leaving the plant. \"The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy's plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war.\"\n\nThermopylae is widely considered one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing. They were killed to a man, including their king.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Red Cross has been collecting personnel information from those individuals as part of efforts to formally register them as prisoners of war in the hopes that this will help prevent them from being subjected to any injustices while in Russian detention.\n\nThis is all part of a deal between the Russian and Ukrainian governments that was mediated, at least in part, by the Red Cross and the United Nations. Ukrainian officials have said that they are hoping to secure the freedom of those who have surrendered through a prisoner swap. However, their Russian counterparts now appear to be pushing back on the idea that such a swap was inevitable, raising questions about what might happen to the members of Ukraine's security forces and volunteers who are now in custody.\n\nHow many Ukrainians remain within the cavernous Azovstal complex is unclear. At the time of writing, the Russian military does not appear to have claimed to have fully secured the facility, which would finally put it in total control of Mariupol. Seizing the port city has been a key operational objective from the beginning, given its strategic location along an overland route between Russia and the occupied Crimean Peninsula. Completely defeating the defiant defenders who had been holding out at Azovstal will offer an important propaganda victory, too.\n\nWhat increasingly appears to be the now-inevitable fall of Mariupol comes amid reports that the Russian military has been sacking officers, including generals and admirals, over poor performance in the course of the conflict so far. Russian advances continue to be more or less stalled elsewhere in Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces continuing to capitalize on that and seize the initiative. The U.S. government, among others, has been increasingly pointing to the likelihood of the conflict dragging out for a prolonged period, if it does not outright reach a stalemate situation.\n\nWARNING: Some of the updates below contain graphic material.\n\nBefore diving into the last news below, The War Zone readers can first get up to speed on how the conflict in Ukraine has progressed already with our preceding rolling coverage here.\n\nPOSTED: X:XX PM EST --\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said earlier today that 771 Ukrainian personnel from Azovstal had surrendered in the preceding 24 hours, bringing the total number of individuals who have left the complex and are now in detention to 1,730. Those figures have not been independently confirmed, despite the Red Cross's efforts to register them. Authorities in Russia announced the first surrenders on Monday as part of what Ukrainian officials later confirmed was an agreed-upon plan to end the siege of Mariupol.\n\nSeriously wounded Ukrainian personnel are reportedly being sent to a military hospital in Novoazovsk, while others are now being held at the site of a former penal colony in Olenivka. Both of these locations are in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, also known as the DNR, a breakaway area in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. The Russian government recognized the DNR, as well as the separatist Luhansk People's Republic, or LNR, as independent countries in the immediate run-up to the all-out invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nWhat will happen now to surrendered Ukrainian forces, especially members of the controversial far-right Azov Regiment, which includes members who openly espouse neo-Nazi ideology, remains to be seen. Those who surrender in Mariupol will be treated \"consistent with the respective international laws,\" Dmitry Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin's top spokesperson, said today. However, there are growing calls from Russian politicians and separatist figures to put at least some of these individuals, especially the Azov members, on trial, which in turn calls into question the prospects for a future prisoner swap.\n\nA court should decide the fate of \"those who appear to be nationalists,\" Denis Pushilin, the ostensible leader of the DNR told a local media outlet according to secondary reports. He reportedly added that top Azov members have yet to emerge from Azovstal. Earlier in the week, Russian authorities said they planned to question those who had surrendered as part of an investigation into \"Ukrainian war crimes.\"\n\n\"An operation is underway, the details of which I will not announce,\" Svyatoslav Palamar, Azov's Deputy head, who is among those still in the steelworks claiming to still be fighting on, said in a separate video message circulated on social media.\n\nIndependent human rights group Amnesty International called for assurances that all of those at Azovstal who surrender will be treated humanely. The organization added that it \"has documented summary killings of captives by Russia-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine.\"\n\nThe AP reported today, citing an anonymous U.S. official, that American authorities have intelligence indicating that Russian commanders themselves are concerned about abuses their forces are committing in Mariupol.\n\nUkrainian officials said earlier in the week that there were negotiations ongoing about what might happen next to those surrendering in Mariupol, including a possible prisoner swap.\n\nRegardless, as already noted, the final collapse of the Ukrainian defense of Mariupol is set to be a significant victory for Russia both operationally and from the propaganda perspective. For weeks now, forces at Azovstal faced increasingly dire circumstances. Video footage seen below that was reportedly taken by a medic within the complex who is now in Russian custody highlights the horrific conditions in the city.\n\nHowever, they were able to hold out long enough to deny the Russian government a tangible success ahead of the marking of the anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II on May 9. This in turn kept significant Russian and Russian-backed forces occupied and unable to be redeployed elsewhere, as noted in the U.K. Defense Ministry assessment in the Tweet below.\n\nThe Russian military is still keen to find victories where it can as Ukrainian forces continue to stymie its attempts to make significant gain in the Donbas and have actively counterattacked in the northeastern Kharkiv region. The U.K. Ministry of Defense issued a statement earlier today saying it had information that Russian Army Lt. Gen. Serhiy Kisel, previously head of the 1st Guards Tank Army, was suspended over the failure of the country's forces to capture Kharkiv. That same release said that Russian Navy Vice Adm. Igor Osipov, previously commander of the Black Sea Fleet, had also been sacked over the loss of the cruiser Moskva. A senior U.S. defense official said today that they could not confirm these reports.\n\nIn the meantime, Russian forces are advancing, at least to some degree, but continue to face significant difficulties on the battlefield. A senior defense official said today that Russia had been forced to recommit understrength units to the fighting, as well as reconsolidate other formations that have experienced significant losses, in order to keep up the pressure in the Donbas region.\n\nUkrainian forces have and are still putting up a very spirited defense in the Donbas. This has included the destruction of various established bridges to hamper Russian movements in the region and force the invaders to make riskier crossings across rivers like the Donets using pontoon assault bridges. The video below shows Ukrainian forces using anti-tank mines and commercial explosives to cut a railway bridge along the line between the cities of Severodonetsk and Rubizhne.\n\nA Tweet earlier this week, seen below, from the official U.S. Army Europe and Africa account indirectly referenced the growing number of failed Russian river crossings in Ukraine.\n\nThere remain no indications that the Russian military has embarked on a broader mobilization to increase its combat capacity in Ukraine. At the same time, U.S. officials, among others, continue to stress that Russia still has considerable forces available in the country that should not be discounted out of hand. \"This could be a prolonged fight,\" a senior U.S. defense official said today.\n\nU.S. Army Gen. Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke with Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov today. \"The military leaders discussed several security-related issues of concern and agreed to keep the lines of communications open,\" according to a Pentagon readout of the call. The U.K. Ministry of Defense had earlier questioned publicly whether Gerarismov still had Putin's confidence. This also comes nearly a week after U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin held his first call in months with his Russian counterpart, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.\n\nForeign military aid is still flowing to Ukraine. Today, the Pentagon announced plans to send a new $100 million military assistance package to the country that includes 18 M777 155mm towed howitzers, an equal number of vehicles to pull them along, and three AN/TPQ-36 counter-artillery radars, among other items.\n\nUkrainian troops are now reportedly training to use unspecified electronic warfare systems that the U.S. military has transferred.\n\nThe video below shows Polish-supplied T-72M1 tanks fitted with explosive reactive armor (ERA) now in Ukrainian service.\n\nThe video below appears to be one of, if not the first look at a Ukrainian servicemember employing a Polish-made Piorun shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile, or man-portable air defense system (MANPADS).\n\nAuthorities in Moscow say a previously unknown laser directed energy weapon, called Zadira, is now in use in Ukraine and that Russian forces have employed it to shoot down hostile drones. There is nothing so far to independently confirm or refute these claims. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to the news by saying that the announcement \"clearly indicates the complete failure of the invasion\" and that the Russian military is looking for a \"wonder weapon\" to turn the tide of the war.\n\nPictures, like those seen below, of Russian BMPT Terminator armored vehicles deployed in Ukraine continue to emerge.\n\nThe picture in the Tweet below reportedly shows a Russian servicemember with what could be a portable electronic warfare system or a communications array.\n\nThe pictures in the Tweets below show new examples of improvised armor and camouflage that Russian and Russian-backed forces are employing in Ukraine. Similar field modifications have been seen on multiple occasions in the past, underscoring the threats that Ukrainian forces armed with various shoulder-fired anti-armor weapons and drones carrying improvised munitions, among other weapons, present to invading units.\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine continues to cause significant damage to the country's infrastructure and significant resources will be necessary for reconstruction after it comes to an end. The U.K. Ministry of Defense released an assessment earlier in the week that said that 3,500 mostly residential buildings in the Chernihiv region north of the capital Kyiv had been destroyed in earlier fighting. British authorities expressed concern that similar devastation could be wrought in areas of Ukraine still seeing active combat.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Ukraine's capital Kyiv formally reopened yesterday, but only limited duties are being performed there still. This came on the same day that the U.S. Senate confirmed Bridget Brink, currently ambassador to Slovakia, to become ambassador to Ukraine. Brink is set to become the first formal American ambassador to Ukraine in three years. Kristina Kvien, the Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires at the Embassy in Ukraine, has been acting in this role.\n\nThe U.S. State Department separately announced that it was establishing a new \"Conflict Observatory\" with the stated aim of being able \"to capture, analyze, and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and atrocities in Ukraine.\"\n\nProsecutors in Ukraine today requested a life sentence for the first Russian soldier to be put on trial for war crimes in the course of the conflict.\n\nWe will continue to update this post with new information until we state otherwise.\n\nContact the author: joe@thedrive.com", "source": {"uri": "thedrive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Drive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_trevithick@thedrive.com", "name": "Joseph Trevithick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.thedrive.com/uploads/2022/05/20/russian-troops-mariupol-surrenders.jpg?auto=webp", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 20, "stanza_neu": 63, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 83, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049278560", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "07:16:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T07:16:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T07:04:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5764706134796143, "url": "https://www.rador.ro/2022/05/21/ukraine-61/", "title": "UKRAINE", "body": "The industrial region of Donbas in Ukraine has been completely destroyed by the Russian forces, the president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said.

Odessa has been also a preferred target of Russian bombings lately, president Zelensky also said. Odessa is Ukraine's main port city and has been under Russian blockade since the war started, which prevents Ukraine's exports and affects global food supplies and food prices. On the other hand, the last Ukrainian soldiers in the Azovstal plant have been ordered by Kyiv to \"stop defending the city of Mariupol,\" the leader of the Azov Regiment announced.

Ukrainian media on Thursday circulated a video showing the deputy commander of the Azov regiment Svyatoslav Palamar. \"I and the command are at the Azovstal plant. There is a certain operation going on, the details of which I will not say anything. We thank the whole world, we thank Ukraine,\" said Palamar.\n\nThe authenticity of the video could not be checked immediately, and it was widely discussed in the Ukrainian media. Representatives of the Ukrainian government, such as the adviser to the Ukrainian Minister of the Interior, also spread the word.\n\nAccording to Russian information, however, other fighters from the steel mill have surrendered. Moscow announced on Thursday that more than 770 Ukrainians had been arrested on the Azovstal site within 24 hours. Since the beginning of the week, 1,730 Ukrainian fighters have surrendered. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had registered several hundred fighters from the plant who are now prisoners of war.\n\nWhat happens to them is just as unclear as the number of people who are actually still holed up in the steel mill. Initially, there was no information from the Ukrainian side. Kyiv hopes that Moscow will agree to a prisoner swap. However, Russian officials have repeatedly emphasized that they want to distinguish between members of the Azov regiment and other Ukrainian soldiers. A ban on the exchange of Azov fighters was also discussed by the Moscow parliament.\n\nRussian troops attacked the port city of Mariupol in early March and conquered it in weeks of fighting - except for the Azovstal steelworks. The complete capture of Mariupol would be a strategic success for Moscow. According to the Ukrainian General Staff, fierce resistance in the port city has significantly slowed the advance of Russian forces towards the large city of Zaporizhia, which is still in Ukrainian hands.", "source": {"uri": "nationalturk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NationalTurk"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.nationalturk.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/azov-militans.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 16, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 21, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7050072404", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-22", "time": "03:26:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-22T03:26:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-22T03:22:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5764706134796143, "url": "https://bdnews24.com/world/europe/2022/05/22/as-russia-intensifies-push-for-donbas-ukraine-rules-out-ceasefire", "title": "As Russia intensifies push for Donbas, Ukraine rules out ceasefire", "body": "Ukraine ruled out a ceasefire or concessions to Moscow on Saturday as Russia intensified an offensive in the eastern Donbas region and stopped providing gas to Finland.\n\nAfter ending weeks of resistance by the last Ukrainian fighters in the strategic southeastern city of Mariupol, Russia is waging what appears to be a major offensive in Luhansk, one of two provinces in Donbas.\n\nRussian-backed separatists already controlled swathes of territory in Luhansk and the neighbouring Donetsk province before the Feb. 24 invasion, but Moscow wants to seize the last remaining Ukrainian-held territory in Donbas.\n\n\"The situation in Donbas is extremely difficult,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address. The Russian army was trying to attack the cities of Sloviansk and Sievierodonetsk, but Ukrainian forces were holding off their advance, he said.\n\nEarlier, Zelensky told local television that although the fighting would be bloody, the end would come only through diplomacy and that the Russian occupation of Ukrainian territory would be temporary.\n\nZelensky adviser Mykhailo Podolyak ruled out agreeing to a ceasefire and said Kyiv would not accept any deal with Moscow that involved ceding territory.

There was fighting on the outskirts of Sievierodonetsk from morning through the night, he said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nSievierodonetsk and its twin Lysychansk across the Siverskiy Donets River form the eastern part of a Ukrainian-held pocket that Russia has been trying to overrun since mid-April after failing to capture Kyiv.\n\nGAS DISPUTE\n\nRussia's state gas company, Gazprom, said it halted gas exports to Finland, which refused Moscow's demands to pay in roubles for Russian gas after Western countries imposed sanctions over the invasion.\n\nFinland and Sweden applied this week to join the NATO military alliance.\n\nFinnish state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum, the Finnish government and individual gas consuming companies in Finland have said they were prepared for a shutdown of Russian flows.\n\nMost European supply contracts are denominated in euros or dollars. Last month, Moscow cut off gas to Bulgaria and Poland after they refused to comply with the new terms.\n\nWestern nations also have stepped up weapons supplies to Ukraine. On Saturday, Kyiv got another huge boost when US President Joe Biden signed a bill to provide nearly $40 billion in military, economic and humanitarian aid.\n\nMoscow says Western sanctions, along with arms deliveries for Kyiv, amount to a \"proxy war\" by the United States and its allies.\n\nThe Russian military said it had destroyed a major consignment of Western arms in Ukraine's Zhytomyr region, west of Kyiv, using sea-launched Kalibr cruise missiles.

Others were said to be hospitalised.\n\nThe defense of the steel mill had been led by Ukraine's Azov Regiment, whose far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast its invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Russia said the Azov commander was taken away from the plant in an armored vehicle.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\nThe steelworks, which sprawled across 11 square kilometers (4 square miles), had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire, before their government ordered them to abandon the plant's defense and save themselves.\n\nThe complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 -- a conflict that was supposed to have been a lightning conquest for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of forces to refocus on eastern Ukraine, and the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet.\n\nMilitary analysts said Mariupol's capture at this point is of mostly symbolic importance, since the city was already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the fighting there had already left.\n\nMariupol endured some of the worst suffering of the war and became a worldwide symbol of defiance. An estimated 100,000 people remained out a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\n\nA maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the place. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600.\n\nSatellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves just outside Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians.\n\nEarlier this month, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires and spoke of the terror of ceaseless bombardment, the dank conditions underground and the fear that they wouldn't make it out alive.\n\nAs the end drew near at Azovstal, wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks told of what they feared would be their last contact with their husbands.\n\nOlga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: \"Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye.\" Natalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, \"Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly.\" She said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded.\n\nWhile Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a mission fulfilled. They said the fighters had tied down Moscow's forces and hindered their bid to seize the east.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as \"the Thermopylae of the 21st century\" -- a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_18_29_23_945969.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 16, "stanza_neu": 16, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 32, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7048880126", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "20:09:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T20:09:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T20:09:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5647059082984924, "url": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-40877654.html", "title": "Russian forces 'take full control of Mariupol steel plant'", "body": "The seizure marks the end of a nearly three-month siege that reduced much of Mariupol to ruins and left more than 20,000 people feared dead.\n\nSergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin on Friday that the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol have been \"completely liberated\" from Ukrainian fighters.\n\nRussia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the defence ministry as saying that a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters holed up at Azovstal have laid down their arms and surrendered since May 16, including 531 on Friday.\n\nHowever, Ukrainian authorities said their troops have repelled a separate Russian attack in the east.\n\nThe Donbas is now President Vladimir Putin's focus after his troops failed to take the capital Kyiv in the early days of the war.\n\nPro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces for eight years in the region and held a considerable swathe of it before Russia's invasion on February 24.\n\nBut the effort to take more territory there has been slow-going. In a sign of Russia's frustration with the war, some senior commanders have been fired in recent weeks, the UK Ministry of Defence said.\n\nRussian forces attacked the cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk, both in the Luhansk region of the Donbas, the region's governor said on Friday.\n\nTwelve people were killed, and more than 60 houses were destroyed across the region, said Serhiy Haidai in a Telegram post.\n\nBut the attack on Severodonetsk was unsuccessful.

The goal is to ensure that Ukraine's financial situation does not affect its ability to defend itself from Russia's invasion.\n\nAlso, more US aid appeared to be on its way to Ukraine when the Senate overwhelmingly approved a 40 billion dollar package of military and economic aid for the country and its allies. The house of representatives voted for it last week, and US President Joe Biden's quick signature is certain.\n\n\"Help is on the way, really significant help.

AFP PHOTO\n\nKYIV: Russia said Thursday that 1,730 Ukrainian soldiers had surrendered this week at Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant, after a desperate battle that has become emblematic of the nearly three-month-old war.\n\nThe number included 80 wounded who were taken to a hospital in Russia-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine, Moscow said.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry released a video appearing to show exhausted Ukrainian soldiers trudging out of the sprawling steelworks, after a weeks-long siege forced the defenders and civilians to huddle in tunnels, enduring dire shortages of food, water and medicine.\n\nRussian troops patted down those surrendering and inspected their bags as they left, signaling the effective end of what Ukraine's government had called a \"heroic\" resistance.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said it had registered \"hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war\" from the plant in Mariupol, a port city obliterated by Russian shelling.\n\nUkraine is hoping to exchange the Azovstal soldiers for Russian prisoners. But pro-Kremlin authorities in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region said some of them could be put on trial.\n\nThe United States warned Thursday it would be watching the situation closely.\n\n\"Our expectation is...that all prisoners of war will be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention and the law of war,\" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.\n\nUkraine has already begun its own process of trying captured troops for crimes they are alleged to have committed, with prosecutors detailing 12,595 counts -- including the horrific bombing of a maternity ward in Mariupol.\n\n'Please forgive me'\n\nThe first Russian soldier to go on trial in Ukraine begged for forgiveness Thursday.\n\nVadim Shishimarin has admitted shooting dead Oleksandr Shelipov, an unarmed 62-year-old man, on February 28 -- four days into the invasion.\n\n\"I know that you will not be able to forgive me, but nevertheless I ask you for forgiveness,\" the 21-year-old sergeant told Shelipov's widow in the cramped courtroom in Kyiv.\n\nThe West's support for Kyiv stiffened further Thursday when a $40 billion aid package was approved by an unusually united US Congress.\n\nIt includes $6 billion earmarked for Ukraine to boost its armored vehicle inventory and air defense system.\n\nGermany also said it would contribute one billion euros to shore up Ukrainian government coffers as G7 finance ministers met to coordinate action.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has been lauded in Europe and the United States for his leadership in the face of Russian aggression, welcomed the package but insisted it would not only benefit his country.\n\n\"For our partners, it's not just expenses or a gift, it's their contribution to their own safety,\" he said.\n\n\"The defense of Ukraine also represents their own defense against new wars or crises that Russia can provoke.\"\n\nFamine warning\n\nRussia's actions are already redrawing the security map of Europe.\n\nUS President Joe Biden welcomed the leaders of Finland and Sweden after the Nordic nations decided to abandon decades of military non-alignment and join NATO.\n\n\"They meet every NATO requirement and then some,\" Biden told reporters.\n\nAdmission to the bloc must be approved unanimously by current members, and Turkey is a fly in the ointment, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan calling Sweden a \"complete terror haven.\"\n\nTurkey has rebuked the two countries for what it describes as leniency towards the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and other armed Kurdish groups.\n\nThe PKK has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984 and is blacklisted as a \"terrorist organization\" by Turkey and Western allies such as the European Union -- which includes Finland and Sweden.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was \"addressing the concerns that Turkey has expressed.\"\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed that remark, saying: \"If concerns are raised by any members of the alliance, they'll be addressed.\"\n\n\"I'm very confident that as this process moves forward, there will be a strong consensus for bringing both countries under the Alliance,\" he added.\n\nIn Finland, where previously lukewarm support for NATO membership has exploded since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, one brewery produced a special NATO beer.\n\nIt tastes of \"security, with a hint of freedom,\" brewer Petteri Vanttinen said.\n\nFood insecurity\n\nThe global ramifications of Russia's invasion continued to be felt, with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warning it could spark enduring food insecurity in some parts of the world.\n\n\"Malnutrition, mass hunger and famine\" could follow \"in a crisis that could last for years,\" Guterres warned, urging Russia to release grain exports from occupied Ukraine.\n\nRussia and Ukraine produce 30 percent of the world's wheat supply, and the war has already sent food prices surging around the world.\n\nUkrainian presidential administration head Andriy Yermak said the squeeze on global staples was a deliberate ploy to weaken international resolve.\n\n\"Being unable to access nearly one-third of our croplands, the systematic destruction by Russian forces of Ukrainian agriculture and transport infrastructure, the blockade of our seaports -- these are part of Russia's strategy of exerting pressure on the international community,\" he said.\n\nCivilians under fire\n\nDespite their last-ditch resistance in places such as Mariupol, and the successful defense of Kyiv, Ukrainian forces are retreating in the east.\n\nThe losses often come after weeks of battles over urban hubs that are pulverized by artillery fire by the time the Russians surround them.\n\nUkraine's defense ministry said Thursday that Russia was intensifying its attacks in the eastern Donbas region and preventing civilians from fleeing to Ukrainian-controlled territory.\n\nIn Severodonetsk, 12 people were killed and another 40 wounded when Russian forces shelled the eastern city, the regional governor said.\n\nIn the Kharkiv region, one man was killed and five others injured Thursday, while five civilians were killed and six others wounded in Donetsk.\n\nSeverodonetsk resident Nella Kashkina sat in her basement next to an oil lamp and prayed.\n\n\"I do not know how long we can last,\" the 65-year-old said.\n\n\"We

Border guards, police officers, and territorial defense squads formed shortly before the war supplemented their ranks.\n\nThe bulk of these forces were deployed to defend Mariupol, home to a stategically located port, at the start of the Russian invasion. Marines from the 36th brigade held the port and another large plant in Mariupol for more than a month, until they ran out of supplies and ammunition.\n\nThey moved to the Azovstal steel mill to join the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right, and some of them were captured by the Russians.\n\nWHY DOES RUSSIA LABEL THEM 'NATIONALISTS'?\n\nIn announcing Azovstal's seizure, the Russian Defense Ministry's chief spokesman referred to the Azov Regiment's fighters as Nazis and said their commander was taken away in an armored vehicle because of local residents' alleged hatred of him \"for numerous atrocities.\"\n\nNo evidence has surfaced of the regiment mistreating Ukrainian civilians, hundreds of whom sheltered underground with the fighters. The regiment released several videos taken inside Azovstal that showed their members interacting with the civilians and giving children sweets.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly made negative assertions about the Azov Regiment.\n\nThe National Guard unit grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that rose to bolster Ukraine's underfunded and questionably led military in the fight against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThat conflict broke out after massive protests drove Ukraine's Kremlin-leaning president from office.\n\nThe Azov Battalion drew its initial fighters from far-right circles and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. Its current members rejected accusations of nationalism and radicalism. Sviatoslav Palamar, the regiment's deputy commander, said in a recent interview from the steel mill that he preferred the term \"patriotism.\"\n\nWHAT DID THE DEFENDERS ACCOMPLISH?\n\nAs Mariupol became a symbol of the suffering and resistance of Ukrainians after Russia invaded their country, Ukrainian officials repeatedly stressed the role the fighters at Azovstal played in defending the city and stymying Russian progress elsewhere.\n\n\"The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol have already performed a feat, drawing the elite forces of the Russian army onto themselves and significantly slowing down the advance of the Russians in the southeast,\" Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said.\n\nAfter the plant's defenders were instructed to end their fight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the move was proper and humane because \"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle.\"\n\nThe ruined seaside city and the outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian fighters whose persistence frustrated Russia's objective to capture Mariupol quickly are now irrevocably etched into Ukrainian history, regardless of the outcome of the war.\n\nThe defense of Mariupol \"will go down in history as Thermopylae of the 21st century,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's president, said as the fighters started leaving the plant. \"The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy's plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war.\"\n\nThermopylae is widely considered one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing. They were killed to a man, including their king.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Hours before Russia's announcement on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the last defenders at the steelworks had been told by Ukraine's military that they could get out and save their lives.\n\nRussia said there were 531 members of the last group that had given up. \"The territory of the Azovstal metallurgical plant... has been completely liberated,\" the ministry said in a statement, adding that a total of 2,439 defenders had surrendered in the past few days. The Ukrainians did not immediately confirm those figures.\n\nRussia also launched what appeared to be a major assault to seize the last remaining Ukrainian-held territory in the province of Luhansk, one of two southeastern Ukrainian provinces Moscow proclaims as independent states. \"The Russian army has started very intensive destruction of the town of Sievierodonetsk, the intensity of shelling doubled, they are shelling residential quarters, destroying house by house,\" Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said on his Telegram channel.\n\n\"We do not know how many people died, because it is simply impossible to go through and look at every apartment,\" he said. The city of Sievierodonetsk and its twin Lyshchansk across the Siverskiy Donets river form the eastern part of a Ukrainian-held pocket Russia has been trying to overrun since mid-April after failing to capture the capital Kyiv.\n\nUkraine's general staff said it had pushed back an offensive on Sievierodonetsk, part of what it described as major Russian operations along a stretch of the frontline. Despite losing ground elsewhere in recent weeks, Russian forces have advanced on the Luhansk front, in what some military analysts view as a major push to achieve scaled-down war aims of capturing more territory claimed by pro-Russian rebels.\n\nNatalia Zarytska, wife of an Azovstal fighter who surrendered, said she had not heard from him since a Telegram message exchange two days ago. She believed he was still alive. \"The situation is really hard and horrible and my husband is on the way from one hell to another hell, from Azovstal steel plant to a prison, to captivity,\" Zarytska said in Istanbul, where she and other relatives lobbied Turkey to help save the fighters.\n\nThe Red Cross said it has registered hundreds of Ukrainians who surrendered at the plant as prisoners of war and Kyiv says it wants a prisoner swap. Moscow says the prisoners will be treated humanely, but Russian politicians have been quoted as saying some must be tried or even executed. Russian forces in Ukraine have been driven in recent weeks from the area surrounding Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv, their fastest retreat since being forced out of the north and the Kyiv region at the end of March.\n\nBut they still control a large swathe of the south and east, and the end of fighting in Mariupol means that territory is now largely unbroken. In a sign of Russia's aim to boost its war effort, the parliament in Moscow said it would consider letting Russians over 40 and foreigners over 30 join the military.\n\n(This story has not been edited

\"broken the backbone\" of the Russian army and will gain victory in bloody battle, but the end of the war will be achieved through diplomacy, says Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nIn a TV interview to mark his third year as president, Mr Zelensky said Ukraine's military had inflicted enough damage on Russia to ensure \"they will not be able to get back on their feet for the next few years\".\n\nHis comments came as Russia claimed control of Mariupol after the last 2400 Ukrainian forces, who been defending the city's Azovstal steelworks, surrendered and were taken captive.\n\nDespite this strategic setback for Ukraine, Mr Zelensky declared that his country \"wanted everything back\" from Russia.\n\nAnd he vowed Ukraine would take it all back, adding that the country's forces would return the front lines to where they were before February 24, when Russia invaded.\n\n\"It will mean that they did not conquer us and that we defended our country,\" he said, though he noted this would be difficult and that diplomacy would follow.\n\nMeanwhile Moscow has published a \"stop list\" of 963 Americans who will be indefinitely banned from entering Russia, including politicians, journalists, CEOs and a Hollywood celebrity.\n\nRussia's ministry said the US citizens were singled out because they \"incite Russophobia\" and the ban was necessary to force America to change its behaviour by \"realising a new geopolitical reality\".\n\nThe list includes US President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and most US senators and members of the House of Representatives.\n\nOthers were Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg, and actor Morgan Freeman who The Kremlin said had accused Russia of plotting against the US and \"calling for a fight against our country\".\n\n(Freeman appeared in a video in 2017 that accused Russia of meddling in the 2016 US presidential election which was won by Donald Trump).\n\nRussia is moving closer to claiming victory over Ukraine's Donbas

to join the NATO military alliance, a decision spurred by the Ukraine war.\n\nBut Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has objected to Sweden and Finland's applications because of his concerns the

"Russia said Thursday that 1,730 Ukrainian soldiers had surrendered this week at Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant, after a desperate battle that has become emblematic of the nearly three-month-old war.\n\nThe number included 80 wounded who were taken to a hospital in Russia-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine, Moscow said.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry released a video appearing to show exhausted Ukrainian soldiers trudging out of the sprawling steelworks, after a weeks-long siege forced the defenders and civilians to huddle in tunnels, enduring dire shortages of food, water and medicine.\n\nRussian troops patted down those surrendering and inspected their bags as they left, signalling the effective end of what Ukraine's government had called a \"heroic\" resistance.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said it had registered \"hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war\" from the plant in Mariupol, a port city obliterated by Russian shelling.\n\nUkraine is hoping to exchange the Azovstal soldiers for Russian prisoners. But pro-Kremlin authorities in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region said some of them could be put on trial.\n\nThe United States warned Thursday it would be watching the situation closely.\n\n\"Our expectation is... that all prisoners of war will be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention and the law of war,\" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.\n\nUkraine has already begun its own process of trying captured troops for crimes they are alleged to have committed, with prosecutors detailing 12,595 counts -- including the horrific bombing of a maternity ward in Mariupol.\n\n- 'Please forgive me' -\n\nThe first Russian soldier to go on trial in Ukraine begged for forgiveness Thursday.\n\nVadim Shishimarin has admitted shooting dead Oleksandr Shelipov, an unarmed 62-year-old man, on February 28 -- four days into the invasion.\n\n\"I know that you will not be able to forgive me, but nevertheless I ask you for forgiveness,\" the 21-year-old sergeant told Shelipov's widow in the cramped courtroom in Kyiv.\n\nThe West's support for Kyiv stiffened further Thursday when a $40 billion aid package was approved by an unusually united US Congress.\n\nIt includes $6 billion earmarked for Ukraine to boost its armoured vehicle inventory and air defence system.\n\nGermany also said it would contribute one billion euros to shore up Ukrainian government coffers as G7 finance ministers met to coordinate action.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been lauded in Europe and the United States for his leadership in the face of Russian aggression, welcomed the package, but insisted it would not only benefit his country.\n\n\"For our partners, it's not just expenses or a gift, it's their contribution to their own safety,\" he said.\n\n\"The defence of Ukraine also represents their own defence against new wars or crises that Russia can provoke.\"\n\n- Famine warning -\n\nRussia's actions are already redrawing the security map of Europe.\n\nUS President Joe Biden welcomed the leaders of Finland and Sweden after the Nordic nations decided to abandon decades of military non-alignment and join NATO.\n\n\"They meet every NATO requirement and then some,\" Biden told reporters.\n\nAdmission to the bloc must be approved unanimously by current members, and Turkey is a fly in the ointment, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan calling Sweden a \"complete terror haven\".\n\nTurkey has rebuked the two countries for what it describes as leniency towards the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and other armed Kurdish groups.\n\nThe PKK has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984 and is blacklisted as a \"terrorist organisation\" by Turkey and Western allies such as the European Union -- which includes Finland and Sweden.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was \"addressing the concerns that Turkey has expressed\".\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed that remark, saying: \"If concerns are raised by any members of the alliance, they'll be addressed.\"\n\n\"I'm very confident that as this process moves forward, there will be a strong consensus for bringing both countries under the Alliance,\" he added.\n\nIn Finland, where previously lukewarm support for NATO membership has exploded since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, one brewery produced a special NATO beer.\n\nIt tastes of \"security, with a hint of freedom\", brewer Petteri Vanttinen said.\n\n- Famine -\n\nThe global ramifications of Russia's invasion continued to be felt, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warning it could spark enduring food insecurity in some parts of the world.\n\n\"Malnutrition, mass hunger and famine\" could follow \"in a crisis that could last for years\", Guterres warned, urging Russia to release grain exports from occupied Ukraine.\n\nRussia and Ukraine produce 30 percent of the world's wheat supply, and the war has already sent food prices surging around the world.\n\nUkrainian presidential administration head Andriy Yermak said the squeeze on global staples was a deliberate ploy to weaken international resolve.\n\n\"Being unable to access nearly one-third of our croplands, the systematic destruction by Russian forces of Ukrainian agriculture and transport infrastructure, the blockade of our seaports -- these are part of Russia's strategy of exerting pressure on the international community,\" he said.\n\n- Civilians under fire -\n\nDespite their last-ditch resistance in places such as Mariupol, and the successful defence of Kyiv, Ukrainian forces are retreating in the east.\n\nThe losses often come after weeks of battles over urban hubs that are pulverised by artillery fire by the time the Russians surround them.\n\nUkraine's defence ministry said Thursday that Russia was intensifying its attacks in the eastern Donbas region and preventing civilians from fleeing to Ukrainian-controlled territory.\n\nIn Severodonetsk, 12 people were killed and another 40 wounded when Russian forces shelled the eastern city, the regional governor said.\n\nIn the Kharkiv region, one man was killed and five others injured Thursday, while

However, the politician also expressed frustration that the artillery pieces had not been the fitted with the digital computer systems.\n\nArtillery is currently playing a crucial role in the fighting across eastern Ukraine, as Russia continues its offensive in that part of the country. U.S. officials recently confirmed that all but one of the 90 howitzers promised to Ukraine had now been delivered, along with tactical vehicles used to tow them.\n\nIf fitted to a howitzer, the digital computer system enables the crew operating the weapon to quickly and accurately pinpoint a target. Howitzers without a computer system can still be fired accurately, using traditional methods to calculate the angle needed to hit a target.\n\nModern computer systems, however, rule out the possibility of human error. Why the artillery pieces supplied to Ukraine did not have the digital targeting technology installed is unclear.

Russia claimed Thursday that 1,730 Ukrainian soldiers had surrendered in Mariupol over the previous three days, while Ukraine confirmed Tuesday that more than 250 had yielded in the initial hours after it ordered them to do so.\n\nMariupol is the largest city that Russian forces have seized since launching an invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24. Its complete capture gives Russia total control of the coast of the Sea of Azov as well as a continuous stretch of territory along eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\n\"Staunch Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol since the start of the war means Russian forces in the area must be re-equipped and refurbished before they can be redeployed effectively,\" the U.K. defense ministry said. \"This can be a lengthy process when done thoroughly.\"\n\n\"Russian commanders, however, are under pressure to demonstrably achieve operational objectives,\" the ministry added. \"This means that Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition.\"\n\nMay 20, 6:42 am\n\nBelarus says nearly 28,000 Ukrainians have arrived since Russian invasion\n\nNearly 28,000 Ukrainian citizens have arrived in Belarus since Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, according to the Belarusian State Border Committee.\n\n\"Between 6 a.m. on February 24 and 6 a.m. on May 20, a total of 27,868 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Belarus, including 15,793 who crossed the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, 10,563 by transit through Poland, 1,305 through Lithuania, and 207 through Latvia,\" the committee said in a statement Friday.\n\nIn the past 24 hours alone, 154 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Belarus, including 120 via Poland, according to the committee.\n\nBelarus shares a land border with both Ukraine and Russia, and is Moscow's main ally.\n\nMay 19, 8:07 pm\n\nBiden to sign Ukraine aid bill while abroad\n\nPresident Joe Biden will sign the $40 billion Ukraine aid bill while he's in Asia, a White House official said.\n\n\"The president does intend to sign the bill while he's on the road so that he can sign it expeditiously,\" national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One while en route to the region Thursday evening. \"The modalities of that are being worked right now so that he can get it and sign it.\"\n\nThe bill, which passed the Senate earlier Thursday with bipartisan support, will need to be flown to the region so that Biden can sign it.

Earlier in the week, Ukrainian officials said its combatants in the Azovstal steel plant had completed their mission and were being evacuated, describing them as heroes who had fulfilled a gruelling task.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at these Ukrainian forces, who were taken prisoner by the Russians as they left the plant, and what they accomplished:\n\nWho were Mariupol\u2019s defenders?\n\nRussia\u2019s Defence Ministry said 2,439 Ukrainian fighters from the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nThe fighters who held out at Azovstal, for much of the nearly three-month siege of Mariupol with Ukrainian civilians who sought safety in the plant\u2019s underground bunkers and tunnels, came from a variety of different military and law enforcement units, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nThere was the Azov Regiment, which is part of Ukraine\u2019s National Guard; the 36th Special Marine Brigade of Ukraine\u2019s Naval Forces and the 12th brigade of the National Guard. Border guards, police officers, and territorial defence squads formed soon before the war supplemented their ranks.\n\nThe bulk of these forces were deployed to defend Mariupol, home to a strategically located port, at the start of the Russian invasion. Marines from the 36th brigade held the port and another large plant in Mariupol for more than a month, until they ran out of supplies and ammunition.\n\nThey moved to the Azovstal steel mill to join the Azov Regiment, a national guard unit with roots in the far right, and some of them were captured by the Russians.Russia claims to have taken full control of Ukraine\u2019s MariupolWhy does Russia label them as \u201cNationalists\u201d?\n\nIn announcing Azovstal\u2019s seizure, the Russian Defence Ministry\u2019s chief spokesman referred to the Azov Regiment\u2019s fighters as Nazis and said their Commander was taken away in an armoured vehicle because of local residents\u2019 alleged hatred of him \u201cfor numerous atrocities.\u201d\n\nNo evidence has surfaced of the regiment mistreating Ukrainian civilians, hundreds of whom sheltered underground with the fighters. The regiment released several videos taken inside Azovstal that showed their members interacting with the civilians and giving children sweets.\n\nRussian officials and state media repeatedly made negative assertions about the Azov Regiment.\n\nThe National Guard unit grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that rose to bolster Ukraine\u2019s underfunded and questionably led military in the fight against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThat conflict broke out after massive protests drove Ukraine\u2019s Kremlin-leaning president from office.\n\nThe Azov Battalion drew its initial fighters from far-right circles and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. Its current members rejected accusations of nationalism and radicalism. Sviatoslav Palamar, the regiment\u2019s deputy Commander, said in a recent interview from the steel mill that he preferred the term \u201cpatriotism.\u201d\n\nWhat did the defenders accomplish?\n\nAs Mariupol became a symbol of the suffering and resistance of Ukrainians after Russia invaded their country, Ukrainian officials repeatedly stressed the role the fighters at Azovstal played in defending the city and stymying Russian progress elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainian troops in Mariupol have already performed a feat, drawing the elite forces of the Russian army onto themselves and significantly slowing down the advance of the Russians in the southeast,\u201d Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said.\n\nAfter the plant\u2019s defenders were instructed to end their fight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the move was proper and humane because \u201cUkraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It\u2019s our principle.\u201d\n\nThe ruined seaside city and the outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian fighters whose persistence frustrated Russia\u2019s objective to capture Mariupol quickly are now irrevocably etched into Ukrainian history, regardless of the outcome of the war.\n\nThe defence of Mariupol \u201cwill go down in history as Thermopylae of the 21st century,\u201d Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s president, said as the fighters started leaving the plant. \u201cThe Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy\u2019s plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war.\u201d\n\nThermopylae is widely considered one of history\u2019s most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing.

We cannot pay the price of tens, hundreds of thousands of people. So please help us,\" he said.\n\nCosta became the latest Western leader to visit Kyiv. In addition to meeting Zelenskiy, the Portuguese leader met Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and signed an agreement for unspecified financial support.\n\nKyiv also got another huge boost of aid from the United States when U.S. President Joe Biden signed a bill to provide nearly $40 billion in military, economic, and humanitarian aid to the country.\n\n\"Look forward to new, powerful defense assistance.

expectation is... that all prisoners of war will be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention and the law of war,\" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.\n\nUkraine has already begun its own process of trying captured troops for crimes they are alleged to have committed, with prosecutors detailing 12,595 counts -- including the horrific bombing of a maternity ward in Mariupol.\n\nVadim Shishimarin has admitted shooting dead Oleksandr Shelipov, an unarmed 62-year-old man, on February 28 -- four days into the invasion.\n\n\"I know that you will not be able to forgive me, but nevertheless I ask you for forgiveness,\" the 21-year-old sergeant told Shelipov's widow in the cramped courtroom in Kyiv.\n\nThe West's support for Kyiv stiffened further Thursday when a $40 billion aid package was approved by an unusually united US Congress.\n\nIt includes $6 billion earmarked for Ukraine to boost its armoured vehicle inventory and air defence system.\n\nGermany also said it would contribute one billion euros to shore up Ukrainian government coffers as G7 finance ministers met to coordinate action.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been lauded in Europe and the United States for his leadership in the face of Russian aggression, welcomed the package, but insisted it would not only benefit his country.\n\n\"For our partners, it's not just expenses or a gift, it's their contribution to their own safety,\" he said.\n\nUS President Joe Biden welcomed the leaders of Finland and Sweden after the Nordic nations decided to abandon decades of military non-alignment and join NATO.\n\n\"They meet every NATO requirement and then some,\" Biden told reporters.\n\nAdmission to the bloc must be approved unanimously by current members, and Turkey is a fly in the ointment, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan calling Sweden a \"complete terror haven\".\n\nTurkey has rebuked the two countries for what it describes as leniency towards the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and other armed Kurdish groups.\n\nThe PKK has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984 and is blacklisted as a \"terrorist organisation\" by Turkey and Western allies such as the European Union -- which includes Finland and Sweden.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was \"addressing the concerns that Turkey has expressed\".\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed that remark, saying: \"If concerns are raised by any members of the alliance, they'll be addressed.\"\n\n\"I'm very confident that as this process moves forward, there will be a strong consensus for bringing both countries under the Alliance,\" he added.\n\nIn Finland, where previously lukewarm support for NATO membership has exploded since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, one brewery produced a special NATO beer.\n\nIt tastes of \"security, with a hint of freedom\", brewer Petteri Vanttinen said.\n\n- Famine -\n\nThe global ramifications of Russia's invasion continued to be felt, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warning it could spark enduring food insecurity in some parts of the world.\n\n\"Malnutrition, mass hunger and famine\" could follow \"in a crisis that could last for years\", Guterres warned, urging Russia to release grain exports from occupied Ukraine.\n\nRussia and Ukraine produce 30 percent of the world's wheat supply, and the war has already sent food prices surging around the world.\n\nUkrainian presidential administration head Andriy Yermak said the squeeze on global staples was a deliberate ploy to weaken international resolve.\n\n\"Being unable to access nearly one-third of our croplands, the systematic destruction by Russian forces of Ukrainian agriculture and transport infrastructure, the blockade of our seaports -- these are part of Russia's strategy of exerting pressure on the international community,\" he said.\n\n- Civilians under fire -\n\nDespite their last-ditch resistance in places such as Mariupol, and the successful defence of Kyiv, Ukrainian forces are retreating in the east.\n\nThe losses often come after weeks of battles over urban hubs that are pulverised by artillery fire by the time the Russians surround them.\n\nUkraine's defence ministry said Thursday that Russia was intensifying its attacks in the eastern Donbas region and preventing civilians from fleeing to Ukrainian-controlled territory.\n\nIn Severodonetsk, 12 people were killed and another 40 wounded when Russian forces shelled the eastern city, the regional governor said.\n\nIn the Kharkiv region, one man was killed and five others injured Thursday, while five civilians were killed and six others wounded in Donetsk.\n\nSeverodonetsk resident Nella Kashkina sat in her basement next to an

And all this will return - since this is our territory,\" he said on Saturday.\n\nZelensky adviser Mykhailo Podolyak ruled out agreeing to a ceasefire and said Kyiv would not accept any deal with Moscow that involved ceding territory. He said making concessions would backfire on Ukraine because Russia would hit back harder after any break in fighting.\n\n\"They'll start a new offensive, even more bloody and large-scale,\" Mr Podolyak, Ukraine's lead negotiator, told Reuters in an interview in the heavily guarded presidential office.\n\nRecent calls for an immediate ceasefire have come from US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.\n\nIn a conversation with Mr Draghi on Saturday, Mr Zelensky said he stressed the importance of more sanctions on Russia and unblocking Ukrainian ports.\n\nThe end of fighting in Mariupol, the biggest city Russia has captured, could be crucial to its ambitions in Donbas. It gives Russian President Vladimir Putin a rare victory after a series of setbacks in nearly three months of combat.\n\nThe last Ukrainian forces holed up Mariupol's vast Azovstal steelworks surrendered on Friday, Russia's defence ministry said.\n\nFull control of Mariupol gives Russia command of an overland route linking the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014, with mainland Russia and areas of eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russia separatists.\n\nDespite losing ground elsewhere in recent weeks, Russian forces have advanced on the Luhansk front.\n\nLuhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said Russia was trying to destroy the city of Sievierodonetsk, with fighting on the outskirts from morning throughout the night.\n\nSievierodonetsk and its twin Lysychansk across the Siverskiy Donets River form the eastern part of a Ukrainian-held pocket that Russia has been trying to overrun since mid-April after failing to capture Kyiv.\n\nRussian troops destroyed a bridge on the Siverskiy Donets River between Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, Mr Gaidai said on the Telegram messaging app. He said the bridge was also destroyed during the fighting in 2014 and was rebuilt.\n\nUkrainian military spokesman Oleksandr Shtupun said Russian activity was focused in the east, with troops trying to break through defences in Donetsk to reach the Luhansk region border.\n\nRussia's state gas company, Gazprom, said it halted gas exports to Finland, which refused Moscow's demands to pay in roubles for Russian gas after Western countries imposed sanctions over the invasion.\n\nFinland and Sweden applied this week to join the NATO military alliance.\n\nFinnish state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum, the Finnish government and individual gas consuming companies in Finland have said they were prepared for a shutdown of Russian flows.\n\nMost European supply contracts are denominated in euros or dollars. Last month, Moscow cut off gas to Bulgaria and Poland after they refused to comply with the new terms.\n\nWestern nations also have stepped up weapons supplies to Ukraine. On Saturday, Kyiv got another huge boost when US President Joe Biden signed a bill to provide nearly $US40 billion ($57 billion) in military, economic and humanitarian aid.\n\nMoscow says Western sanctions, along with arms deliveries for Kyiv, amount to a \"proxy war\" by the United States and its allies.\n\nThe Russian military said it had destroyed a major consignment of Western arms in Ukraine's Zhytomyr region, west of Kyiv, using sea-launched Kalibr cruise missiles.

I would call it a long-awaited process. We are grateful for the great military support provided by various states. We expect a positive [response] on the supply of MLRS,\" Zelenskiy was quoted as saying in response to questions from reporters following talks with Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa in Kyiv.\n\n\"I have no secrets, we appeal to all countries -- from the United States to every European country on MLRS,\"\n\nHe said the MLRS \"just stand still\" in other countries but would be \"key\" to Ukraine's ability to take the initiative and liberate its territory.\n\nZelenskiy also addressed reservations expressed by some countries that Kyiv will use rocket systems to attack Russia, saying those who have such concerns should consider that the war continues on Ukrainian territory, including the Donbas area.\n\n\"These are our territories, and we are going step by step to liberate them. We cannot pay the price of tens, hundreds of thousands of people. So please help us,\" he said.\n\nCosta became the latest Western leader to visit Kyiv. In addition to meeting Zelenskiy, the Portuguese leader met Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and signed an agreement for unspecified financial support.\n\nKyiv also got another huge boost of aid from the United States when U.S. President Joe Biden signed a bill to provide nearly $40 billion in military, economic, and humanitarian aid to the country.\n\n\"Look forward to new, powerful defense assistance. Today it is needed more than ever,\" Zelenskiy said on Twitter.\n\nZelenskiy said earlier on Ukrainian television that his country could be victorious on the battlefield -- but that things could only come to a conclusive halt \"at the negotiating table.\"\n\nHe warned that there will be more fighting but the conflict \"will only definitively end through diplomacy.\"\n\nThe developments in Kyiv came as Russia moved nearer to taking control over Ukraine's Donbas region, claiming victory in the monthslong battle for Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant while launching a major offensive in the eastern Luhansk region.\n\nThe last Ukrainian forces holed up in the Azovstal steelworks surrendered on May 20, Russia's Defense Ministry said.\n\nIt came after a devastating siege that has left Mariupol in complete ruins, with some 20,000 feared dead.\n\n\"The underground facilities of the enterprise, where the militants were hiding, came under the full control of the Russian armed forces,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\nIt said 531 people were in the group that gave up most recently and that brought to 2,439 the total number of defenders who had surrendered in the past few days.\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine, but Zelenskiy said earlier than the Azovstal defenders got a clear signal from military command that they could get out and save their lives.\n\nZelensky said in the television interview that the Ukrainian Army had inflicted serious damage on Russia's armed forces despite the fall of Mariupol, which Russia sought to capture to complete a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it annexed in 2014.\n\nConcern mounted for the fate of the Ukrainian defenders who held out at the steelworks for weeks and now are prisoners in Russian hands.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the head of a Moscow-backed separatist group in the Donetsk region, said on May 21 that the Ukrainians were sure to face a tribunal.\n\n\"I believe that justice must be restored. There is a request for this from ordinary people, society, and, probably, the sane part of the world community,\" Russian state news agency TASS quoted Pushilin as saying.\n\nHe said on Russian state TV that some foreign nationals are among those who surrendered but did not provide further details.\n\nFamily members of the fighters who held out in the steelworks have pleaded for them to be given rights as prisoners of war (POWs) and eventually returned to Ukraine. The International Committee of the Red Cross said on May 20 it was registering them as POWs.\n\nUkraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said again on May 21 that authorities \"will fight for the return of every soldier\" captured from Azovstal steelworks.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia also launched what appeared to be a major assault to seize the last remaining Ukrainian-held territory in the Luhansk region.\n\n\"The Russian Army has started very intensive destruction of the town of Severodonetsk, the intensity of shelling doubled, they are shelling residential quarters, destroying house by house,\" Luhansk Governor Serhiy Hayday said on his Telegram channel.\n\nIn early hours of May 21, air-raid sirens were going off in much of Ukraine, including in the Kyiv region and the southern port of Odesa.\n\nUkraine's military General Staff said it had pushed back an offensive on Severodonetsk, part of what it described as major Russian operations along a stretch of the front line.\n\nRussia had sought control of Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, to complete a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it annexed in 2014, and to free up troops to join the battle for control of the Donbas region.\n\nZelenskiy said Russia should be made to pay for every home, school, hospital and business it destroys. He called on Ukraine's partners to seize Russian funds and property under their jurisdiction and use them to create a fund to compensate those who suffered.\n\nRussia \"would feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every shell that it has fired at us,\" he said in his nightly video address.\n\nSource: https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-mariupol- falls-luhansk-offensive/31861031.html\n\nCopyright (c) 2022.

Efrem Lukatsky/Associated Press\n\nThe package includes $20 billion in additional military aid to finance the transfer of advanced weapons systems - aid that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said was \"needed more than ever.\"\n\nRussia is continuing intense shelling of the easternmost city under Ukraine's control, Severodonetsk, which looks set to be the war's next major battlefield. With fighting underway on the city outskirts, Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai said that \"the Russians are destroying Severodonetsk, like Mariupol.\" Six civilians were killed Friday during Russian bombardments, he said.\n\nThe assault comes as Russia claims full control of the Azovstal steel plant, the sprawling complex that had been the final battleground for control of Mariupol. Russia's Defense Ministry said 2,439 Ukrainian fighters there have surrendered in recent days - a figure that drastically exceeds other estimates. Ukraine has not confirmed Moscow's claims that the entire facility is now in Russian hands.\n\nOutside Ukraine, the war's far-reaching diplomatic and economic impacts continue to be felt. Finland's gas transmission network operator said Saturday that Russia had stopped shipping natural gas to it. The suspension is widely viewed as retaliation after Helsinki formally applied to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nFinnish President Sauli Niinisto said Saturday that he had an \"open and direct phone call\" with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about Finland's NATO application, which Turkey has sought to block.\n\nNiinisto said he told Erdogan that Finland and Turkey would protect each other's security as NATO allies and have a closer relationship. Finland also \"condemns terrorism,\" Niinisto said he told Erdogan.\n\n\"Close dialogue continues,\" the Finnish president wrote.\n\nUkrainian servicemen sit on a bus after leaving Mariupol's besieged Azovstal steel plant, near a penal colony, in Olyonivka, in territory under the government of the Donetsk People's Republic, eastern Ukraine, on Friday.\n\nErdogan has voiced concerns about Finland and Sweden joining NATO, among them that they give safe harbor to terrorists, apparently referring to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has fought a separatist insurgency in parts of Turkey for decades.\n\nThe United States has also designated the PKK a terrorist organization, but has worked with other Kurdish groups fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nAdmitting Finland to NATO requires the approval of all 30 member states, so Turkey could stop the Nordic nation's accession.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n* Russia has prevented the evacuation of children, the sick and the elderly from the southern Kherson region to Ukrainian-held territory, a Ukrainian military spokesman said Saturday.\n\nIn an update posted on Facebook, Oleksandr Shtupun said Russian forces were also stopping the entry of food and medicine to the area.\n\nThe region's capital, also called Kherson, was the first major city to fall to Russian forces after the Feb. 24 invasion. The region's Russian-installed administration later said it intends to ask Moscow to incorporate the Kherson region into the Russian Federation.\n\nThe Ukrainian military spokesman's update also said that Russia began efforts to restore the port, notably by demining infrastructure, after Russian authorities declared Friday that they had taken \"full control\" of Mariupol's embattled steel plant.\n\nThe complex had been the last remaining stronghold of Ukrainian soldiers in the southeastern city, which lies on the Sea of Azov.\n\n* Ukrainian prosecutors have identified another Russian soldier who they allege was responsible for the death of Ukrainian citizens during the siege of the Kyiv region.\n\nA 30-year-old commander of Russia's 64th Motorized Rifle Brigade ordered his soldiers to kill civilians in the village of Lypivka, west of Bucha, Ukraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, posted Friday on Facebook. She named him as Vasyl Lytvynenko and called him \"responsible for violations of the laws and customs of war, as well as murder.\"\n\nThe announcement came a day after the first Russian soldier to be put on trial for war crimes since the invasion, 21-year-old Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, apologized in court to the widow of the 62-year-old civilian he admitted killing. Ukrainian prosecutors investigating the atrocities allegedly committed by Russian forces during the occupation of the Kyiv region say they plan to put captured soldiers on trial for war crimes despite limitations such as the difficulty of finding and collecting evidence amid a war.\n\nVenediktova described how village residents had to get permission from Lytvynenko to take medication and leave their homes for water during the Russian occupation. The prosecutor general also said Lytvynenko ordered his soldiers to wound an unarmed, elderly civilian in his own yard, shoot at the man's home with tank artillery and then set it ablaze.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, Venediktova said, as prosecutors try to determine who else played a role in the crimes, as well as Lytvynenko's alleged involvement in injuring two other people and destroying 18 homes.\n\n* The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations is sounding an alarm about the ongoing global food crisis.\n\n\"I can tell you on a scale of 1 to 10, I'm probably at the 10 level of alarm, because this crisis has exacerbated what is already a serious food insecurity issue,\" Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the BBC World Service on Friday.\n\nThe pandemic and climate change were already having a negative impact on global food supplies, she said, but the Russian invasion and its blockade of Ukrainian ports \"exacerbated this situation and made it even more dire, and the impact is being felt across the world.\"\n\nThomas-Greenfield said the United States plans to maintain pressure on Moscow to end the war. She denied that any discussions have been held on lifting sanctions in return for Russia easing the blockade on food supplies, stressing that no sanctions have targeted food production. She also urged other nations not to restrict food exports.\n\nLast week, India, the world's second-largest wheat producer, banned exports of the grain, citing its own food security needs amid soaring global prices.\n\nThe World Food Program has warned of \"catastrophic\" consequences if Ukrainian ports remain blocked, with many countries in the Middle East and Africa reliant on Ukrainian and Russian grains.\n\n* The Russian military risks weakening its operational effectiveness if it continues to lose reconnaissance drones at the current rate, the British Defense Ministry said in a Saturday intelligence update.\n\nRussian and Ukrainian forces have relied heavily on drones in the war, and attrition of this equipment has been heavy on both sides. For Russia, the devices identify battlefield targets that are then bombed by Russian jets or artillery - a maneuver that was tested in Syria, the ministry said.\n\nBut Russia will likely find it difficult to restock the drones, given the impact of sanctions on its domestic manufacturers, the ministry warned, and a shortage would degrade its ability to gather intelligence and conduct surveillance. Ukraine's intact air-defense missile systems have also managed to deter Russian aircraft from conducting sorties over Ukrainian-held territory, it added.\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Volodymyr Zelensky warned Saturday that only a diplomatic breakthrough rather than an outright military victory could end Russia's war on his country, as Moscow cut gas supplies to Finland.\n\nAfter just over 12 weeks of fierce fighting, Ukrainian forces have halted Russian attempts to seize Kyiv and the northern city of Kharkiv, but are under renewed and intense pressure in the eastern Donbas region.\n\nMoscow's army have flattened and seized the southeastern port city of Mariupol and subjected Ukrainian troops and towns in the east to a remorseless ground and artillery attack.\n\nZelensky's Western allies have shipped modern weaponry to his forces and imposed sweeping sanctions on the Russian economy and President Vladimir Putin's inner circle.\n\nBut the Kremlin has responded by disrupting European energy supplies, and on Saturday cut off gas shipments to Finland, which angered Moscow by applying to join the NATO alliance.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Zelensky told Ukrainian television the war would end \"through diplomacy\".\n\nThe conflict, he warned, \"will be bloody, there will be fighting but will only definitively end through diplomacy\".\n\nOn order to side-step financial sanctions and force European energy clients to prop up his central bank, Putin has demanded that importers from \"unfriendly countries\" pay for gas in rubles.\n\nRussian energy giant Gazprom said it had halted supplies to neighbouring Finland as it had not received ruble payments from Finland's state-owned energy company Gasum by the end of Friday.\n\nGazprom supplied 1.49 billion cubic metres of natural gas to Finland in 2021, about two thirds of the country's gas consumption but only eight percent of its total energy use.\n\nGasum said it would make up for the shortfall from other sources, through the Balticconnector pipeline, which links Finland to Estonia, a fellow European Union member.\n\nMoscow cut off gas to Poland and Bulgaria last month in a move the European Union described as \"blackmail\", but importers in some other EU countries more dependent on Russian gas plan to open ruble accounts with Gazprom's bank.\n\nFinland and neighbouring Sweden this week broke their historical military non-alignment and applied to join NATO, after public support for the alliance soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMoscow has warned Finland that joining NATO would be \"a grave mistake with far-reaching consequences\" and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said it would respond by building military bases in western Russia.\n\nBut both Finland and Sweden are now apparently on the fast track to join the military alliance, with US President Joe Biden this week offering \"full, total, complete backing\" to their bids.\n\nAll 30 existing NATO members must agree on any new entrants, and Turkey has condemned Sweden's alleged toleration of Kurdish militants, but diplomats are confident of avoiding a veto.\n\nDmytro Mosur, 32,

since 2014.\n\n\"They completely ruined Rubizhne, Vonokvakha, just as they did Mariupol,\" Zelensky said Friday, adding that the Russians were \"trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities\".\n\nIn Severodonetsk, a frontline city now at risk of encirclement, 12 people were killed and another 40 wounded by Russian shelling, the regional governor said.\n\nZelensky described the bombardment of Severodonetsk as \"brutal and absolutely pointless\", as residents cowering in basements described an unending ordeal of terror.\n\nThe city forms part of the last pocket of Ukrainian resistance in Lugansk, which along with the neighbouring region of Donetsk comprises the Donbas war zone.\n\nOn Friday, Moscow said the battle for the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol -- a symbol of

The defenders are even focusing on retaking some key areas nearer the Russian border, while Moscow is seeing its troops beaten back in a few key battles.Western aid is also flowing into Ukraine, NATO is set to be strengthened as countries seek to join, and the first Russian soldier accused of war crimes has stood trial.Here's what has happened in several key areas since the war began.Read MoreDonbas After weeks of intense fighting, Ukraine's eastern Donbas region is \"completely destroyed,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday. He accused Russia of a \"deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible\" after a village in Chernihiv was hit with missiles, leaving many dead.Officials in the region say the front line is being shelled \"day and night,\" with Russian forces attempting to break through Ukrainian lines. A NATO military official told CNN Wednesday that the alliance expects something of a stalemate over the next few weeks. But the official said NATO believes momentum has shifted significantly in favor of Ukraine and the debate within NATO circles is now over whether it is possible for Kyiv to retake Crimea and the Donbas territories seized by Russia and Russian-backed separatists, respectively, in 2014.KharkivUkrainian forces have beaten back Russia's assaults in Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv, and advanced toward the border in several places north and east of the city.Ukrainian officials said last week they were liberating villages on the outskirts of the city. Their advances led to the symbolic and embarrassing expulsion of the Kremlin's forces back to their own border while posing the strategic threat of cutting Russia's supply lines into Ukraine and its forces further south in Donbas.Anastasia Paraskevova recently returned to her home in Kharkiv for the first time since fleeing the city two months ago. It had been under constant bombardment since then, until Russian forces were repelled.Paraskevova said overall the experience was good. \"The city was much more alive. People were walking the streets. And some shops were working. It felt like some life was back, much better than it was when I was here in March.\"KhersonEvery day, hundreds, or even thousands, of people are trying to flee the Russian-occupied region of Kherson in southern Ukraine.The city has been under Russian control since early in the invasion. Ukrainians are leaving for many reasons: to avoid being detained or to escape the heavy-handed actions of Russian forces, or because of the chronic shortages of medicine and other basics in Kherson, which fell under Russian control soon after the invasion.Last week, a convoy of about 1,000 vehicles tried to leave Kherson. The Russians ultimately let the convoy move in batches -- but only after holding it in one place for most of the day.MariupolMariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, finally fell to Russian forces after weeks of relentless bombardment. The city was the scene of some of the most intense fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. It was there that Russia carried out deadly strikes on a maternity ward and the bombing of a theater where hundreds of civilians had sought refuge from the violence.Mariupol became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance as its defenders held out at Azovstal, a sprawling steelworks plant where as many as 1,000 civilians had taken shelter at one point, with stocks of food and water dwindling.Ukraine's military announced late Monday that its forces had completed their \"combat mission\" at Azovstal, effectively ceding the city to Russian forces. On Friday, Ukraine ordered its forces to stop defending the plant.Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Friday that almost 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers have surrendered at Azovstal. CNN cannot independently verify that figure.With the city now almost fully under Russian control, there is concern that evidence of any potential war crimes -- like those allegedly committed in Bucha and Borodianka -- could be lost or destroyed. BuchaMore evidence of potential Russian war crimes is emerging in Bucha, the northern Ukrainian city near Kyiv, the capital. An investigation by The New York Times alleged that Russian paratroopers carried out summary executions of at least eight Ukrainian men in Bucha on March 4.Evidence of mass graves and civilian executions in the towns of Bucha and Borodianka has continued to emerge since early April, following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Kyiv region.Images of bodies lying strewn the streets of Bucha have sparked international condemnation and fueled calls for an investigation into potential Russian war crimes.CNN visited the scene of mass graves in Bucha in April after Russian forces had withdrawn, revealing the horrors of their occupation to the world. Correspondent Fred Pleitgen was among the first to reach a mass grave that residents dug while the place was under Russian occupation, because so many residents had been killed and longer burial ceremonies would have been too dangerous amid the shooting and shelling.A soldier stands trialThis week saw the start of the first war crimes trial in Ukraine since the invasion began. A 21-year-old Russian soldier named Vadim Shishimarin pleaded guilty to killing an unarmed 62-year-old man.The trial's first day was so packed with journalists that authorities in Kyiv were forced to move to bigger venue. It has since produced several dramatic moments, including a confrontation between the soldier and the victim's widow and testimony from Shishimarin himself.Speaking Friday, Shishimarin acknowledged he was responsible for the killing but was \"sorry and sincerely repents.\" \"I was nervous the moment it happened. I didn't want to kill. But it happened and I do not deny it,\" he said.Shishimarin's lawyer, Viktor Ovsyannikov, argued that while his client was guilty of killing, it was not murder.\"Shishimarin was in a state of stress caused by the combat situation and the pressure from his commander. Analysis of those circumstances allows me to conclude that Shishimarin had no direct intent for the murder,\" Ovsyannikov said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that Russia has no details about Shishimarin's case and it considers the charges \"unacceptable,\" \"outrageous\" and \"staged.\" Diplomats returnForeign diplomatic missions started coming back to life in Kyiv this week, after diplomats fled the city en masse at the beginning of the conflict. The US flag was raised over the United States Embassy to mark the official resumption operations on Wednesday, while the Swiss Foreign Ministry said Thursday it would also reopen its embassy. The US and France both began sending back diplomats to Kyiv in late April. A massive aid packageUS lawmakers passed a bill Thursday that will send roughly $40 billion to Ukraine to pay for military and humanitarian aid, including funding that will assist Ukrainian military and national security forces, help replenish stores of US equipment sent to Ukraine and provide public health and medical support for Ukrainian refugees.US President Joseph Biden signed the aid package while he was in South Korea. Nordic developmentsRussia stopped sending natural gas to Finland Saturday, just days after it and Sweden applied to join NATO.Helsinki and Stockholm had, for decades, avoided joining the alliance, but cited Moscow's invasion as the ultimate impetus to do so now. The two countries formally handed in their applications Wednesday.Most NATO members appear ready to support both bids, except for Turkey.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday that his country \"will say no to Sweden's and Finland's entry into NATO,\" citing their support for the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The PKK seeks an independent state in Turkey and has been in an armed struggle with Ankara for decades. It has been designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.Some experts say Erdogan may be angling for concessions or to highlight grievances Turkey wishes to bring to the attention of the international community.\n\nCNN's Rob Picheta contributed to this article.", "source": {"uri": "edition.cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_berlinger@edition.cnn.com", "name": "Joshua Berlinger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220519200215-donbas-0519-super-tease.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 17, "stanza_neu": 50, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 69, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049454170", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "10:49:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T10:49:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T10:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5372549295425415, "url": "https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-crisis/zelenskyy-says-ukrainian-troops-from-azovstal-must-return-home-as-part-of-prisoners-swap-articleshow.html", "title": "Zelenskyy says Ukrainian troops from Azovstal must return home as part of prisoners swap", "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated on May 21 that Ukrainian troops from Azovstal must return home as part of a prisoner exchange. Zelenskyy stated at a press conference that the Mariupol defenders who were withdrawn from the Azovstal plant, which had been blocked by Russian troops, should be exchanged, European Pravda reported.\n\nZelenskyy stated that he had asked the leaders of other countries \"dozens or hundreds of times\" for weapons to help Mariupol and its defenders. However, as military means were ineffective, Ukraine was forced to rely on diplomacy. It is worth noting here that Russian troops blocked Mariupol on March 1. Mariupol defenders have been stalled at the Azovstal plant since the end of April.\n\nFollowing a nearly three-month siege that reduced much of the Mariupol to a smouldering ruin, Russia claimed to have taken the important port city on May 20 in what would be the biggest triumph in its war with Ukraine. Russia also appeared to start a big offensive in the Donbas province of Luhansk to grab the last remaining Ukrainian-held territory. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy sought a formal deal with Ukraine's allies to compensate Russia for the damage its forces committed during the war.\n\nAccording to Zelenskyy, Russia is seeking to destroy as much of Ukraine's infrastructure as possible, and a pact like this would show countries considering aggressive acts that they will be held accountable. The Ukrainian president further added that, such a pact would result in Russian funds and property being confiscated in signatory countries.\n\nHe said, in a video address, \"We invite partner countries to sign a multilateral agreement and create a mechanism ensuring that everybody who suffered from Russian actions can receive compensation for all losses incurred.\"\n\nAs the brutal war entered day 87, Russia intensified its offensive to take Ukrainian territory for separatists. On May 21, Russian forces shelled a riverside city in what appeared to be the start of a major offensive to retake the last remaining Ukrainian-held territory in a province it claims for separatists. Russian soldiers started a major artillery barrage against Sievierodonetsk, one of the last Ukrainian-held bastions in Luhansk, one of two southeastern provinces Moscow and its proxies describe as sovereign states, according to Ukrainian officials.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/zacd5dcaaedmnayv_1653129678.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 6, "stanza_neu": 8, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 15, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049091824", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "02:09:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T02:09:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T01:59:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5372549295425415, "url": "https://americanmilitarynews.com/2022/05/russian-bombardment-has-turned-ukraines-donbas-into-hell-zelenskyy-says/", "title": "Russian bombardment has turned Ukraine's Donbas into 'hell,' Zelenskyy says", "body": "With its grip tightened along the southern coast, Russia redoubled its assault on Ukraine's Donbas region Friday, turning parts of the country's eastern industrial heartland into \"hell,\" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.\n\nAt least a dozen people were killed and scores of homes destroyed in the area of Severodonetsk, regional Gov. Serhiy Haidai said on social media, an assertion that could not be independently verified. Severodonetsk is the easternmost point of the Donbas still in Ukrainian hands after 12 weeks of the current war and a longer fight in the region, dating back to 2014, between pro-Kyiv forces and Moscow-backed secessionists.\n\nThe nearby city of Lysychansk also came under sustained fire, the Ukrainian military's General Staff said, adding that its troops had repelled a series of attacks in the Donbas over the last 24 hours, destroying 14 armored vehicles and shooting down a Russian drone.\n\nDespite those battlefield successes, the growing war of attrition has exacted a grievous toll on civilians and infrastructure, with people killed or maimed, houses pulverized and power cut off in hard-hit communities.\n\n\"It is hell there, and that's not an exaggeration,\" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation.\n\nHe condemned a missile strike on the northeastern village of Desna, in which many residents were reported killed, as another example of attempted \"genocide\" by Russia. \"It is a conscious and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible, to destroy more homes, public sites, businesses,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nTo bolster Ukraine's defense, the U.S. Senate approved $40 billion in new aid for Kyiv on Thursday, sending the package to President Joe Biden for his promised signature. In addition, Germany's finance minister said Friday that the Group of 7 leading industrialized nations would allocate $19.8 billion for Kyiv, as part of what the G-7 declared was its commitment \"to our united response to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and to our unwavering support to Ukraine.\"\n\nWestern materiel and humanitarian assistance have been crucial to Ukraine's ability to defy an enemy whose military might, both in personnel and weaponry, dwarfs its own.\n\n\"This is a demonstration of strong leadership and a necessary contribution to our common defense of freedom,\" Zelenskyy said of the new U.S. pledge.\n\nBut the Kremlin has warned of reprisals against those rallying behind Ukraine and siding with the West. On Friday, Finland's state-owned natural gas wholesaler, Gasum, said Russia's Gazprom had announced that it would halt supplies to the Finnish company starting Saturday.\n\nThe cutoff comes just a few days after Helsinki submitted its application to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a move that ends decades of official military nonalignment and incenses Moscow. Last month, Gazprom also shut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria over their refusal to pay for the gas in rubles, which would help prop up the beleaguered Russian currency, instead of in the dollars or euros specified under contract.\n\nGasum Chief Executive Mika Wiljanen told customers that the company had \"been carefully preparing for this situation\" and should be able to keep the pipelines running.\n\nRegardless of Russian retaliation, whether the increased allied aid to Kyiv can turn the tide of the war, which Ukrainian officials acknowledge has entered a \"protracted phase,\" remains to be seen. With the conquest of Mariupol, the southeastern port city that Russian forces have essentially blown to bits, Moscow now controls access to the Sea of Azov and to land extending to the Crimean peninsula, which the Kremlin illegally annexed eight years ago.\n\nThat has had disastrous effects on Ukraine's economy, particularly its ability to ship out the grain that many Ukrainians rely on for their livelihood and millions around the world depend on for food. The loss in trade and the costs of prosecuting the war have contributed to an enormous budget deficit of $5 billion a month for Kyiv, officials say. And reduced exports and rising prices for wheat have worsened food insecurity in countries uninvolved in the conflict, such as Egypt and Pakistan.\n\nAt a United Nations Security Council meeting Thursday to address the crisis, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said the food supply for millions of people worldwide was being \"held hostage by the Russian military.\" Moscow called the accusation a lie. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was trying to negotiate a plan to move Ukrainian food exports out through the Black Sea.\n\nValeriy Zaluzhny, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, told journalists that his troops have so far managed to keep the key Black Sea port of Mykolaiv, west of Crimea, under Ukrainian control.\n\nThey are also pushing southeast toward Kherson, the first city to fall after the war began Feb. 24, amid growing signs that Russia is planning to annex parts of the region, including the city of Melitopol, where Moscow is reportedly introducing the use of the ruble in place of the Ukrainian hryvnia.\n\nFears remain high for the Ukrainian soldiers captured in Mariupol, who Moscow says number nearly 2,000. Kyiv has declined to give a precise figure. Transferred to a penal camp in Russian-controlled territory, many are severely injured and face a backlash from Russian soldiers and politicians, who have branded the Azov regiment as \"Nazis\" deserving trial and punishment.\n\nThe International Red Cross says it has registered as prisoners of war hundreds of troops evacuated from the massive Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, where the city's defenders made a long and bloody final stand.\n\nEarlier this week, the government in Kyiv said it was giving up the fight for the devastated city, but a band of diehard soldiers remains holed up in the plant. In a video statement Friday, the Azov regiment's commander, Maj. Denys Prokopenko, said efforts were still underway to remove the bodies of those who died trying to defend the facility.\n\nProkopenko echoed the Ukrainian government's order to the remaining fighters to \"cease the defense of the city.\" Despite their valiant attempts to hold out, the goal now was to \"save lives and health of the servicemen of the garrison,\" he said.\n\nCompleting its takeover of Mariupol allows Russia to continue moving troops to the Donbas, now the focus of its offensive after its failure to capture Kyiv or the northeastern city of Kharkiv. But having been tied up so long in Mariupol and suffered losses, the forces there \"must be re-equipped and refurbished before they can be redeployed effectively,\" which can be a lengthy process, Britain's Ministry of Defense said in its daily assessment of the war.\n\nThe Russian military brass is feeling the heat from President Vladimir Putin for falling well short of his goals for the so-called special military operation in Ukraine. To try to notch more successes quickly, \"Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition,\" the British assessment said.\n\nLondon said earlier that a number of senior commanders had already been relieved of their posts, including Lt. Gen. Serhiy Kisel, whose fighters were unable to subdue Kharkiv. Vice Adm. Igor Osipov, the head of Russia's Black Sea fleet, has also likely been suspended following the sinking of the flagship cruiser Moskva last month, a stunning victory for Ukraine that was aided by U.S.-provided intelligence.\n\n\"A culture of cover-ups and scapegoating is probably prevalent within the Russian military and security system,\" the British Ministry of Defense said. \"Many officials involved in the invasion of Ukraine will likely be increasingly distracted by efforts to avoid personal culpability for Russia's operational setbacks.\"", "source": {"uri": "americanmilitarynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Military News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_j_mcdonnell@americanmilitarynews.com", "name": "Patrick J.

country, as Moscow cut gas supplies to Finland.\n\nAfter just over 12 weeks of fierce fighting, Ukrainian forces have halted Russian attempts to seize Kyiv and the northern city of Kharkiv, but are under renewed and intense pressure in the eastern Donbas region.\n\nMoscow's army have flattened and seized the southeastern port city of Mariupol and subjected Ukrainian troops and towns in the east to a remorseless ground and artillery attack.\n\nZelensky's Western allies have shipped modern weaponry to his forces and imposed sweeping sanctions on the Russian economy and President Vladimir Putin's inner circle.\n\nBut the Kremlin has responded by disrupting European energy supplies, and on Saturday cut off gas shipments to Finland, which angered Moscow by applying to join the NATO alliance.\n\n- 'It will be bloody' -\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Zelensky told Ukrainian television the war would end \"through diplomacy\".\n\nThe conflict, he warned, \"will be bloody, there will be fighting but will only definitively end through diplomacy\".\n\nOn order to side-step financial sanctions and force European energy clients to prop up his central bank, Putin has demanded that importers from \"unfriendly countries\" pay for gas in rubles.\n\nRussian energy giant Gazprom said it had halted supplies to neighbouring Finland as it had not received ruble payments from Finland's state-owned energy company Gasum by the end of Friday.\n\nGazprom supplied 1.49 billion cubic metres of natural gas to Finland in 2021, about two thirds of the country's gas consumption but only eight percent of its total energy use.\n\nGasum said it would make up for the shortfall from other sources, through the Balticconnector pipeline, which links Finland to Estonia, a fellow European Union member.\n\nMoscow cut off gas to Poland and Bulgaria last month in a move the European Union described as \"blackmail\", but importers in some other EU countries more dependent on Russian gas plan to open ruble accounts with Gazprom's bank.\n\nFinland and neighbouring Sweden this week broke their historical military non-alignment and applied to join NATO, after public support for the alliance soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n- 'Grave mistake' -\n\nMoscow has warned Finland that joining NATO would be \"a grave mistake with far-reaching consequences\" and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said it would respond by building military bases in western Russia.\n\nBut both Finland and Sweden are now apparently on the fast track to join the military alliance, with US President Joe Biden this week offering \"full, total, complete backing\" to their bids.\n\nAll 30 existing NATO members must agree on any new entrants, and Turkey has condemned Sweden's alleged toleration of Kurdish militants, but diplomats are confident of avoiding a veto.\n\nOn the ground in Ukraine, the fighting is fiercest in the eastern region of Donbas, a Russian-speaking area that has been partially controlled by pro-Kremlin separatists since 2014.\n\n\"They completely ruined Rubizhne, Vonokvakha, just as they did Mariupol,\" Zelensky said Friday, adding that the Russians were \"trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities\".\n\nIn Severodonetsk, a frontline city now at risk of encirclement, 12 people were killed and another 40 wounded by Russian shelling, the regional governor said.\n\n- 'End of the operation' -\n\nZelensky described the bombardment of Severodonetsk as \"brutal and absolutely pointless\", as residents cowering in basements described an unending ordeal of terror.\n\nThe city forms part of the last pocket of Ukrainian resistance in Lugansk, which along with the neighbouring region of Donetsk comprises the Donbas war zone.\n\nOn Friday, Moscow said the battle for the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol -- a symbol of Ukraine's dogged resistance since Putin launched the invasion on February 24 -- was now over.\n\nRussian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenko said 2,439 Ukrainian personnel had surrendered at the steelworks since May 16, the final 500 on Friday.\n\nUkraine hopes to exchange the surrendering Azovstal

The ministry also said that 771 soldiers from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol had surrendered in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe ministry promised medical treatment in hospitals in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Novoazovsk for those in need of it. Russia's recent statements have not yet been confirmed by Ukraine.\n\nHowever, that total suggests that around 300 Azov soldiers may have remained behind in the metal works, according to earlier headcount tallies.\n\nRussia scored a major PR and tactical victory when the bulk of the force that has been besieged in the plant in the destroyed industrial port city surrendered earlier this week.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that the heroes were more valuable to Ukraine alive than dead. The fighters, including 80 wounded, gave themselves up and were bussed to internment camps in Russian held territory.\n\n\"A difficult day. But this day, like all others, is aimed at saving our country and our people. I want to emphasise that Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive,\" Zelenskiy said in a night-time address.\n\nThe fate of the POWs remains unclear. One Russian MP has already called for them to be put on trial for war crimes. A similar war crimes trial got underway in Kyiv a day earlier. Vadim Shishimarin admitted shooting a 62-year-old man a few days after the invasion began and faces life in jail if convicted.\n\nThe Russian occupation authorities also announced that now Mariupol and the Azovstal plant is under Russian control, they would destroy what is left and turn the city into a Black Sea leisure resort, the Institute for the Study of War reported.\n\n\"That would deprive Russia of some of the most important economic benefits it hoped to reap by taking the city in the first place,\" the ISW said in a tweet.\n\n\"This announcement directly undermines the large strategic economic importance of capturing the plant and epitomises the kind of Pyrrhic victories Russian forces have won in Ukraine, to the extent that they have won victories at all,\" the ISW added.\n\nAzovstal was a major anchor for the local economy, employing some 10,000 workers and bringing in billions of dollars in foreign exchange earnings for the country as well as significant taxes for the municipality as a full-cycle metallurgical complex owned by Ukraine's richest man, Rinat Akhmetov.\n\nThe head of the Russian backed Donetsk People's Republic Denis Pushilin also said that 60% of the structures in Mariupol have been destroyed in the fighting and the city is now in a state where it can't be rebuilt, so the authorities intend to clear it of rubble and replace it with a resort town.\n\nElsewhere the tide seems to have turned in Russia's favour in the last days. While Ukrainian troops have managed to push Russian forces back to the border this week, in the last day Russia has made advances again and its forces are close to surrounding Ukrainian forces in the village of Popasna, according to reports.\n\nRussians are also trying to cut the Lysychansk-Bakhmut highway, a key supply route, and isolate the Luhansk region, the head of the regional administration, reports Neil Hauer, bne IntelliNews' correspondent in Donbas.\n\n\"Russian forces have pushed forward from Popasna and now sit 15 km from Bakhmut, 10 km from Soledar. Videos of Russian troop concentrations suggest Popasna direction is main Russian thrust currently,\" Hauer reports.\n\n\"Ukraine is having success with its Kharkiv offensive. But the sense in Donbas is that the situation is deteriorating significantly - and that this has accelerated in recent days. Russian troops have advanced on several axes in the past 24 hours and there's an ominous feeling here,\" Hauer said in a tweet a day earlier.\n\n\"Ukrainian forces in the Donbas might be close to breaking point,\" Anatoly Karlin, a well-known Russia blogger, added. \"If so, Russian gains will accelerate in the coming days.\"", "source": {"uri": "intellinews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Intellinews                        "}, "authors": [], "image": "http://d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_desktop/s3/articleimages/bnePeople_Ukraine_Azov_regiment's_deputy_commander_Sviatoslav_\"Kalyna\"_Palamar_Cropped_(1).jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 8, "stanza_neu": 25, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 33, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7048869102", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "19:55:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T19:55:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T19:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5372549295425415, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/russian-army-takes-control-of-mariupols-azovstal-steel-plant", "title": "Russian army takes control of Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant", "body": "Last group of Ukrainian soldiers have now surrendered according to Russian defence minister\n\nThe last group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the smashed Azovstal steel works has surrendered, Russia's defence ministry said late on Friday, marking an end to the three-month siege of the defenders' last stronghold in Mariupol.\n\n\"Underground structures of Azovstal where militants were hiding are now under full control of Russian armed forces,\" the ministry said in a statement, adding that in total 2,439 Ukrainian fighters have surrendered.\n\nDefence minister Sergei Shoigu has told President Vladimir Putin that both Mariupol and the steel plant have been \"fully liberated\", it said.\n\nPro-Kremlin telegram channels also released a video with Sergei Volynsky, the commander of the 36th Marine Brigade unit, in which he said that his unit has surrendered.

partially controlled by pro-Kremlin separatists since 2014.\n\n\"They completely ruined Rubizhne, Vonokvakha, just as they did Mariupol,\" Zelensky said Friday, adding that the Russians were \"trying

invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMoscow has warned Finland that joining NATO would be \"a grave mistake with far-reaching consequences\" and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said it would respond by building military bases in western Russia.\n\nBut both Finland and Sweden are now apparently on the fast track to join the military alliance, with US President Joe Biden this week offering \"full, total, complete backing\" to their bids.\n\nAll 30 existing NATO members must agree on any new entrants, and Turkey has condemned Sweden's alleged toleration of Kurdish militants, but diplomats are confident of avoiding a veto.\n\nOn the ground in Ukraine, the fighting is fiercest in the eastern region of Donbas, a Russian-speaking area that has been partially controlled by pro-Kremlin separatists since 2014.\n\n\"They completely ruined Rubizhne, Vonokvakha, just as they did Mariupol,\" Zelensky said Friday, adding that the Russians were \"trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities\".\n\nIn Severodonetsk, a frontline city now at risk of encirclement, 12 people were killed and another 40 wounded by Russian shelling, the regional governor said.\n\nZelensky described the bombardment of Severodonetsk as \"brutal and absolutely pointless\", as residents cowering in basements described an unending ordeal of terror.\n\nThe city forms part of the last pocket of Ukrainian resistance in Lugansk, which along with the neighbouring region of Donetsk comprises the Donbas war zone.\n\nOn Friday, Moscow said the battle for the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol -- a symbol of Ukraine's dogged resistance since Putin launched the invasion on February 24 -- was now over.\n\nRussian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenko said 2,439 Ukrainian personnel had surrendered at the steelworks since May 16, the final 500 on Friday.\n\nUkraine hopes to exchange the surrendering Azovstal soldiers for Russian prisoners. But in Donetsk, pro-Kremlin authorities are threatening to put some of them on trial.\n\nBiden has cast the Ukraine war as part of a US-led struggle pitting democracy against authoritarianism.\n\nThe US Congress this week approved a $40-billion (38-billion-euro) aid package, including funds to enhance Ukraine's armoured vehicle fleet and air defence system.\n\nAnd, meeting in Germany, G7 industrialised nations pledged $19.8 billion to shore up Ukraine's shattered public finances.\n\nWhile the invasion has ebbed around the northeastern city of Kharkiv, it remains in Russian artillery range, and hundreds of people are refusing to leave the relative safety of its metro system.\n\n\"We're tired.

Russian shelling in Luhansk, also in the Donbas, has killed 13 civilians over the past 24 hours, regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said.

Since turning away from Ukraine's capital, Russia is using massed artillery and armor to try to capture more territory in the Donbas, comprised of the Donetsk and Luhansk areas, which Moscow claims on behalf of separatists.\n\n\"The occupiers are trying to exert even more pressure. It is hell there -- and that is not an exaggeration,\" Zelenskiy said in an address on Thursday night. There were also \"constant strikes\" on the Odesa region in the south, he said. \"The Donbas is completely destroyed,\" he said.\n\nMoscow calls its invasion a \"special military operation\" to rid Ukraine of fascists, an assertion Kyiv and its Western allies say is a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war. Russia is likely to reinforce its operations Donbas region once it secures the southern port city of Mariupol, scene of a weeks-long siege, British military intelligence said.\n\nAs the invasion nears the three-month mark, the U.S. Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly approved nearly $40 billion in new aid for Ukraine, by far the largest U.S. aid package to date. The Group of Seven rich nations also agreed to provide Ukraine with $18.4 billion. Ukraine said the money would speed up victory over Russia and was just as important as \"the weapons you provide\".\n\nThe White House is working to put advanced anti-ship missiles in the hands of Ukrainian fighters to help defeat Russia's naval blockade, officials said.

Shoigu, had informed President Vladimir V. Putin of the \"complete liberation\" of the Mariupol steel plant where Ukrainian fighters had made their last stand in the city before surrendering in recent days. Ukrainian officials have not confirmed the Russian claim.\n\nThe Ukrainian military, for its part, said that in the past day it had repulsed 11 attacks in the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, collectively known as the Donbas region, and had destroyed eight tanks as well as other Russian combat vehicles.\n\nOverall, Mr. Zelensky asserted, Ukraine has \"broken the backbone of the largest, or one of the strongest, armies in the world.\"\n\nThe war is now set to enter its fourth month, and while Moscow has been forced to retreat first from outside the capital, Kyiv, and more recently from the country's second-largest city, Kharkiv, neither side is currently making more than incremental gains.\n\nWith the conflict coming ever closer to a stalemate and both sides fighting in the Donbas region to gain the upper hand, calls for a cease-fire have grown louder, along with questions about what would constitute victory, or at least a suitable outcome, for Ukraine.\n\n\"A cease-fire must be achieved as soon as possible,\" the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, urged on Thursday, opening a parliamentary debate on Italy's role in backing Ukraine. He added that \"we have to bring Moscow to the negotiating table.\"\n\nGerman, French and Italian suggestions of a cease-fire have been rejected angrily and even bitterly by Kyiv as selfish and poorly timed. Ukrainian officials say that Russia is hardly ready for serious peace talks and that their forces -- despite considerable losses in the Donbas and in Mariupol -- have the momentum in the war.\n\nFor now, some in Ukraine are insisting that the only outcome it will abide is the restoration of all territory lost to Russia since 1991, when it gained independence from the Soviet Union. That would include both the Donbas in its entirety and Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. But Mr. Zelensky has hinted that he would accept the status quo ante before the war.\n\nWestern diplomats maintain that this is a matter for Ukraine to decide. But their unanimity begins to break down when it turns to specifics.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, Julianne Smith, speaking at a conference in Warsaw, restated the United States' firm support of Ukraine. \"In terms of the end state,\" she added, \"we believe we will see Ukraine prevail, and we want them to protect their territorial integrity and their sovereignty.\"\n\nBut she added another objective: \"We want to see a strategic defeat of Russia. We want to see Russia leave Ukraine.\"\n\nFor Eastern European and Baltic leaders, a durable peace settlement and an end to the conflict has to include a crushing military victory that spells an end to Mr. Putin's presidency. Anything short of his departure would merely pave the way for the next war, they say. They balk at suggestions from Berlin, Paris and Rome to lure Mr. Putin back to the negotiating table.\n\n\"Peace can't be the ultimate goal,\" Prime Minister Kaja Kallas of Estonia recently told The New York Times. \"I only see a solution as a military victory that could end this once and for all, and also punishing the aggressor for what he has done.\"\n\nOtherwise, she said, \"we go back to where we started -- you will have a pause of one year, two years, and then everything will continue.\"\n\n\"All these events should wake us from our geopolitical slumber, and cause us to cast off our delusions,\" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland said on Thursday at the Warsaw conference. \"I hear there are attempts to allow Putin to somehow save face in the international arena. But how can you save something that has been utterly disfigured?\"\n\n\"Russia can only be deterred by our unity, military capabilities and hard sanctions,\" he added. \"Not by phone calls and conversations with Putin.\"\n\nIn a diplomatic salvo of its own, Russia's Foreign Ministry on Saturday released a list of 963 people who would be barred for life from entering Russia, among them Mr. Biden, the actor Morgan Freeman and the New York Times columnist Bret Stephens. The ministry described its move as \"necessary\" retaliation against the \"hostile actions\" of the United States.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of an unfolding debate about what a final settlement might look like, Russian and Ukrainian forces dug in on the battlefield, conscious that every military victory would turn into a diplomatic advantage.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said on Saturday that Russia was demining the port of Mariupol in an attempt to get it running again. Reopening the port would tighten Moscow's control over the parts of southern and eastern Ukraine that it controls, as well as increase its economic leverage over the Black Sea, where its navy is dominant.\n\nAnd Russian forces have become entrenched in areas outside of the city of Kharkiv, presenting a formidable obstacle to any Ukrainian efforts to press their advantage in that area.\n\nRussia's military prepared on Saturday to attempt another pontoon crossing of an eastern Ukrainian river that has posed a formidable barrier to its aims in the region, Ukraine's military said, despite suffering one of its single most lethal engagements of the war in a previous attempt this month.\n\nRussian forces were staging bridging equipment again near the Seversky Donets River, the Ukrainian military said in its regularly published morning assessment of the war. The stream's winding path cuts through the heart of the region where Russian forces are battling Ukrainian defenders -- around the cities of Izium, Sloviansk, Kramatorsk and Sievierodonetsk -- creating major obstacles to Moscow's offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"The enemy has not ceased offensive actions in the eastern operation zone with the goal of establishing full control over the territory of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions,\" the assessment said.\n\nUkraine's military has blown up bridges to force the Russians to build pontoon bridges, a tactic that has proved effective -- and costly for the Russian army. Military forces are particularly vulnerable to artillery strikes as they congregate soldiers, armored vehicles and equipment while attempting a crossing.\n\nIn the battle for control of the Donbas region, Russian forces have attempted several pontoon crossings of the Seversky Donets, seen as an important tactical step toward the goal of surrounding a pocket of Ukrainian troops in and around the city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nOn May 11, Ukrainian artillery struck a pontoon crossing with devastating effect, destroying the bridge, incinerating armored vehicles on both river banks and killing more than 400 soldiers, according to estimates by Western military analysts. The British Defense Ministry has issued statements corroborating the Ukrainian accounts, based on satellite imagery and aerial drone imagery posted online of the strike.\n\nWhatever the ultimate outcome of the war, no one expects it to end soon, as each country's leader needs to be able to claim some sort of victory, particularly Mr. Zelensky.\n\n\"For Zelensky, there is no other path forward than to continue to fight and reconquer the territory they lost,\" said Andrew A. Michta, a German-based foreign policy and defense analyst. \"The minute he agrees to any compromise, given the blood paid, he loses political credibility. The Ukrainians can't cut a deal just to stop the fighting, so this will be a long, drawn-out war.\"\n\nSteven Erlanger reported from Brussels, Andrew E.

Not a single large locality has been liberated.'\n\nGirkin said that perhaps some 'local tactical successes' could be achieved before a counter-offensive by Ukraine forces but said it was unlikely the Donbas region would be 'fully liberated', adding: 'It's likely the UAF will not even be pushed away from the outskirts of Donetsk.

Quite the opposite.'\n\nMeanwhile, Vladimir Putin finally deployed his 'Terminator' military vehicles in battle as Kyiv continues to obliterate invading Russian tanks with the help of British

Finland gas", "body": "Charlotte Plantive, with Dmitry Zaks in Severodonetsk and Patrick Fort in Kharkiv\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Saturday that only a diplomatic breakthrough rather than an outright military victory could end Russia's war on his country, as Moscow cut gas supplies to Finland.\n\nAfter just over 12 weeks of fierce fighting, Ukrainian forces have halted Russian attempts to seize Kyiv and the northern city of Kharkiv, but are under renewed and intense pressure in the eastern Donbas region.\n\nMoscow's army have flattened and seized the southeastern port city of Mariupol and subjected Ukrainian troops and towns in the east to a remorseless ground and artillery attack.\n\nZelensky's Western allies have shipped modern weaponry to his forces and imposed sweeping sanctions on the Russian economy and President Vladimir Putin's inner circle.\n\nBut the Kremlin has responded by disrupting European energy supplies, and on Saturday cut off gas shipments to Finland, which angered Moscow by applying to join the NATO alliance.\n\n- 'It will be bloody' -\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Zelensky told Ukrainian television the war would end \"through diplomacy\".\n\nThe conflict, he warned, \"will be bloody, there will be fighting but will only definitively end through diplomacy\".\n\nOn order to side-step financial sanctions and force European energy clients to prop up his central bank, Putin has demanded that importers from \"unfriendly countries\" pay for gas in rubles.\n\nRussian energy giant Gazprom said it had halted supplies to neighbouring Finland as it had not received ruble payments from Finland's state-owned energy company Gasum by the end of Friday.\n\nGazprom supplied 1.49 billion cubic metres of natural gas to Finland in 2021, about two thirds of the country's gas consumption but only eight percent of its total energy use.\n\nGasum said it would make up for the shortfall from other sources, through the Balticconnector pipeline, which links Finland to Estonia, a fellow European Union member.\n\nMoscow cut off gas to Poland and Bulgaria last month in a move the European Union described as \"blackmail\", but importers in some other EU countries more dependent on Russian gas plan to open ruble accounts with Gazprom's bank.\n\nFinland and neighbouring Sweden this week broke their historical military non-alignment and applied to join NATO, after public support for the alliance soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n- 'Grave mistake' -\n\nMoscow has warned Finland that joining NATO would be \"a grave mistake with far-reaching consequences\" and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said it would respond by building military bases in western Russia.\n\nBut both Finland and Sweden are now apparently on the fast track to join the military alliance, with US President Joe Biden this week offering \"full, total, complete backing\" to their bids.\n\nAll 30 existing NATO members must agree on any new entrants, and Turkey has condemned Sweden's alleged toleration of Kurdish militants, but diplomats are confident of avoiding a veto.\n\nOn the ground in Ukraine, the fighting is fiercest in the eastern region of Donbas, a Russian-speaking area that has been partially controlled by pro-Kremlin separatists since 2014.\n\n\"They completely ruined Rubizhne, Vonokvakha, just as they did Mariupol,\" Zelensky said Friday, adding that the Russians were \"trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities\".\n\nIn Severodonetsk, a frontline city now at risk of encirclement, 12 people were killed and another 40 wounded by Russian shelling, the regional governor said.\n\n- 'End of the operation' -\n\nZelensky described the bombardment of Severodonetsk as \"brutal and absolutely pointless\", as residents cowering in basements described an unending ordeal of terror.\n\nThe city forms part of the last pocket of Ukrainian resistance in Lugansk, which along with the neighbouring region of Donetsk comprises the Donbas war zone.\n\nOn Friday, Moscow said the battle for the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol -- a symbol of Ukraine's dogged resistance since Putin launched the invasion on February 24 -- was now over.\n\nRussian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenko said 2,439 Ukrainian personnel had surrendered at the steelworks since May 16, the final 500 on Friday.\n\nUkraine hopes to exchange the surrendering Azovstal soldiers for Russian prisoners. But in Donetsk, pro-Kremlin authorities are threatening to put some of them on trial.\n\nBiden has cast the Ukraine war as part of a US-led struggle pitting democracy against authoritarianism.\n\nThe US Congress this week approved a $40-billion (38-billion-euro) aid package, including funds to enhance Ukraine's armoured vehicle fleet and air defence system.\n\nAnd, meeting in Germany, G7 industrialised nations pledged $19.8 billion to shore up Ukraine's shattered public finances.\n\n- Underground living -\n\nWhile the invasion has ebbed around the northeastern city of Kharkiv, it remains in Russian artillery range, and hundreds of people are refusing to leave the relative safety of its metro system.\n\n\"We're tired.

But there has been a skyrocketing increase in all forms of illegal trafficking of women and girls in the region - and also boys - including forced sex and labor, prostitution, pornography and other forms of sexual exploitation, authorities and experts said.\n\n\"Collectively, the international community is starting to see indications that traffickers are preying on or attempting to prey on Ukrainians, and others that are fleeing Russia's war on Ukraine,\" Kari Johnstone, the State Department's top anti-human trafficking official, said in an exclusive interview.

International fears for Azovstal fighters taken prisoner\n\nRussia claimed to have captured Mariupol on Friday in what would be its biggest victory yet in its attack on Ukraine, after a nearly three-month siege that reduced much of the strategic port city to a smoking ruin, with more than 20,000 civilians feared dead.\n\nRussian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin the \"complete liberation\" of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol - the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance - and the city as a whole, spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. There was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine.\n\nRussia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the ministry as saying a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters who had been holed up at the steelworks had surrendered since Monday, including more than 500 on Friday.\n\nAs they surrendered, the troops were taken prisoner by the Russians, and at least some were taken to a former penal colony. Others were said to be hospitalised.\n\nRussian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the steel mill's defenders for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them \"Nazis\" and criminals. That has stirred international fears about their fate.\n\n3. Kyiv proposes formal deal on compensation from Russia\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has proposed a formal deal with the country's allies to secure Russian compensation for the damage its forces have caused during the war.\n\nMr Zelensky, who says Russia is trying to destroy as much of Ukraine's infrastructure as it can, said such a deal would show nations planning aggressive acts that they would have to pay for their actions.\n\n\"We invite partner countries to sign a multilateral agreement and create a mechanism ensuring that everybody who suffered from Russian actions can receive compensation for all losses incurred,\" he said in a video address.\n\nMr Zelensky said that under such a deal, Russian funds and property in signatory nations would be confiscated. They would then be directed to a special compensation fund: \"That would be fair. And Russia will feel the weight of every missile, every bomb, every shell which it has fired at us.\"\n\n4. Zelensky reveals secret operation to support Azovstal\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky has revealed a weeks-long mystery about the siege of the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol: How were supplies delivered to the steel mill's defenders?\n\nUkrainian pilots risked Russian anti-aircraft fire to fly medicine, food and water to the steel mill on helicopters, suffering a large amount of casualties, Mr Zelensky said in an interview published on Friday on the third anniversary of his inauguration as president. He said the effort also included retrieval of bodies and picking up the wounded.\n\nTo save what he called \"heroes\" holed up in the massive, ruined remains of the steel mill, \"a very large number of people, our pilots, were killed\" flying in on the operation.\n\n\"They are absolutely heroic people, who knew that it would be difficult, knew that to fly would be almost impossible,\" Mr Zelensky said.\n\nHe said the airlift couldn't be reported earlier because no safe air corridor to the plant had been established, and that powerful anti-aircraft weapons were in place.\n\n\"A great many weeks, pilots flew helicopters, knowing that there was a 90 per cent chance they wouldn't return,\" he said.\n\n5. Truss: We'll give Moldova weapons to stop Putin invading\n\nLiz Truss has revealed that she wants to send modern weaponry to Moldova to protect it from the threat of invasion by Russia.\n\nIn an interview with The Telegraph, the Foreign Secretary said Vladimir Putin was determined to create a \"greater Russia\" despite defeat in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital.\n\nMoldova, to the south-west of Ukraine, is not a Nato member and there are fears it could be Putin's next target after Ukraine as he seeks territorial expansion.\n\nMs Truss said talks were taking place about making sure that not only Ukraine but also Moldova's defences were \"Nato standard\" to deter any future attack.\n\nLiz Truss: We'll give Moldova weapons to stop an invasion by Vladimir Putin\n\nListen to the latest episode of our daily Ukraine podcast", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "roland_oliphant@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Roland Oliphant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "maighna_nanu@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Maighna Nanu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "james_kilner@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "James Kilner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ben_riley_smith@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Ben Riley-Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "con_coughlin@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Con Coughlin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2022/05/21/TELEMMGLPICT000296801865_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf_4Xpit_DMGvdp2n7FDd82k.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 35, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 47, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7047679588", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-19", "time": "23:56:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-19T23:56:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-19T23:56:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5254902243614197, "url": "https://www.spacewar.com/afp/220519225959.oia3zwxj.html", "title": "Ukraine steelworks troops surrender as Russian soldier says sorry", "body": "The number included 80 wounded who were taken to a hospital in Russia-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine, Moscow said.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry released a video appearing to show exhausted Ukrainian soldiers trudging out of the sprawling steelworks, after a weeks-long siege forced the defenders and civilians to huddle in tunnels, enduring dire shortages of food, water and medicine.\n\nRussian troops patted down those surrendering and inspected their bags as they left, signalling the effective end of what Ukraine's government had called a \"heroic\" resistance.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said it had registered \"hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war\" from the plant in Mariupol, a port city obliterated by Russian shelling.\n\nUkraine is hoping to exchange the Azovstal soldiers for Russian prisoners. But pro-Kremlin authorities in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region said some of them could be put on trial.\n\nThe United States warned Thursday it would be watching the situation closely.\n\n\"Our expectation is... that all prisoners of war will be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention and the law of war,\" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.\n\nUkraine has already begun its own

Kyiv.\n\nThe West's support for Kyiv stiffened further Thursday when a $40 billion aid package was approved by an unusually united US Congress.\n\nIt includes $6 billion earmarked for Ukraine to boost its armoured vehicle inventory and air defence system.\n\nGermany also said it would contribute one billion euros to shore up Ukrainian government coffers as G7 finance ministers met to coordinate

as a \"terrorist organisation\" by Turkey and Western allies such as the European Union -- which includes Finland and Sweden.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was \"addressing the concerns that Turkey has expressed\".\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed that remark, saying: \"If concerns are raised by any members of the alliance, they'll be addressed.\"\n\n\"I'm very confident that as this process moves forward, there will be a strong consensus for bringing both countries under the Alliance,\" he added.\n\nIn Finland, where previously

world.\n\n\"Malnutrition, mass hunger and famine\" could follow \"in a crisis that could last for years\", Guterres warned, urging Russia to release grain exports from occupied Ukraine.\n\nRussia and Ukraine produce 30 percent of the world's wheat supply, and the war has already sent food prices surging around the world.\n\nUkrainian presidential administration head Andriy Yermak said the squeeze on global staples was a deliberate ploy to weaken international resolve.\n\n\"Being unable to access nearly one-third of our croplands, the systematic destruction by Russian forces of Ukrainian agriculture and transport infrastructure, the blockade of our seaports -- these are part of Russia's strategy of exerting pressure on the international community,\" he said.\n\nDespite their

We're going to pull together with the resources that they need to get through this.'\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday Shmyhal had written on Twitter, \"Support of partners will speed up our victory... Despite Russia's efforts to destroy our economy, together we will win!\"\n\nFurther pledges of weapons also came on Thursday, as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday he has authorized $100 million in additional U.S. arms, equipment, and supplies for Ukraine.\n\nThe past week has seen Russia secure its biggest victory since the invasion began, with Kyiv announcing it had ordered its garrison in a steelworks in Mariupol to stand down, after a nearly three-month siege of the city.\n\nRussian forces have lost ground elsewhere, however, driven from northern Ukraine and the area around the capital at the end of March, and pushed this month from the outskirts of the second-largest city Kharkiv.\n\nIn Washington, U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday threw his support behind Sweden and Finland's bids to join NATO in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nFinland and Sweden's move reverses generations of military non-alignment and is the biggest shake-up in European security for decades.\n\nNATO member Turkey has objected, accusing the two Nordic states of harbouring Kurdish militants, but Biden and European leaders said they were confident Turkey's concerns could be addressed.\n\nBiden, hosting Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson and Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 at the White House, told reporters: \"I think we're going to be OK\".\n\nTurkey's President Tayyip Erdogan said late on Wednesday, \"We have told allies that we will say no to Finland and Sweden's NATO membership,\" adding, \"NATO is a security alliance and we cannot accept terrorists to be in it.\"\n\nNiinisto said Finland would commit to Turkey's security, adding, \"We condemn terrorism in all its forms and we are actively engaged in combating it.\"\n\nThe ultimate outcome of the bloodiest battle in Europe for decades has remained unclear, with no confirmation of the fate of hundreds of Ukrainian defenders. Moscow said on Thursday that 1,730 Ukrainian fighters had surrendered so far, including 771 in the past 24 hours.\n\nUkraine, which says it aims to secure a prisoner swap, has not said how many were inside the plant or commented on the fate of the rest since confirming that just over 250 had surrendered in the initial hours after it ordered them to yield.\n\nThe Switzerland-based International Committee of the Red Cross said it has registered hundreds of prisoners from the plant now held by Russia, but it has not given a precise number.\n\nThe leader of Russian-backed separatists in control of the area said nearly half of the fighters remained inside the steelworks, where underground bunkers and tunnels had protected them from weeks of Russian bombardment.\n\n\"More than half have laid down their arms,\" Denis Pushilin told the Solovyov Live internet television channel. \"Let them surrender, let them live, let them honestly face the charges for all their crimes.\"\n\nThe wounded were given medical treatment while those who were fit were taken to a penal colony and were being treated well, he said. Ukrainian officials say they cannot comment publicly on their fate while negotiations are under way to rescue them.\n\nRussia denies it agreed to a prisoner swap.

NATO Bid", "body": "Russia-Ukraine War: Russian energy giant Gazprom said it had halted supplies to Finland.\n\nMoscow:\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Saturday that only a diplomatic breakthrough rather than an outright military victory could end Russia's war on his country, as Moscow cut gas supplies to Finland.\n\nAfter just over 12 weeks of fierce fighting, Ukrainian forces have halted Russian attempts to seize Kyiv and the northern city of Kharkiv, but are under renewed and intense pressure in the eastern Donbas region.\n\nMoscow's army have flattened and seized the southeastern port city of Mariupol and subjected Ukrainian troops and towns in the east to a remorseless ground and artillery attack.\n\nZelensky's Western allies have shipped modern weaponry to his forces and imposed sweeping sanctions on the Russian economy and President Vladimir Putin's inner circle.\n\nBut the Kremlin has responded by disrupting European energy supplies, and on Saturday cut off gas shipments to Finland, which angered Moscow by applying to join the NATO alliance.\n\n'It will be bloody'\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Zelensky told Ukrainian television the war would end \"through diplomacy\".\n\nThe conflict, he warned, \"will be bloody, there will be fighting but will only definitively end through diplomacy\".\n\nOn order to side-step financial sanctions and force European energy clients to prop up his central bank, Putin has demanded that importers from \"unfriendly countries\" pay for gas in rubles.\n\nRussian energy giant Gazprom said it had halted supplies to neighbouring Finland as it had not received ruble payments from Finland's state-owned energy company Gasum by the end of Friday.\n\nGazprom supplied 1.49 billion cubic metres of natural gas to Finland in 2021, about two thirds of the country's gas consumption but only eight percent of its total energy use.\n\nGasum said it would make up for the shortfall from other sources, through the Balticconnector pipeline, which links Finland to Estonia, a fellow European Union member.\n\nMoscow cut off gas to Poland and Bulgaria last month in a move the European Union described as \"blackmail\", but importers in some other EU countries more dependent on Russian gas plan to open ruble accounts with Gazprom's bank.\n\nFinland and neighbouring Sweden this week broke their historical military non-alignment and applied to join NATO, after public support for the alliance soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n'Grave mistake'\n\nMoscow has warned Finland that joining NATO would be \"a grave mistake with far-reaching consequences\" and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said it would respond by building military bases in western Russia.\n\nBut both Finland and Sweden are now apparently on the fast track to join the military alliance, with US President Joe Biden this week offering \"full, total, complete backing\" to their bids.\n\nAll 30 existing NATO members must agree on any new entrants, and Turkey has condemned Sweden's alleged toleration of Kurdish militants, but diplomats are confident of avoiding a veto.\n\nOn the ground in Ukraine, the fighting is fiercest in the eastern region of Donbas, a Russian-speaking area that has been partially controlled by pro-Kremlin separatists since 2014.\n\n\"They completely ruined Rubizhne, Vonokvakha, just as they did Mariupol,\" Zelensky said Friday, adding that the Russians were \"trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities\".\n\nIn Severodonetsk, a frontline city now at risk of encirclement, 12 people were killed and another 40 wounded by Russian shelling, the regional governor said.\n\n'End of the operation'\n\nZelensky described the bombardment of Severodonetsk as \"brutal and absolutely pointless\", as residents cowering in basements described an unending ordeal of terror.\n\nThe city forms part of the last pocket of Ukrainian resistance in Lugansk, which along with the neighbouring region of Donetsk comprises the Donbas war zone.\n\nOn Friday, Moscow said the battle for the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol -- a symbol of Ukraine's dogged resistance since Putin launched the invasion on February 24 -- was now over.\n\nRussian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenko said 2,439 Ukrainian personnel had surrendered at the steelworks since May 16, the final 500 on Friday.\n\nUkraine hopes to exchange the surrendering Azovstal soldiers for Russian prisoners. But in Donetsk, pro-Kremlin authorities are threatening to put some of them on trial.\n\nBiden has cast the Ukraine war as part of a US-led struggle pitting democracy against authoritarianism.\n\nThe US Congress this week approved a $40-billion (38-billion-euro) aid package, including funds to enhance Ukraine's armoured vehicle fleet and air defence system.\n\nAnd, meeting in Germany, G7 industrialised nations pledged $19.8 billion to shore up Ukraine's shattered public finances.\n\n- Underground living -\n\nWhile the invasion has ebbed around the northeastern city of Kharkiv, it remains in Russian artillery range, and hundreds of people are refusing to leave the relative safety of its metro system.\n\n\"We're tired.

With fighting underway on the city outskirts, Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai said that \"the Russians are destroying Severodonetsk, like Mariupol.\" Six civilians were killed Friday during Russian bombardments, he said.\n\nThe assault comes as Russia claims full control of the Azovstal steel plant, the sprawling complex that had been the final battleground for control of Mariupol. Russia's Defense Ministry said 2,439 Ukrainian fighters there have surrendered in recent days - a figure that drastically exceeds other estimates. Ukraine has not confirmed Moscow's claims that the entire facility is now in Russian hands.\n\nOutside Ukraine, the war's far-reaching diplomatic and economic impacts continue to be felt. Finland's gas transmission network operator said Saturday that Russia had stopped shipping natural gas to it. The suspension is widely viewed as retaliation after Helsinki formally applied to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nFinnish President Sauli Niinisto said Saturday that he had an \"open and direct phone call\" with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about Finland's NATO application, which Turkey has sought to block.\n\nNiinisto said he told Erdogan that Finland and Turkey would protect each other's security as NATO allies and have a closer relationship. Finland also \"condemns terrorism,\" Niinisto said he told Erdogan.\n\n\"Close dialogue continues,\" the Finnish president wrote.\n\nErdogan has voiced concerns about Finland and Sweden joining NATO, among them that they give safe harbor to terrorists, apparently referring to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has fought a separatist insurgency in parts of Turkey for decades.\n\nThe United States has also designated the PKK a terrorist organization, but has worked with other Kurdish groups fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nAdmitting Finland to NATO requires the approval of all 30 member states, so Turkey could stop the Nordic nation's accession.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n- Russia has prevented the evacuation of children, the sick and the elderly from the southern Kherson region to Ukrainian-held territory, a Ukrainian military spokesman said Saturday.\n\nIn an update posted on Facebook, Oleksandr Shtupun said Russian forces were also stopping the entry of food and medicine to the area.\n\nThe region's capital, also called Kherson, was the first major city to fall to Russian forces after the Feb. 24 invasion. The region's Russian-installed administration later said it intends to ask Moscow to incorporate the Kherson region into the Russian Federation.\n\nThe Ukrainian military spokesman's update also said that Russia began efforts to restore the port, notably by demining infrastructure, after Russian authorities declared Friday that they had taken \"full control\" of Mariupol's embattled steel plant.\n\nThe complex had been the last remaining stronghold of Ukrainian soldiers in the southeastern city, which lies on the Sea of Azov.\n\n- Ukrainian prosecutors have identified another Russian soldier who they allege was responsible for the death of Ukrainian citizens during the siege of the Kyiv region.\n\nA 30-year-old commander of Russia's 64th Motorized Rifle Brigade ordered his soldiers to kill civilians in the village of Lypivka, west of Bucha, Ukraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, posted Friday on Facebook. She named him as Vasyl Lytvynenko and called him \"responsible for violations of the laws and customs of war, as well as murder.\"\n\nThe announcement came a day after the first Russian soldier to be put on trial for war crimes since the invasion, 21-year-old Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, apologized in court to the widow of the 62-year-old civilian he admitted killing. Ukrainian prosecutors investigating the atrocities allegedly committed by Russian forces during the occupation of the Kyiv region say they plan to put captured soldiers on trial for war crimes despite limitations such as the difficulty of finding and collecting evidence amid a war.\n\nVenediktova described how village residents had to get permission from Lytvynenko to take medication and leave their homes for water during the Russian occupation. The prosecutor general also said Lytvynenko ordered his soldiers to wound an unarmed, elderly civilian in his own yard, shoot at the man's home with tank artillery and then set it ablaze.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, Venediktova said, as prosecutors try to determine who else played a role in the crimes, as well as Lytvynenko's alleged involvement in injuring two other people and destroying 18 homes.\n\n- The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations is sounding an alarm about the ongoing global food crisis.\n\n\"I can tell you on a scale of 1 to 10, I'm probably at the 10 level of alarm, because this crisis has exacerbated what is already a serious food insecurity issue,\" Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the BBC World Service on Friday.\n\nThe pandemic and climate change were already having a negative impact on global food supplies, she said, but the Russian invasion and its blockade of Ukrainian ports \"exacerbated this situation and made it even more dire, and the impact is being felt across the world.\"\n\nThomas-Greenfield said the United States plans to maintain pressure on Moscow to end the war. She denied that any discussions have been held on lifting sanctions in return for Russia easing the blockade on food supplies, stressing that no sanctions have targeted food production. She also urged other nations not to restrict food exports.\n\nLast week, India, the world's second-largest wheat producer, banned exports of the grain, citing its own food security needs amid soaring global prices.\n\nThe World Food Program has warned of \"catastrophic\" consequences if Ukrainian ports remain blocked, with many countries in the Middle East and Africa reliant on Ukrainian and Russian grains.\n\n- The Russian military risks weakening its operational effectiveness if it continues to lose reconnaissance drones at the current rate, the British Defense Ministry said in a Saturday intelligence update.\n\nRussian and Ukrainian forces have relied heavily on drones in the war, and attrition of this equipment has been heavy on both sides. For Russia, the devices identify battlefield targets that are then bombed by Russian jets or artillery - a maneuver that was tested in Syria, the ministry said.\n\nBut Russia will likely find it difficult to restock the drones, given the impact of sanctions on its domestic manufacturers, the ministry warned, and a shortage would degrade its ability to gather intelligence and conduct surveillance. Ukraine's intact air-defense missile systems have also managed to deter Russian aircraft from conducting sorties over Ukrainian-held territory, it added.", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "matzav.com"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://matzav.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/biden-1-scaled.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 35, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 46, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049009100", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "23:22:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T23:22:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T23:10:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5137255191802979, "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/ukraine-orders-end-defence-mariupol-2697346", "title": "Ukraine orders end to defence of Mariupol", "body": "KYIV: Ukraine on Friday (May 20) ordered its last troops holed up in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks to lay down their arms, while Russia said its months-long operation to capture the strategic port city is now complete.\n\nRussia's flattening of Mariupol has drawn multiple accusations of war crimes, including over a deadly attack on a maternity ward, and Ukraine has begun a legal reckoning for captured Russian troops.\n\nThe first post-invasion trial of a Russian soldier for war crimes neared its climax in Kyiv, after 21-year-old sergeant Vadim Shishimarin admitted to killing an unarmed civilian early in the offensive.

There is tremendous pressure on the country to distance itself from Russia but the government is standing firm on being independent,\" he said.\n\nPresident of the United States Joe Biden on Saturday signed legislation to support Ukraine with another $40 billion in U.S. assistance as the Russian-Ukraine crisis approaches its fourth month.\n\nThe legislation, which was passed by Congress with bipartisan support, deepens the U.S. commitment to Ukraine at a time of uncertainty about the war's future. Ukraine has successfully defended Kyiv, and Russia has refocused its offensive on the country's east, but American officials warn of the potential for a prolonged conflict.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on Saturday that only a diplomatic breakthrough rather than an outright military victory could end Russia's war on his country, as Moscow cut gas supplies to Finland.\n\n\"There are things that can only be reached at the negotiating table,\" Mr. Zelensky said, just as Russia claimed its long-range missiles had destroyed a shipment of Western arms destined for Ukraine's troops.\n\nWith the Russian invasion of Ukraine nearing three months, Sweden and Finland (SweFin), the two Nordic countries that have historically stayed out of military alliances, have formally applied to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\n\nIf President Vladimir Putin ordered the Ukraine attack on February 24, apparently to prevent NATO's further expansion into Russia's neighbourhood, he is now facing the prospects of two countries joining the trans-Atlantic military alliance.\n\nBut their accession into NATO may not be smooth. Turkey, a NATO member since 1952, has said it would oppose the Nordic countries joining the bloc, citing that they harbour \"terrorist groups\" -- a reference to Kurdish insurgent outfits. Put together, these developments -- the continuing war in Ukraine, fresh NATO applications, and Turkey's opposition to SweFin's bid -- have shaken up Europe's delicate security equilibrium further.\n\nRussian energy giant Gazprom said on May 21 that it had stopped all natural gas supplies to Finland as it had not received payment in rubles.\n\nAfter Russia moved troops into Ukraine on February 24, Moscow has asked clients from \"unfriendly countries\" -- including EU member states -- to pay for gas in rubles, a way to sidestep Western financial sanctions.\n\nThe women's and men's professional tennis tours will not award ranking points for Wimbledon this year because of the All-England Club's ban on players from Russia and Belarus over the invasion of Ukraine, an unprecedented move that stands as a significant rebuke of the sport's oldest Grand Slam tournament.", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/sxwxy2/article65444973.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_615/Ukraine_Russia_Mariupol_22177.jpg-76443.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 26, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 38, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7048079035", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "08:20:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T08:20:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T08:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5058823823928833, "url": "https://www.kyivpost.com/article/opinion/op-ed/heroes-of-steel.html", "title": "Heroes of Steel - KyivPost - Ukraine's Global Voice", "body": "The Azov Regiment was established in Kyiv on May 5, 2014, as a battalion of the special police patrol service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. It has since gone through several stages of reorganization. Today, it exists as a separate special purpose detachment in the military unit of the National Guard of Ukraine. The Azov Regiment has been protecting the territorial integrity of Ukraine since the beginning of the war in 2014. More than 150 Azov servicemen have been awarded State awards, some posthumously.\n\nWhat has been happening at Azovstal?\n\nAzovstal is a huge metallurgical plant in Mariupol, a south-eastern city of Ukraine under siege for 78 days (as of 17 May 2022). The name of the plant refers to the Sea of Azov and the word for \"steel\" in Ukrainian. The plant itself covers more than four square miles and once employed over 10,000 people. During the siege of Mariupol, the Soviet-era bunkers beneath the plant became a shelter for civilians and Ukrainian armed forces.\n\nIn May 2022, civilians were evacuated from the territory of the plant with the help of the United Nations and the International Red Cross and Crescent Committee. It is yet unclear if all civilians have been evacuated or whether some still remain at the plant. The evacuation did not go smoothly. The Russian side has broken promised ceasefires several times. At least two Ukrainian servicemen conducting the evacuation were killed, with more wounded. The Russian side continues heavy shelling on Azovstal and on Mariupol as a whole from sea, land, and air, typically with only 10-12 minutes intervals between attacks.\n\nOn May 16, Russians launched phosphorous bombs at Azovstal, which are prohibited under international humanitarian law. On May 17, 265 Azovstal defenders were reportedly taken into Russian captivity, with 51 heavily wounded. The Ukrainian defense ministry said it was hoping for an \"exchange procedure... to repatriate these Ukrainian heroes as quickly as possible.\" On May 19, Russia said the number of Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered at the besieged Azovstal steel plant had risen to 1,730. The number of those remaining in tunnels and bunkers and stil fighting is unknown.\n\nWhy those in Azovstal must be saved?\n\n\"Second, the Russians are not to be trusted. And last but not least, those servicemen in Azovstal, not only from the Azov Regiment, are witnesses to unimaginable Russian war crimes, including the murder of more than 25,000 civilians. These crimes are potentially of a gravity exceeding those of Bucha, Irpin, and other suffering cities of Ukraine. To surrender means death to these soldiers.\n\nHow to save them\n\nThe example of Azovstal is unprecedented. It may be compared to the Battle of Thermopylae due to Ukrainians bring outnumbered and heroic. But Ukraine wants its \"Heroes of Steel\" alive.\n\nBesides surrender, the only alternative is \"extraction.\" Following the example of Operation Dynamo, part of the 1940 Dunkirk evacuation, the military keeping defense in Azovstal can be extracted by a third State to its territory and maintained there until the end of the armed conflict. The Mariupol garrison has already made respective appeals to Turkey, the U.S., and other States. Some actions in this vein have reportedly already been taken.\n\nIn 2021, the Ukrainian military proved the procedure of extraction to be possible. On August 27 2021, the Ukrainian military conducted extraction during the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Ukrainian civil and military aviation saved a lot of European and U.S. citizens. Before that, two attempts by Canadians and one attempt by the U.S. failed. The extraction by Ukraine was successful since Ukrainian soldiers were the only ones to go out into the city of Kabul on foot and escort people onto the airfield. The Ukrainian military proved that it can stand up for the others and that the procedure of extraction is possible.\n\nThe Azov Battalion continues to fight for European security and world democratic values by standing unmovable as if made of steel. If you have ever wished you could save those from \"The 300 Spartans\" movie, now you have a chance. We should therefore save those \"Heroes of Steel\" using the procedure of extraction.\n\nTetiana Tsurkovska, LL.M.

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the \"Donbass republics\" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.\n\n\"To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.\" [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]\n\nThe eighty-sixth day of the heroic opposition of the Ukrainian nation to the Russian military invasion continues.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy has revealed a weeks-long mystery about the siege of the Azovstal in Mariupol: How were supplies delivered to fighters in the steel mill? Ukrainian pilots risked Russian anti-aircraft fire to fly medicine, food and water to the steel mill on helicopters, suffering a large amount of casualties, Zelenskyy said in an interview on the third anniversary of his inauguration as president. He said the effort also included retrieval of bodies and picking up the wounded. \"They are absolutely heroic people, who knew that it would be difficult, knew that to fly would be almost impossible,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nDespite recent calls between the Pentagon chief and the top US military general with their Russian counterparts, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other senior US diplomats are not ready to follow suit with Russian diplomats. State Department Spokesman Ned Price said there were no indications that such a call between US and Russian diplomats would help decrease the violence in Ukraine. For the latest headlines, follow our Google News channel online or via the app. \"It is in our assessment, not the time at the moment for a high-level call... precisely because we have seen no indication that the Russians are serious about engaging in a constructive dialogue,\" Price told Al Arabiya English during a call with reporters.\n\nRussia's success in the special operation in Ukraine will mean for Washington \"the collapse of the hegemony of the collective West,\" so the United States is interested in continuing the \"war to the last Ukrainian.\" This opinion was expressed on Friday by the head of the LDPR faction, chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, Leonid Slutsky. \"For Washington, the success of Russia's special operation will mean the collapse of the hegemony of the collective West and its neo-colonial policy. Namely, the United States cannot allow this. Therefore, the United States is vitally interested in continuing the\" war to the last Ukrainian \". than collateral damage,\" Slutsky wrote on the Telegram channel.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence reported that as many as 1,700 Ukrainian soldiers are likely to have surrendered from the Mariupol Azovstal steel factory. An unknown number of Ukrainian forces remain inside the factory. Once Russia has secured Mariupol, it is likely they will move their forces to reinforce operations in the Donbas. Staunch Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol since the start of the war means Russian forces in the area must be re-equipped and refurbished before they can be redeployed effectively. This can be a lengthy process when done thoroughly. Russian commanders, however, are under pressure to demonstrably achieve operational objectives. This means that Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition.\n\nThere was more criticism of the Russian offensive strategy on Russian social media. \"The war of attrition in Donbas is continuing, and the strategic impasse for the Russian army (while the Ukrainian army is buying time) is becoming more pronounced,\" Igor Strelkov (Girkin), a former FSB officer who orchestrated much of pro-Russian unrest in Donbas in 2014, wrote on his Telegram channel.\n\nThe Russians do not stop conducting offensive operations in the Eastern Operational Zone and shelling the area along the line of contact and in the depths of the defense of Ukrainian troops in the Donetsk operational area and in the Slavic direction. The Russians are launching missile strikes on infrastructure facilities and residential neighborhoods in Ukraine. Artillery shelling of Ukrainian cities continues, resulting in numerous civilian casualties.\n\nIn the Volyn and Polissya directions, units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus (up to seven battalions) perform tasks on a rotating basis to cover the section of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border. According to available information, Two missile divisions of the Tochka-U tactical missile complex and the Tornado multiple rocket launcher division have been deployed at separate ranges in the territory of the Republic of Belarus.\n\nIn the period from June 22 to July 1 this year in the Gomel region is scheduled to hold a meeting with conscripts. The threat of rocket bombings and artillery shelling from the territory of the Republic of Belarus has not disappeared.\n\nIn the Seversky direction, in order to clarify the position of Ukrainian units, the Russians conducted air reconnaissance with the use of UAVs, and continued the engineering equipment of positions on the territory of the Russian Federation along the state border of Ukraine. In the Slobozhansky direction, the Russians fired artillery at the positions of Ukrainian troops north of the city of Kharkiv, and inflicted air strikes and conducted remote mining on the routes of possible deployment of units of the Defense Forces. In the Slavic direction of the Russians grouping, the main efforts are focused on conducting offensive operations, regrouping troops, as well as the accumulation of material and technical resources.\n\nThe Russians fired artillery at the positions of Ukrainian troops to the south and southwest of the city of Izyum. In order to clarify the position of Ukrainian troops, he conducted air reconnaissance with two Orlan-10 UAVs. According to available information, in the area of the settlement of Yaremivka the Russians tried to bring a pontoon crossing over the river Seversky Donets.\n\nIn the temporarily occupied territories of Kharkiv region, the Russians continued to block the work of Ukrainian mobile operators, distributes propaganda materials, tried to establish broadcasting on Russian TV and radio channels. In the Donetsk direction, the Russians were trying to conduct active hostilities in the Lyman, Severodonetsk and Bakhmut directions. In the Lyman and Severodonetsk directions, the Russians fired on the positions of Ukrainian units in the areas of the settlements of Lyman, Siversk, Lysychansk, and Severodonetsk.\n\nIn the Bakhmut direction, with the support of artillery, Russians conducted an offensive, trying to seize new frontiers in the area of the settlement of Popasna, but Ukraine claimed that they had no success. OSINT Aggregator reported \"There is a growing risk that Russian forces around Popasna may be gaining momentum against Ukrainian defenders in the area. Today Russia captured Nova Kamyanka, Stryapivka, Volodymyrivka, Trypillya & Druzhba to the W and Troitske to the S of the city.\" Ukraine War Map reports the Russian \"attacking in multiple directions out from Popasna and has reportedly captured Vrubivka and Druzhba\".\n\nIn the Kurakhiv direction, with the support of artillery and assault aircraft, the Russians launched an offensive in the direction of the settlement of Novomykhailivka (10 km south of Marinka), and had no success.\n\nIn Mariupol, the Russians were filtering the local population. Russia's defence ministry said the last group of Ukrainian forces holed up in Mariupol's Azovstal steel works has surrendered. On Novopavlovsky, Kryvyi Rih, In the Kherson and Zaporizhzhya directions, the Russians continues to shell units of Ukrainian troops. In the South Buz and Tavriya directions, the grouping of the occupying forces focuses on the maintenance of the occupied frontiers, conducting reconnaissance, engineering equipment of positions and logistical support of units. The Russians continued engineering work on the equipment of the second line of defense. In order to prevent the advance of Ukrainian units, the bridge over the Ingulets River in the area of Davydovo Brod was mined.\n\nAs part of the recruitment of units that suffered casualties, in the area of the village of Chornobaivka, the Russians moved about 130 units of military equipment. In the Tavriya direction, the Russians took measures to provide logistics to the troops. In the Bessarabian direction, Russian special services were taking measures to destabilize the situation in the region. Information about mining of social infrastructure facilities and so-called \"state\" institutions in the cities of Tiraspol, Bender, Dubossary and Rybnytsia was again disseminated.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense reported that the aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces destroyed more than 280 nationalists, disabled 59 units of military equipment per day. According to the agency, the Russian Aerospace Forces with high-precision missiles destroyed the launcher of the Osa-AKM air defense system and the illumination and guidance radar of the Ukrainian S-300 air defense system. Russian air defense systems shot down 10 UAVs and intercepted 17 Smerch MLRS shells of Ukraine in a day, the Russian Defense Ministry said.\n\nThe Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) use Su-57 fighter jets during the military operation in Ukraine, a source in the military-industrial complex told TASS.\n\nGerman news agency DPA reported that the country will ship the first 15 Gepard anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine in July. DPA reported that the delivery, which includes training and almost 60,000 rounds of ammunition, was agreed following talks between Germany's defence minister and her Ukrainian counterpart. Gepard -- German for \"cheetah\" -- is considered highly effective against low-flying aircraft and lightly armoured ground targets. It was decommissioned by the German military in 2012 but some 50 mothballed units are being restored by manufacturer KMW for use by Ukraine.\n\nThe Group of Seven (G7) leading economies agreed Friday to provide $19.8bn in economic aid to Ukraine to ensure its finances do not hinder its ability to defend itself from Russia's invasion. German finance minister Christian Lindner told reporters that $9.5bn of the total amount was mobilized at meetings of the G7 finance ministers in Koenigswinter, Germany, this week.\n\nGermany struck a deal to receive liquefied natural gas imports from Qatar as part of a shift away from Russian energy. The German government said that the agreement was signed during a visit by Qatar's Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani. The European nation wants to reduce its dependence on Russian energy in light of the invasion of Ukraine. Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told German media that his country could deliver LNG as early as 2024. About 55 percent of Germany's natural gas imports came from Russia before the invasion. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a news conference that the deal with Qatar secured enough LNG for his country.\n\nGermany's Former Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der stepped down from the board of the Russian state-owned oil company, a week after the Bundestag announced he would lose his taxpayer-funded office and staff. Schr\u00f6der was a Social Democratic party (SPD) chancellor from 1998 to 2005. After leaving office, he went on to work for Russian energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft, among others.\n\nThe Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees reported that from February 24 to May 19, the number of people who left Ukraine reached 6,404,679; over the past day, 43,563 refugees crossed the borders of neighboring states.

Shoigu, had informed President Vladimir V. Putin of the \"complete liberation\" of the Mariupol steel plant where Ukrainian fighters had made their last stand in the city before surrendering in recent days. Ukrainian officials have not confirmed the Russian claim.\n\nThe Ukrainian military, for its part, said that in the past day it had repulsed 11 attacks in the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, collectively known as the Donbas region, and had destroyed eight tanks as well as other Russian combat vehicles.\n\nOverall, Mr. Zelensky asserted, Ukraine has \"broken the backbone of the largest, or one of the strongest, armies in the world.\"\n\nThe war is now set to enter its fourth month, and while Moscow has been forced to retreat first from outside the capital, Kyiv, and more recently from the country's second-largest city, Kharkiv, neither side is currently making more than incremental gains.\n\nWith the conflict coming ever closer to a stalemate and both sides fighting in the Donbas region to gain the upper hand, calls for a cease-fire have grown louder, along with questions about what would constitute victory, or at least a suitable outcome, for Ukraine.\n\n\"A cease-fire must be achieved as soon as possible,\" the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, urged on Thursday, opening a parliamentary debate on Italy's role in backing Ukraine. He added that \"we have to bring Moscow to the negotiating table.\"\n\nGerman, French and Italian suggestions of a cease-fire have been rejected angrily and even bitterly by Kyiv as selfish and poorly timed. Ukrainian officials say that Russia is hardly ready for serious peace talks and that their forces -- despite considerable losses in the Donbas and in Mariupol -- have the momentum in the war.\n\nFor now, some in Ukraine are insisting that the only outcome it will abide is the restoration of all territory lost to Russia since 1991, when it gained independence from the Soviet Union. That would include both the Donbas in its entirety and Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. But Mr. Zelensky has hinted that he would accept the status quo ante before the war.\n\nWestern diplomats maintain that this is a matter for Ukraine to decide. But their unanimity begins to break down when it turns to specifics.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, Julianne Smith, speaking at a conference in Warsaw, restated the United States' firm support of Ukraine. \"In terms of the end state,\" she added, \"we believe we will see Ukraine prevail, and we want them to protect their territorial integrity and their sovereignty.\"\n\nBut she added another objective: \"We want to see a strategic defeat of Russia. We want to see Russia leave Ukraine.\"\n\nFor Eastern European and Baltic leaders, a durable peace settlement and an end to the conflict has to include a crushing military victory that spells an end to Mr. Putin's presidency. Anything short of his departure would merely pave the way for the next war, they say. They balk at suggestions from Berlin, Paris and Rome to lure Mr. Putin back to the negotiating table.\n\n\"Peace can't be the ultimate goal,\" Prime Minister Kaja Kallas of Estonia recently told The New York Times. \"I only see a solution as a military victory that could end this once and for all, and also punishing the aggressor for what he has done.\"\n\nOtherwise, she said, \"we go back to where we started -- you will have a pause of one year, two years, and then everything will continue.\"\n\n\"All these events should wake us from our geopolitical slumber, and cause us to cast off our delusions,\" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland said on Thursday at the Warsaw conference. \"I hear there are attempts to allow Putin to somehow save face in the international arena. But how can you save something that has been utterly disfigured?\"\n\n\"Russia can only be deterred by our unity, military capabilities and hard sanctions,\" he added. \"Not by phone calls and conversations with Putin.\"\n\nIn a diplomatic salvo of its own, Russia's Foreign Ministry on Saturday released a list of 963 people who would be barred for life from entering Russia, among them Mr. Biden, the actor Morgan Freeman and the New York Times columnist Bret Stephens. The ministry described its move as \"necessary\" retaliation against the \"hostile actions\" of the United States.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of an unfolding debate about what a final settlement might look like, Russian and Ukrainian forces dug in on the battlefield, conscious that every military victory would turn into a diplomatic advantage.\n\nRussia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4\n\nSupport for Ukraine. President Biden signed a new $40 billion aid package for Ukraine, bringing the total American investment in the war to $54 billion in just over two months, a day after the Group of 7 economic powers pledged they would provide nearly $20 billion to support Ukraine's economy over the coming months.\n\nRussia's punishment of Finland. Russia cut off its natural gas supplies to Finland on May 21, according to Finland's state energy provider. Russia said that it was suspending the supply because Finland had failed to comply with its demand to make payments in rubles. Finland has also submitted an application to join NATO, angering Russia.\n\nIn southeast Ukraine. Fresh from its triumph over the last armed Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol, Russia appeared to be laying the groundwork for annexing swaths of southeastern Ukraine. Russian officials have already moved to introduce the ruble as the local currency, install proxy politicians in government and cut the population off from Ukrainian broadcasts.\n\nNATO's expansion. Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said he was determined to \"say no to Finland and Sweden's NATO membership,\" though he was willing to continue talking to European leaders. He has pointed to the two nations' stance toward Kurdish militant groups he regards as terrorist organizations as a reason for his objections.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said on Saturday that Russia was demining the port of Mariupol in an attempt to get it running again. Reopening the port would tighten Moscow's control over the parts of southern and eastern Ukraine that it controls, as well as increase its economic leverage over the Black Sea, where its navy is dominant.\n\nAnd Russian forces have become entrenched in areas outside of the city of Kharkiv, presenting a formidable obstacle to any Ukrainian efforts to press their advantage in that area.\n\nRussia's military prepared on Saturday to attempt another pontoon crossing of an eastern Ukrainian river that has posed a formidable barrier to its aims in the region, Ukraine's military said, despite suffering one of its single most lethal engagements of the war in a previous attempt this month.\n\nRussian forces were staging bridging equipment again near the Seversky Donets River, the Ukrainian military said in its regularly published morning assessment of the war. The stream's winding path cuts through the heart of the region where Russian forces are battling Ukrainian defenders -- around the cities of Izium, Sloviansk, Kramatorsk and Sievierodonetsk -- creating major obstacles to Moscow's offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"The enemy has not ceased offensive actions in the eastern operation zone with the goal of establishing full control over the territory of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions,\" the assessment said.\n\nUkraine's military has blown up bridges to force the Russians to build pontoon bridges, a tactic that has proved effective -- and costly for the Russian army. Military forces are particularly vulnerable to artillery strikes as they congregate soldiers, armored vehicles and equipment while attempting a crossing.\n\nIn the battle for control of the Donbas region, Russian forces have attempted several pontoon crossings of the Seversky Donets, seen as an important tactical step toward the goal of surrounding a pocket of Ukrainian troops in and around the city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nOn May 11, Ukrainian artillery struck a pontoon crossing with devastating effect, destroying the bridge, incinerating armored vehicles on both river banks and killing more than 400 soldiers, according to estimates by Western military analysts. The British Defense Ministry has issued statements corroborating the Ukrainian accounts, based on satellite imagery and aerial drone imagery posted online of the strike.\n\nWhatever the ultimate outcome of the war, no one expects it to end soon, as each country's leader needs to be able to claim some sort of victory, particularly Mr. Zelensky.\n\n\"For Zelensky, there is no other path forward than to continue to fight and reconquer the territory they lost,\" said Andrew A. Michta, a German-based foreign policy and defense analyst. \"The minute he agrees to any compromise, given the blood paid, he loses political credibility. The Ukrainians can't cut a deal just to stop the fighting, so this will be a long, drawn-out war.\"\n\nSteven Erlanger reported from Brussels, Andrew E.

In the midst of a continuing assault, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has sought compensation from Moscow for all the damage. Kyiv has estimated its war losses at around $100 billion, according to reports.\n\nHere are ten latest updates on the Ukraine war:\n\n1. \"We invite partner countries to sign a multilateral agreement and create a mechanism ensuring that everybody who suffered from (the) Russian actions can receive compensation for all losses incurred,\" the Ukrainian president said in his nightly address.\n\n2. \"That would be fair.

The Russians besieged the plant for weeks. Hundreds of civilians and military personnel were trapped, completely isolated, without food or medical aid. On May 7 it was announced that all women, children and the elderly had been evacuated from the factory.\n\nOn Monday, the evacuation of Ukrainian soldiers who were holed up in the factory began. \"The Mariupol garrison has completed its combat mission,\" said the commander of the Ukrainian army.

Gazum had previously been at loggerheads with Gazprom over how to pay the gas bill. The Russian state-owned company wants to see rubles for it, something Gazum rejects.\n\nThe Finnish company claims that gas supplies can be paid in euros in accordance with the contract. In this regard, Gazum decided to go to the judge to step. Earlier, the supply of Russian gas to Poland and Bulgaria stopped because these two countries refused to pay in rubles.\n\nIn the background, Finland's rapprochement with NATO may play a role.

Sweden has a powerful air force and significant naval capabilities.\" So both countries would \"bring a lot to the table,\" Rasmussen said. \"They will increase NATO's defense capability -- especially with the Baltic in mind.\"\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has called upon former Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der to cease all support for Russian companies.\n\nIt comes after Schr\u00f6der stood down from his role on the board of Russian energy company Rosneft under immense pressure in Germany.\n\nSchr\u00f6der is currently nominated for a supervisory role on the board of Russian energy company Gazprom, and is a lobbyist for its subsidiaries Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2.\n\nSchr\u00f6der was ambiguous about his future at Gazprom in an interview with the New York Times -- his only interview since Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nThe Gazprom annual general meeting is scheduled for June 30.\n\n\"We take note that it is now happening at one company, the others must still follow,\" Scholz said on Saturday on the sidelines of an SPD party conference in Germany.\n\nOn Friday, Schr\u00f6der announced \"the impossibility of extending his powers on the board of directors of the company.\"\n\nThe 78-year-old led Germany from 1998 to 2005, but has become increasingly isolated in recent months over his lobbyist work for Russian energy companies.\n\nEarlier, SPD Secretary-General Kevin K\u00fchnert criticized Schr\u00f6der's resignation as coming too late.\n\nScholz has rejected demands for sanctions on Schr\u00f6der, saying the government's plans to remove his taxpayer-funded privileges -- except his pension and his security staff -- sufficed.\n\nGlobal risk analyst Justin Crump told DW that securing Mariupol would free Russia up for other military activity elsewhere, after having committed many troops to the lengthy siege of the vast underground steelworks.\n\n\"I'm sure most viewers have seen just quite how large the site was. And you think covering thousands of meters of frontage was tying up a lot of soldiers that can now be used,\" said Crump, CEO of global risk analysis consultancy Sibylline.\n\nHe said Russian soldiers were now needed on the country's southern front and in the Donbas, as well as holding onto Mariupol itself and restoring order and facilities in a city which he described as a \"shelled ruin\" at this point.\n\nCrump described the fight in Ukraine as \"evenly matched\" currently, yet acknowledged that Russia's gains are on frontlines that had been \"static for years.\"\n\nThe analyst also said reactions to the Mariupol capture were \"split\" inside Ukraine, between those who wanted the holdout to continue for longer, and others who just celebrated how long it lasted.\n\nFinnish President Sauli Niinisto said his country condemns \"terrorism in all its forms\" in a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan Saturday, as Sweden and Finland work on easing Erdogan's rejection of them formally joining the NATO alliance.\n\n\"I stated that as NATO allies Finland and Turkey will commit to each other's security and our relationship will thus grow stronger,\" Niinisto wrote on Twitter, saying that \"close dialogue continues.\"\n\nErdogan told Niinisto that \"overlooking threatening terrorist organizations\" is not in line with the NATO alliance's ethos, according to the Turkish presidency.\n\nHe reiterated the same line in a separate phone call with Sweden's Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson, expecting Sweden to take \"concrete\" steps toward his country's concern regarding terrorist groups.\n\nHe also called on Sweden to lift the 2019 arms embargo it imposed in response to Ankara's military operations in Syria against Kurdish groups.\n\nThe Turkish president is trying to halt Sweden and Finland's bids to join NATO, over what he described as their countries' harboring of \"terrorists.\"\n\nErdogan is referring to Kurdish groups such as the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Syrian People's Defense Units (YPG) which Turkey has branded as \"terrorists.\" The EU and US also classify the PKK as a terrorist organization. Turkey has fought a Kurdish insurgency, primarily in its southeast, for decades, displacing around 3 million people in total.\n\nThe daily situation report from Ukraine's military general staff said that 11 Russian attacks were repelled in the eastern region on Saturday. It also warned of the danger of air strikes from neighboring Belarus, which is not officially a combatant but which has let Russia station troops on its territory.\n\nUkraine accused Russian troops of preventing fleeing civilians from attempting to exit the Kherson area, also accusing them of blocking new humanitarian corridors.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry meanwhile said on Saturday that its long-range missiles had destroyed a shipment of western weapons bound for Ukraine's troops.\n\nRussia has issued a complete list of 963 Americans, including US President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and CIA chief William Burns, who are banned from entering the country.\n\nThe bans are an indication of the deterioration in ties between Moscow and Washington since Russian President Vladimir Putin began his invasion of Ukraine on February 24.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has signed a bill providing Ukraine with $40 billion (\u20ac38 billion) in aid to help fund its war effort amid the Russian invasion.\n\nHalf of that money goes toward the Ukrainian military.\n\nBiden signed the bill after it was flown to him during a trip to Asia.\n\nThe bill, which includes funds to upgrade Ukraine's armored vehicle fleet and air defense system, was approved by the US Congress this week with bipartisan support\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that diplomacy was the only way to end Russia's invasion of his country.\n\n\"The end will be through diplomacy,\" he told a Ukrainian television channel. The war \"will be bloody, there will be fighting but will only definitively end through diplomacy.\"\n\nNegotiations between Kyiv and Moscow are at a standstill, with both countries accusing each other of intransigence.\n\nA major issue hampering the talks is whether Russia should end up retaining territories it has seized in the war, or pull back to its internationally recognized borders.\n\nRepresentatives of the US, Canada, New Zealand, Japan and Australia walked out of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in the Thai capital, Bangkok, in protest at Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe report said the walkout occurred while the Russian representative was speaking at the opening of the two-day meeting.\n\nAlthough many Western nations have expressed outrage at Russia's illegitimate and brutal invasion of its neighbor and imposed tough sanctions on Moscow, several APEC member nations, especially in Southeast Asia and Latin America, have declined to take part in such moves.\n\nUK wants to give Moldova arms to protect against Russia\n\nBritain would like to see Moldova receive modern weaponry to NATO standards to protect it from a Russia that, under President Vladimir Putin, is seeking to enlarge its territory, the British daily The Telegraph has reported.\n\nThe paper cited the UK's foreign minister, Liz Truss, as saying that she wanted \"to see Moldova equipped to NATO standard. This is a discussion we're having with our allies.\"\n\nMoldova, which borders Ukraine to the southwest, is not currently a member of the NATO alliance. Many observers consider it to be a possible target for Putin's territorial ambitions.\n\n\"Putin has been absolutely clear about his ambitions to create a greater Russia. And just because his attempts to take Kyiv weren't successful doesn't mean he's abandoned those ambitions,\" she said.\n\nMoldova applied for EU membership in early March in a move prompted by the invasion in neighboring Ukraine.\n\nThe UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, says more than 6.4 million people have left Ukraine since Russia began its invasion on February 24.\n\nMost have gone to neighboring Poland, which has taken in 3.4 million people from Ukraine, the UNHCR told the German daily Welt am Sonntag. Romania, Russia and Hungary were the other main destinations for refugees from Ukraine, the agency said.\n\nGermany, the Czech Republic and Italy were the non-neighboring countries that had taken in the most Ukrainian refugees, it said.\n\nGermany's Interior Ministry says that more than 700,000 refugees from Ukraine have already been registered, though the real number is thought to be higher.\n\nRussia's supply of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) used for seeking out targets to strike could become increasingly limited as Western sanctions bite, according to an intelligence update from the UK's Ministry of Defence.\n\nThe use of UAVs has been \"pivotal\" for both sides in the war, the update says, but they are vulnerable to being shot down or disabled by electronic jamming, meaning that many have been lost.\n\nAccording to the update, crewed Russian aircraft have been avoiding flying over Ukrainian territory because of the danger posed by Ukrainian air defense systems.\n\nRussian energy giant Gazprom has ceased exporting gas to neighboring Finland, the gas system operator Gasgrid Finland said on Saturday.\n\n\"Gas imports through Imatra entry point have been stopped,\" it said in a statement.\n\nImatra is the entry point for Russian gas into Finland.\n\nThe move comes after Gazprom Export, which later confirmed the stoppage, demanded that European countries pay for Russian gas supplies in rubles because of sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Finland has refused to comply.\n\nThe halt in gas exports from Russia also comes amid tensions with Moscow produced by Finland's application on Wednesday to join NATO.\n\nAlthough most of the gas used in Finland comes from Russia, gas makes up only some 5% of its annual energy consumption.\n\nMoscow already cut off gas to Bulgaria and Poland last month after they refused to pay in rubles.\n\nThe US Defense Department is organizing a video conference for the Ukraine contact group with some 40 countries expected to attend the event hosted by US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, according to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby.\n\nIn late April, Austin hosted international partners at the Ramstein US air base in Germany to discuss how to provide defense aid to Ukraine. He proposed the monthly contact group at the time.\n\nKirby added that several countries not present back in April have since asked to join the Ukraine contact group.\n\nDuring his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late Friday that Ukraine and its allies have formally proposed a deal to obtain financial compensation from Russia for the damage caused by Russian forces and munitions.\n\nZelenskyy added Russia has dedicated itself to destroying as much of Ukrainian infrastructure as possible and that a deal addressing compensation would make it clear to nations planning unwarranted acts of military aggression that they would be made to pay.\n\n\"Russia will feel the weight of every missile, every bomb, every shell which it has fired at us,\" he said.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said it fully controls the territory of the Azovstal steel plant in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol. According to the ministry, the last group of 531 Ukrainian fighters has now surrendered.\n\nSince May 16, a total of 2,439 Ukrainian soldiers have laid down their arms, Russia said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an interview with Ukrainian TV channels that the operation to ensure the withdrawal of Mariupol defenders from the Azovstal steel plant was carried out with the participation of Western partners. Zelenskyy also said that Ukraine lost many helicopter pilots supplying the Mariupol garrison.\n\nHe lashed out against Russian airstrikes that destroyed a recently renovated cultural center in Lozova, in the eastern Kharkiv region. Seven people, including a child, were injured.\n\nOn Telegram, Zelenskyy wrote, \"The occupiers have identified culture, education and humanity as their enemies.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin called for \"technological sovereignty,\" saying Russia has been hit by numerous cyberattacks since Moscow sent troops to Ukraine. According to Putin, the attacks are coming from different countries but are \"clearly coordinated.\"\n\nMoscow is nearing full control of the separatist region of Lugansk in eastern Ukraine, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies. Shoigu's announcement came after Russia's war on Ukraine shifted focus from Kyiv to eastern Ukraine due to losses and strategic defeats.\n\nRussia's lower house of parliament is to debate allowing Russians over 40 and foreigners over 30 to sign up for the military, the State Duma website said on Friday. Up until now, only Russians aged 18-40 and foreigners aged 18-30 have been able to enter into a first contract with the military.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defense said in an intelligence update that Russia is likely to move troops from Mariupol to support its military operations in Donbas after securing the Black Sea port despite stiff resistance by Ukrainian fighters.\n\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is expanding its investigation into human rights violations committed during Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. Observers have been sent to Ukraine to interview witnesses and survivors, the OSCE Office for Democracy and Human Rights (ODIHR) said in a statement.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said Friday that Italy had submitted a peace plan for Ukraine to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. According to Di Maio, the plan calls for local cease-fires to evacuate civilians along humanitarian corridors and create the conditions for a general cease-fire leading \"to a long-lasting peace.\"\n\nThe EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said he was aware of the plan, adding the EU is \"putting all our efforts into trying to bring this conflict to an end.\" Borrell also reiterated warnings of global food shortages due to the war in Ukraine.\n\nGermany will deliver the first 15 \"Gepard\" tanks to Ukraine in July, a German Defense Ministry spokesperson said following a conversation between German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht and her Ukrainian counterpart Oleksii Reznikov. The package also includes training support from the Bundeswehr, the provision of almost 60,000 rounds of ammunition and the delivery of a further 15 tanks in the summer.\n\nFormer German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der has told Russia's state-owned oil company Rosneft that he cannot continue serving on its board of directors, a statement on the company's website says. Former Dresden Stasi chief turned German businessman Matthias Warnig also ditched the Rosneft board.\n\nRussian gas will stop flowing to neighboring Finland on Saturday morning, Finnish state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum has said in a statement.

The troops were evacuated into Russian-controlled territory as part of what Kyiv describes as an ongoing \"rescue operation.\" However, officials in Russia and the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) have cast doubt on the possibility of swapping these soldiers in a prisoner exchange, calling instead for Azov troops to face a \"tribunal\" and even capital punishment.\n\nEarly reports about the evacuation of Ukrainian troops from the Azovstal steel plant said that some 50 wounded were taken to a hospital in Novoazovsk, while the remainder were taken to Olenivka (both of these towns are under the control of the self-proclaimed DNR). On Wednesday, May 18, the Russian Defense Ministry released videos said to be from the hospital in Novoazovsk, which showed men lying in beds; some of them said that they were being given medical treatment and food, and that they were being treated \"normally.\"\n\nOn Thursday, May 19, the Russian Defense Ministry posted another video, with the caption \"Captured fighters from the nationalist 'Azov' unit talk about conditions of detention.\" The video showed a room full of men, standing among dense rows of bunk beds; some of them spoke directly into the camera, describing the conditions of detention as good and saying that they're being treated properly. Where the video was filmed remains unconfirmed, although the Russian state news agency TASS claimed it was recorded in Olenivka. That said, it's mentioned in the video that there are wounded soldiers at this detention facility.\n\nAccording to media reports, the Ukrainian soldiers evacuated from Azovstal are being held at a former penal colony in Olenivka. Earlier, on May 15, Ukrainian officials said that more than 3,000 Mariupol residents had been sent to this \"filtration prison,\" rendering it overcrowded.\n\nOn May 17-18, however, Russian media published unofficial reports that Azov soldiers had been transferred to remand prisons in the Rostov region. RT correspondent Valentin Gorshenin claimed that they had been sent to Rostov-on-Don's Detention Facility No. 1., and the outlet 161.ru cited an unnamed source in law enforcement who said that 89 Azov soldiers had been sent to Taganrog and would be \"distributed further\" from there.\n\nAt this writing, there has been no official confirmation from the Russian side that Azov soldiers and other Ukrainian troops are being held in remand prisons. However, there have been numerous earlier reports of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians captured by Russian troops being sent to detention facilities in Russia's border regions.\n\nAccording to the Russian Defense Ministry, 1,730 Ukrainian soldiers from Azovstal have surrendered since May 16.\n\nOn May 16, Ukrainian officials said that troops evacuated from the Azovstal stronghold would be swapped in a prisoner exchange. However, the next day, Russian lawmakers raised the issue of barring soldiers from the Azov Battalion from prisoner exchanges altogether. State Duma deputy Anatoly Vasserman suggested \"adopting a resolution or even a law prohibiting the exchange of any Nazi criminals.\" He was supported by parliamentary speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, who said that \"Nazi criminals shouldn't be exchanged\" and that these \"war criminals\" should be put on trial.\n\nThe lawmakers also scheduled the consideration of a draft resolution that prohibit the exchange of \"Nazi criminals\" for May 18, but this never actually occured (the potential legal force of this document also remains unclear).\n\nThat same day, lawmaker Leonid Slutsky -- who is a member of the Russian delegation in the stalled peace talks with Ukraine -- suggested \"making an exception to the moratorium on the death penalty in Russia\" for Azov fighters. In a similar vein, Russian senator Andrey Klishas called for putting the \"neo-Nazis from Azov\" on trial in the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk \"People's Republics\" -- where there is no moratorium on capital punishment. In turn, DNR leader Denis Pushilin said that the fate of \"war criminals\" and \"nationalists\" should be decided by a court or an \"international tribunal.\"\n\nThe Russian Attorney General's Office has also asked the Supreme Court to recognize \"Azov\" as a terrorist organization and outlaw its activities in Russia.\n\nWhereas Russian officials maintain that the Ukrainian troops from the Azovstal plant \"surrendered as prisoners,\" Ukrainian officials continue to refer to their evacuation as a \"rescue mission.\" At the same time, Ukrainian authorities have been very cautious about making statements since the moment Azov soldiers began leaving the site.\n\nBased on the statements made so far, it's clear that Kyiv expects these soldiers to be released as the result of a prisoner exchange. According to Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar, Ukraine \"will conduct an operation to return\" the Azov fighters to territory controlled by Kyiv. \"The current plan is the only way to save Azovstal defenders. It was the only option,\" she told journalists on May 17. Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the operation \"requires delicacy and time,\" adding that \"Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive.\"\n\nOn May 18, Deputy Defense Minister Malyar urged Ukrainians to disregard Russian claims about Azovstal's defenders as \"political statements made for their propaganda effect and to achieve the propaganda goal for domestic Russian consumption.\"\n\n\"I understand that everyone wants to know at least some information, but the rescue operation is still underway.

New countries will attend the second, which will be strictly virtual, Kirby said.\n\n\"There are some countries that have shown an interest in participating that weren't in the first meeting,\" said Kirby, who called the first iteration \"a true global community\" of countries in NATO and beyond.\n\nMay 20, 3:41 pm\n\nRussian Ministry of Defense claims it has taken complete control over Azovstal steel plant, Mariupol\n\nRussia's Ministry of Defense claimed Friday it has taken complete control of the Azovstal plant and Mariupol from the Ukrainian forces, expelling them from the port city.\n\nThe underground facilities of the plant, in which the Azov National Regiment militia were hiding, came under the complete control of Russian forces, the ministry claimed.\n\nThe commander of the Azov Regiment was reportedly taken out of the territory of the plant in an armored car, the ministry said.\n\nRussia claims 2,439 Ukrainian servicemen have laid down their arms and surrendered since May 16.\n\nMay 20, 1:10 pm\n\nRussia to cut off Finland's natural gas Saturday morning\n\nGasum, Finland's natural gas company, announced Friday that it was informed its imports from Russia's Gazprom Export will be cut off on Saturday at 7 a.m. local time.\n\nThe move by Russia comes days after Finland submitted its application to join NATO.\n\n\"It is highly regrettable that natural gas supplies under our supply contract will now be halted. However, we have been carefully preparing for this situation and provided that there will be no disruptions in the gas transmission network, we will be able to supply all our customers with gas in the coming months,\" Gasum CEO Mika Wiljanen said in a statement.\n\nGasum will supply natural gas to its customers from other sources though the Balticconnector pipeline, which connects Finland with Estonia, the company said in a statement.\n\nGasum said its gas-filling stations in the network area will continue in normal operation.\n\nMay 20, 8:57 am\n\nUS-supplied howitzers to Ukraine lack accuracy-aiding computers\n\nDozens of artillery systems supplied by the United States to Ukraine were not fitted with advanced computer systems, which improve the efficiency and accuracy of the weapons, ABC News has learned.\n\nThe M777 155mm howitzers are now being used by the Ukrainian military in its war with Russia.\n\nThe Pentagon did not deny that the artillery pieces were supplied without the computers but said it had received \"positive feedback\" from the Ukrainians about the \"precise and highly effective\" weapons.\n\nThat positive sentiment was echoed by a Ukrainian politician, who spoke to ABC News on condition of anonymity. However, the politician also expressed frustration that the artillery pieces had not been the fitted with the digital computer systems.\n\nArtillery is currently playing a crucial role in the fighting across eastern Ukraine, as Russia continues its offensive in that part of the country. U.S. officials recently confirmed that all but one of the 90 howitzers promised to Ukraine had now been delivered, along with tactical vehicles used to tow them.\n\nIf fitted to a howitzer, the digital computer system enables the crew operating the weapon to quickly and accurately pinpoint a target. Howitzers without a computer system can still be fired accurately, using traditional methods to calculate the angle needed to hit a target.\n\nModern computer systems, however, rule out the possibility of human error. Why the artillery pieces supplied to Ukraine did not have the digital targeting technology installed is unclear. The Pentagon said it would not discuss individual components \"for operational security reasons.\"\n\n-ABC News' Tom Burridge and Luis Martinez\n\nMay 20, 6:58 am\n\n1,700 Ukrainian soldiers likely surrendered from Mariupol plant, UK says\n\nAs many as 1,700 Ukrainian soldiers have likely surrendered from the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works plant in war-ravaged Mariupol this week, according to the U.K. Ministry of Defense.\n\n\"An unknown number of Ukrainian forces remain inside the factory,\" the ministry said Friday in an intelligence update. \"Once Russia has secured Mariupol, it is likely they will move their forces to reinforce operations in the Donbas.\"\n\nFor weeks, Ukrainian fighters and civilians were holed up inside the sprawling industrial site as the remaining pocket of resistance to Russia's relentless bombardment of Mariupol, a southeastern Ukrainian port city strategically located on the Sea of Azov between eastern Ukraine's disputed Donbas region and the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula. Russia claimed Thursday that 1,730 Ukrainian soldiers had surrendered in Mariupol over the previous three days, while Ukraine confirmed Tuesday that more than 250 had yielded in the initial hours after it ordered them to do so.\n\nMariupol is the largest city that Russian forces have seized since launching an invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24. Its complete capture gives Russia total control of the coast of the Sea of Azov as well as a continuous stretch of territory along eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\n\"Staunch Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol since the start of the war means Russian forces in the area must be re-equipped and refurbished before they can be redeployed effectively,\" the U.K. defense ministry said. \"This can be a lengthy process when done thoroughly.\"\n\n\"Russian commanders, however, are under pressure to demonstrably achieve operational objectives,\" the ministry added. \"This means that Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition.\"\n\nMay 20, 6:42 am\n\nBelarus says nearly 28,000 Ukrainians have arrived since Russian invasion\n\nNearly 28,000 Ukrainian citizens have arrived in Belarus since Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, according to the Belarusian State Border Committee.\n\n\"Between 6 a.m. on February 24 and 6 a.m. on May 20, a total of 27,868 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Belarus, including 15,793 who crossed the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, 10,563 by transit through Poland, 1,305 through Lithuania, and 207 through Latvia,\" the committee said in a statement Friday.\n\nIn the past 24 hours alone, 154 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Belarus, including 120 via Poland, according to the committee.\n\nBelarus shares a land border with both Ukraine and Russia, and is Moscow's main ally.\n\nMay 19, 8:07 pm\n\nBiden to sign Ukraine aid bill while abroad\n\nPresident Joe Biden will sign the $40 billion Ukraine aid bill while he's in Asia, a White House official said.\n\n\"The president does intend to sign the bill while he's on the road so that he can sign it expeditiously,\" national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One while en route to the region Thursday evening. \"The modalities of that are being worked right now so that he can get it and sign it.\"\n\nThe bill, which passed the Senate earlier Thursday with bipartisan support, will need to be flown to the region so that Biden can sign it.

the National Guard of Ukraine based in Mariupol, remained at the plant to mount a resistance.\n\nHowever, after weeks of being besieged by the Russian forces, the unit began to suffer from severe

The moves to join NATO were triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nErdo\u011fan has stated numerous times in recent days that Turkey would not support Finland and Sweden to join NATO. The Finnish president said he had an \"open and direct\" conversation with Erdo\u011fan.

On Friday, Russia claimed the last Ukrainian fighters had surrendered -- which, if true, marks a symbolic military victory for Moscow. Ukraine has not yet confirmed this, and CNN is unable to independently verify the claim. It comes after a Ukrainian commander at Azovstal ordered soldiers to preserve their lives and stop their defense of the city. Meanwhile, Ukrainian families anxiously wait to hear from loved ones leaving Azovstal.\n\nZelensky marks third year in office: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the people of Ukraine as the \"people of the year\" in an anniversary interview marking his three years as leader of the country.

Moscow said that its defence minister had informed President Putin of the \"complete liberation\" of the Mariupol steel plant where Ukrainian fighters made their last stand in the city before surrendering in recent days. The Ukrainian authorities said Russia was demining the port at Mariupol in an attempt to get it functioning again. At the same time, Russia said it had destroyed a large consignment of weapons and military equipment near Kyiv and hit a special operations training base outside the Black Sea city of Odesa.\n\nRussia is now waging what appears to be a major offensive in Luhansk, one of two provinces in Donbas. Russian-backed separatists already controlled swathes of territory in Luhansk and the neighbouring Donetsk province before the February 24 invasion, but Moscow wants to seize the last remaining Ukrainian-held territory in Donbas. Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said in a social media post early on Saturday that Russia was trying to destroy the city of Sievierodonetsk, with fighting taking place on the outskirts of the city. \"Shelling continues from morning to the evening and also throughout the night,\" he said.\n\nBut any Russian gains have come at a steep price, and not just in terms of heavy military losses and sanctions that have crippled its economy. Its aggression has increased solidarity within the EU and Nato. Finland and Sweden applied to Nato this week, and on Saturday Russia cut off its gas exports to Finland in a move widely seen as retaliation.\n\nMeanwhile, eager to enact legislation authorising emergency assistance for Ukraine without delay, President Biden directed an aide to fly to South Korea with the physical copy of the measure so he could sign it on Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-91717087,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-150792,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 2, "stanza_neu": 10, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 12, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049923009", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "21:40:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T21:40:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T21:30:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4588235318660736, "url": "https://www.thehoopsnews.com/russia-pounds-ukraine-targeting-supply-of-western-arms-al-jazeera-english-18678", "title": "Russia pounds Ukraine, targeting supply of Western arms - Al Jazeera English", "body": "Kyiv says Russia intensifying its assault with attacks reported on railway stations used to transport Western arms.\n\nRussia has bombarded railway stations and other supply-line points as it accused Western countries of \"stuffing Ukraine with weapons\".\n\nThe Russian military said it used sea- and air-launched missiles to destroy electric power facilities at five railway stations across Ukraine, while artillery and aircraft also struck troop strongholds and fuel and ammunition depots.\n\nAir raid sirens sounded in cities across the country on Wednesday night, and missile fire followed in Cherkasy and Dnipro in central Ukraine and Zaporizhzhia in the southeast. In Dnipro, the mayor said one strike hit the city's centre. There was no immediate word on casualties or damage.\n\nUkrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba accused Russia of \"resorting to the missile terrorism tactics in order to spread fear across Ukraine\".\n\nThe UK's defence ministry said on Wednesday that Russia continues to hit non-military targets in Ukraine including residential properties and transport hubs in a bid to weaken the country's resolve.\n\nIn a regular military intelligence update, the UK also said that despite Russian ground operations focusing on eastern Ukraine, missile strikes continued across the country as Moscow sought to hamper Ukrainian re-supply efforts.\n\n\"As Russian operations have faltered, non-military targets including schools, hospitals, residential properties and transport hubs have continued to be hit, indicating Russia's willingness to target civilian infrastructure in an attempt to weaken Ukrainian resolve,\" the update, posted on Twitter, said.\n\n\"The continued targeting of key cities such as Odessa, Kherson and Mariupol highlights their desire to fully control access to the Black Sea, which would enable them to control Ukraine's sea lines of communication, negatively impacting their economy.\"\n\nHeavy fighting also raged on Wednesday at the Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol that represented the last pocket of Ukrainian resistance in the ruined southern port city, according to the mayor. But a Russian official denied Moscow's troops were storming the plant, as Ukrainian commanders had claimed a day earlier.\n\nThe attacks on rail infrastructure were meant to disrupt the delivery of Western weapons, Russian defense ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said. Defence minister Sergei Shoigu said the West is \"stuffing Ukraine with weapons\".\n\nThe ministry said its forces disabled six railway stations used to supply Western arms to Ukraine's soldiers in the east. It said they also hit 40 military targets including four depots storing ammunition and artillery.\n\nUkraine's defence ministry said Russian strategic bombers fired 18 rockets \"with the aim of damaging our country's transport infrastructure\".\n\nRussia published what it said was video footage of two Kalibr cruise missiles being launched from the Black Sea and said they hit unspecified ground targets in Ukraine.\n\nThe flurry of attacks comes as Russia prepares to celebrate Victory Day on May 9, marking the Soviet Union's defeat of Nazi Germany. The world is watching for whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will use the occasion to declare a victory or expand what he calls a \"special military operation\".\n\nA declaration of all-out war would allow Putin to introduce martial law and mobilise reservists to make up for significant troop losses.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the speculation as \"nonsense\".\n\nMeanwhile, Belarus, which Russia used as a staging ground for its invasion, announced the start of military exercises Wednesday. A top Ukrainian official said the country will be ready to act if Belarus joins the fighting.\n\nA senior US defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagon's assessment, said that while the Russians have tried to hit critical infrastructure around the western city of Lviv, specifically targeting railroads, there has been \"no appreciable impact\" on Ukraine's effort to resupply its forces.\n\nLviv, close to the Polish border, has been a major gateway for NATO-supplied weapons.\n\nWeaponry pouring into Ukraine helped its forces thwart Russia's initial drive to seize Kyiv and seems certain to play a central role in the growing battle for the Donbas, the eastern industrial region that Moscow now says is its main objective.\n\nUkraine has urged the West to ramp up the supply of weapons ahead of that potentially decisive clash. Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, which had been slow at first to help arm Ukraine, said his government is considering supplying howitzers, in addition to Gepard anti-aircraft guns and other equipment it has agreed to send.\n\nThe governor of the eastern Donetsk region, which lies in the Donbas, said Russian attacks left 21 people dead on Tuesday, the highest number of known fatalities since April 8, when a missile attack on the railway station in Kramatorsk killed at least 59.\n\nIn addition to supplying weapons to Ukraine, Europe and the US have sought to punish Moscow with sanctions.

They traveled in a small convoy that crossed through territory held by Russian forces, after the opening of a humanitarian corridor.\n\nAs Thursday draws to a close in Kyiv and in Moscow, here are the key developments of the day:\n\nRussia claimed victory in its bid to take the strategic Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, though some Ukrainian soldiers remain inside the city's steel mill. Russian President Vladimir Putin told his defense minister in a televised meeting not to storm the Azovstal plant with its sprawling tunnels, directing him instead to seal grounds \"so that not even a fly could come through.\" The Ukrainian soldiers previously rejected several Russian calls to surrender. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy said around 120,000 civilians remain stranded in the besieged and destroyed city.\n\nThe U.S. is providing another $800 million in military aid to Ukraine, President Biden said, adding that he plans to ask Congress for more funding next week. The new package includes heavy artillery weapons, ammunition and tactical drones. According to the Pentagon, the new military aid should start reaching Ukraine by the weekend. Leaders from Spain and Denmark, in Kyiv to meet with Zelenskyy, also pledged to send more weapons to Ukraine.\n\nChina maintained its stance of refusing to criticize Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Chinese leader Xi Jinping said his government supports diplomatic talks to resolve international disputes and opposes \"wanton use\" of sanctions.\n\nThe Biden administration announced a new program for Ukrainian refugees to come directly to the U.S. with support from a U.S.-based sponsor. U.S. officials hope the new procedure will discourage Ukrainians from attempting to enter the country from Mexico. The \"Uniting for Ukraine\" program will allow Ukrainian refugees, with financial guarantees from a person or a group in the U.S., to stay in the country for up to two years.\n\nPolish women band together to give Ukrainian women car rides to safe refuge.\n\nUkrainian band DakhaBrakha delivers an urgent message to U.S. audiences.\n\n'Navalny' documentary spotlights the Russian who dared to take on Putin.\n\nAnastasia thinks about leaving Russia.

It's much more difficult for us to even defend our position.\"\n\nThat recalibration may not have solved all the problems that thwarted Kremlin ambitions in the initial weeks of the war, analysts agree. Still, it has allowed the battered Russian military to deliver some of their most painful blows of the war, a bloodletting that has marred the joy even of Ukraine's reclamation of Kharkiv from the invading Russian forces.\n\n\"It's just because of concentration of Russian troops in Donbas. It's not some sort of decisive battle of Kharkiv or whatever,\" the Ukrainian official acknowledged. \"They just moved their troops from Kharkiv because they never had enough troops to keep them in Kharkiv.\"\n\nRUSSIAN STRIKE ON UKRAINIAN BRIDGE RAISES STAKES IN GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS\n\nIf Russian commanders have had some sense knocked into them over the past three months, their battlefield improvement has come just as some Western governments seem inclined to revert to the habits of mind they cultivated in the years prior to Putin's attempt to seize Kyiv. Western European leaders have signaled their desire to end the fighting even if it requires a deal that would frustrate Ukrainian aspirations to recover the territory seized by the Russians, while the U.S. government's decision to provide heavy weapons to Ukraine reportedly is being tempered once more by fear of a confrontation with Putin.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi declared in a statement to Italian lawmakers Thursday that \"a ceasefire must be achieved as soon as possible,\" more than a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed French President Emmanuel Macron urged him to relinquish some territory in the name of peace (an allegation Paris disputed). Draghi's public address coincided with Ukrainian media reports that Italian officials have proposed a ceasefire agreement that would not require Russian forces to withdraw from the Ukrainian land they have seized since the offensive began Feb. 24.\n\n\"More than anyone in the world, we seek peace. But fair peace is crucial for us,\" Ukrainian presidential adviser Andriy Yermak said during a Friday morning event with the Atlantic Council. \"Peace at any cost is not an option for us. We did not start this war. We did not seize foreign territories. But we have to return and will return ours. Ukraine is Kherson, Donetsk, Luhansk, and Sevastopol. Our sovereignty and territorial integrity are not a compromise for us.\"\n\nYermak's remarks Friday morning raised the curtain on political debates that Ukrainian officials are conducting with Western allies, even as Russian forces hammer away at their positions in Donbas.\n\n\"The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue the liberation of the Kharkiv region. But in Donbas, the occupiers are trying to increase pressure,\" Zelensky said in an update released late Thursday evening. \"There's hell, and that's not an exaggeration. The brutal and absolutely pointless bombing of Severodonetsk ... this is a deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible.\"\n\nSeverodonetsk has additional significance as the chief city in the Ukrainian-controlled portion of Luhansk, one of the two regions partitioned by Russian-led separatists at the outset of the war in 2014. \"It is now tough around the Severodonestk area,\" a senior European official told the Washington Examiner. \"Ukrainians need heavy artillery and those kind of things as quickly as possible to survive. And then, if they are able to do it, then they can start to grab back the territories, but first, that's a difficult time there.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden hailed the passage of bipartisan legislation to provide $40 billion in aid to Ukraine this week. That aid foreshadows a huge influx in military assistance, yet the details of the arsenal that funding will provide remain tempered by White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan's misgiving that the provision of too much firepower to Ukraine might provoke Putin, according to two European officials and two former U.S. officials close to the situation.\n\n\"The U.S. wants Ukraine to win, but ... they're not pushing with the full force so that Ukraine could win,\" as a Baltic official put it. \"The White House is a little bit more hesitant on a few fronts, and that's worrisome. ... Each day means the loss of Ukrainian lives -- and not just troops but civilians, and each day means the world is getting more and more accustomed to Ukraine's war, and that's really scary.\"\n\nWhite House officials remain hesitant to provide the kind of long-range weapons systems, known as multiple-launch rocket systems, that would allow Ukrainian artillery to outclass their Russian rivals due to the concern that such deliveries \"could be seen as an escalation by the Kremlin,\" according to a Politico report this week. Yermak took that demand public Friday morning.\n\n\"We are still waiting for them. That should not be the case,\" he said. \"In the first critical stage of the war, we spent too much time negotiating supplies, searching for these weapons. Meanwhile, people stopped tanks with bare hands in our cities. Now that we have a chance to completely liberate Ukraine from the aggressor, it is inadmissible to delay.\"\n\nIf the perception of Western leaders is correct, that they want to help the Ukrainians win but not win too much, then the trans-Atlantic allies could risk trying to strike too delicate a balance if the first Ukrainian official's assessment is correct.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"I don't think a lot of people realize the scale of the problem right now and the scale of our needs,\" the official said. \"Some of the systems are pretty good, and it's very good that we have them, but still, it's a huge, huge concern right now because without ammunition and even despite the ability of Ukrainian troops to continue this fight, for sure it could be a very, very dramatic shift in the current situation.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_gehrke@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Joel Gehrke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c5b7e0f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1288+0+119/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmediadc-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F33%2Fbc%2Fce8f46e241da95529d5e00bb33d5%2Fap22140794844091.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 38, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 49, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049334582", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "08:25:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T08:25:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T08:02:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4588235318660736, "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-claims-liberation-ukraine-mariupol", "title": "Russia claims 'complete liberation' over Ukraine's Mariupol", "body": "National security and military analyst Dr. Rebecca Grant provides the latest on the Russia-Ukraine conflict as Putin's military continues to wither.\n\nRussia now claims Mariupol, Ukraine is entirely under its control following the surrender of Ukrainian forces from the Azovstal steel plant, according to a senior official in the Russian government.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told President Vladimir Putin that Russia's military saw the \"complete liberation\" of the Ukrainian port city, which has been at the center of the Ukraine-Russia War for several weeks.

Most attribute its origins to journalist Peter Arnett's famous Vietnam dispatch for the Associated Press that included the much-misquoted quotation \"It became necessary to destroy the town to save it.\"\n\nWhile the original use of the quote is perhaps a little more complex, it still rings true today especially in Ukraine where it would seem to underpin the contorted logic by which Russia goes about its war there.\n\nIn a rare \"victory\" Russia on Friday claimed to have captured the city of Mariupol after a nearly three-month siege that reduced much of the strategic port city to a smoking ruin, with over 20,000 civilians feared dead.\n\nThe last pocket of Ukrainian resistance in the city's huge Azovstal steel plant with its maze of underground tunnels and galleries constructed during the Soviet era set about evacuating its dead after Kyiv ordered hundreds of its men to surrender to \"save lives\".\n\nIt was a moment the Kremlin has sought to bring about for some time, but one that didn't arrive as hoped for on schedule for Russia's recent May 9 Victory Day celebrations which commemorates the Soviet Union's defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.\n\nThat, however, did not stop Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu milking the surrender at Azovstal for all it was worth and reporting to President Vladimir Putin on the \"complete liberation\" of the steel works and Mariupol as a whole.\n\nJust what exactly Russia was liberating Mariupol from only those in the Kremlin can fathom. It wasn't as if the Ukrainians asked them to come, far from it. Every inch of the way they fought the Russian invaders of their country who time and again justified their aggression that they were on a mission of \"denazification.\"\n\nThat among the defenders of Mariupol were members of the Ukraine's Azov Battalion some of whom had links to the far-right is a fact. For a time after its formation there were legitimate concerns over radicalism within the Azov ranks and the far -right elements were distrusted by much of the Ukrainian public as well as by senior figures in the government.\n\nBut more recently the ranks of the battalion were drawn from the regular Ukraine wide pool of military and national guard recruits. The defenders of Mariupol comprised of Ukrainian marines, the border guard, the army and territorial defence units.\n\nThis though will not stop Moscow from using what they see as a propaganda gift to falsely label many of those who fought in Mariupol as \"far right terrorists\" and create a counter narrative to Ukraine's allegations that many Russian soldiers are war criminals.\n\nIndeed, the first trial of a Russian soldier accused of war crimes took place in Kyiv last week during which Vadim Shysimarin, 21 pleaded guilty to shooting dead an unarmed Ukrainian civilian.\n\nOn many levels Russia's seizure of Mariupol stands as little more than a symbolic 'victory' which many military analysts say offers more propaganda value that it does real strategic gain. It will certainly enable Russia to open the Mariupol port to allow supplies and equipment to flow into the city and on to Russian forces in the Donbas, which is now the main focus of Russia's offensive. But beyond that this no battlefield game changer for the Russians.\n\n\"Although Putin will squeeze maximum domestic propaganda value out of the capture of Mariupol, it is a pyrrhic victory that comes at enormous cost,\" says Robert Person, an associate professor of international relations at the US Military Academy at West Point.\n\n\"The protracted fight for the city has drained Russia's military of significant manpower, weapons, and equipment,\" added Person, speaking to broadcaster RFE/RL last week.\n\nNow all eyes turn toward the Donbas region which Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has described as \"hell\" and \"completely destroyed.\" There villages and towns one after the other are being raised to the ground as Russia, continues with its twisted mission to \"save\" Ukraine by destroying it.\n\nAustralia: The 'bulldozer' and 'builder' battle it out in tight election contest\n\nAs I sat down to write this yesterday morning, polling stations in Australia had already been open for hours.\n\nWith the election on a knife-edge, voters were facing a stark choice for prime minister between the combative conservative incumbent Scott Morrison and opposition Labor Party leader Anthony Albanese.\n\nLater, Albanese was set to become Australia's next prime minister after leading his party to its first election victory in almost a decade.\n\nOne of the country's longest-serving politicians, he promised voters \"safe change\" as he worked to kick out the conservative Liberal-National coalition which has been in power since 2013.\n\nIt's a contest that was portrayed as one between Morrison, who has conceded he had been a \"bit of a bulldozer\" after his personality became an electoral liability and Albanese, who is a \"builder' and promised a more progressive, pragmatic style based on boosting wages and broadening opportunity for Australians.\n\nBut for many Australians the six-week election campaign was largely an attritional slog between two uninspiring leaders, with many voters rejecting both major parties and disillusionment expected to reach a record level in the election.\n\nAustralia's Roy Morgan pollster had already forecast direct support for both major parties would fall below 40 per cent for the first time since 1906, reflecting a sharp rise in backing for independent parties.\n\nAmong these were the leftist Greens, on track for their best electoral result, and right-wing parties such as the United Australia party, which has run on a \"freedom\" campaign to tap into frustration over Covid lockdowns.\n\nBoth the Roy Morgan and the Australian Financial Review polls published on Friday showed Albanese leading by a ratio of 53 to 47, sharply down on the previous week, based on the preference voting system where backing for unsuccessful candidates is redistributed until a winner is declared.\n\nVoting is compulsory in Australia and just over 17.2 million people enrolled to vote, according to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC).\n\nRecord numbers of voters cast their ballots at early voting centres or via postal votes, and more than half of the total votes had been cast by Friday evening, according to the commission. Though national polls indicated Albanese as the likely winner, Morrison was in a similar position when he won three years ago in 2019, so Labor could not afford the luxury of complacency.\n\nSome commentators predicted the race could be followed by a hung parliament, which would make the growing number of independent candidates very important to any bid to form a coalition.\n\nThe Australia that went to the polls yesterday is a very different country from the one that voted in a populist wave in 2019 to keep Morrison's conservative Liberal Party in power. Since then, the country has endured record-setting wildfires and floods, Covid-fuelled isolation, and increasing foreign policy challenges from an assertive China.\n\nThe cost of living has also become a growing worry as house prices soar, inflation rises, and wages stagnate.\n\n\"I want to bring Australians together. I want to seek our common purpose and promote unity and optimism, not fear and division,\" Albanese said in a victory speech on Saturday night.\n\nNorth Korea: Doctrine of 'self-reliance' put to the test by Covid\n\nIt's a country that has largely created its own isolation. Secretive and authoritarian, it's only when the leadership of Kim Jong Un allows do we hear much about North Korea.\n\nThe strategy of cutting itself off has served the regime well, until that is last week when North Korean health authorities admitted their first cases of coronavirus.\n\nNow the Asian nation's official ideology of self-reliance known as \"juche\" is being put to the ultimate test.\n\nAccording to state broadcaster Korean Central Television, as of May 15, there were 240,459 people treated for the \"malignant virus\" in the capital Pyongyang, accounting for roughly 7 per cent of the city's population\n\nBut since then, wider figures show almost 2 million cases of Covid-19 across the country of 25 million people have been reported, although only a handful of patients have officially tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nIn a country where huge swathes of the population are unvaccinated and susceptible to disease due to chronic malnourishment and where a dilapidated healthcare system lacks supplies of basic drugs and equipment, it's hard to overstate the impact the virus will have on North Korea.\n\nThis though has not stopped the country's authorities in the capital Pyongyang from steadfastly refusing offers of international assistance.\n\nBoth the United States and South Korea have so far not received a response to offers to help tackle the outbreak, including by sending aid, according to South Korean officials.\n\nLikewise, the World Health Organisation (WHO), which is \"deeply concerned at the risk of further spread\", said North Korea had not responded to requests for information about the outbreak.\n\nAs is so often the case, Pyongyang appears to have moved in the direction of China for help. According to local press reports in South Korea, aircraft operated by North Korea's national carrier this week flew to China to pick up pandemic supplies and deliver them to Pyongyang.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry said last week that China was \"ready to go all-out to provide support and assistance to North Korea in fighting the virus\".\n\nThe danger here of course as the WHO has pointed out, is that apart from the devastating impact it will have on North Koreans themselves an unchecked spread could give rise to deadlier new variants. Kim's regime it seems is not as isolated or self-reliant as it would like to believe.\n\nTurkey: Erdogan seeks his pound of diplomatic flesh... again\n\nIt's been dubbed a case of 'cold Turkey'. Cold that is in terms of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's response to the proposal that Sweden and Finland join NATO. At the core of Erdogan's objection of course lies Ankara's anger with Sweden over the latter's diplomatic dealings with Kurdish groups operating in Turkey and Syria and granting of asylum to members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which Turkey along with some other countries view as a terrorist organisation.\n\nAs a NATO member, Turkey has the power to veto any new countries seeking to join. NATO enlargement requires unanimous agreement from all current members.\n\nBut what we are witnessing here is classic Erdogan. Never one to miss a political opportunity he sees the crisis over Ukraine as the perfect moment to use his leverage to extract further concession from the West. Or, as the Turkish leader himself expressed it last week, \"The expansion of NATO is meaningful for us, in proportion to the respect that is shown to our sensitivities.\"\n\nErdogan is a past master at driving hard diplomatic bargains a political instinct that has kept him in power for decades. But as some analysts like Asli Ayd\u0131ntasbas, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations points out, it's unlikely that the Turkish leader had one specific policy goal in mind.\n\n\"He will no doubt be expecting to be cajoled, persuaded and eventually rewarded for his cooperation, as in the past,'Ayd\u0131ntasbas told The Spectator magazine last week echoing the views of other experts that Erdogan is simply trying to extract all he can from the crisis.\n\nFor its part Sweden and Finland have pushed back against Erdogan's claims that it is soft on terrorism. In an unusually blunt tweet on Friday, Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde rejected the notion.\n\n\"Due to the vastly spread disinformation about Sweden and PKK, we would like to recall that the Sweden Government of Olof Palme was first after Turkey to list PKK as a terrorist organisation, already in 1984,\" Linde wrote, noting that the EU \"followed suit\" in 2002.\n\nThe whole wrangle has ended up a bit of a diplomatic mess, but few doubt that Erdogan will ultimately agree to NATO membership for Finland and Sweden. It's just that he will, as always, extract his pound of political flesh first.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13805269/", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 19, "stanza_neu": 54, "stanza_pos": 5, "swn_neg": 78, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7047743502", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "01:42:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T01:42:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T01:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4549019634723663, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/05/20/ukraine-news-russia-war-latest-putin-black-sea-nato/", "title": "Russia-Ukraine latest news: Several dead after Russian missiles hit Chernihiv region  ", "body": "US missiles could end Putin's food blockade Chernobyl manager who fled nuclear plant arrested for colluding with Russians Russia takes 'SS division' of Ukraine soldiers to detention camp How Mariupol medic smuggled extraordinary video through Russian checkpoints Listen to the latest episode of our daily Ukraine podcast\n\nSeveral people have been killed in Ukraine's Chernihiv region, north of Kyiv, after the village of Desna was struck by Russian missiles on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said.\n\nAddressing the nation in his nightly video address, President Zelensky called the missile strikes a \"terrible blow\" for Desna, which is located about 40 miles from the border with Belarus.\n\n\"There is an analysis of debris, many dead,\" Mr Zelensky said.\n\n\"(There are) constant strikes on the Odesa region, on the cities of central Ukraine, the Donbas is completely destroyed -- all this has no and cannot have any military explanation for Russia.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian President claimed the strikes were a \"deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible\".\n\nMr Zelensky said Ukrainian troops continued their mission to liberate the Kharkiv region.\n\n\"In Donbas, the occupiers are trying to increase pressure,\" he said.\n\n\"There's hell, and that's not an exaggeration.

Writes Drago Bosnic\n\nOver 770 members of Ukraine's \"Azov Battalion\" Neo-Nazi group have surrendered at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol in the past 24 hours, pushing the total number to 1,730 Ukrainian forces who have laid down their arms, Russian Defense Ministry Spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov stated on Thursday morning.\n\n\"In the past 24 hours, 771 militants of the Azov nationalist battalion holed up in the Azovstal steelworks surrendered. Overall, 1,730 militants, including 80 wounded servicemen, have surrendered since May 16,\" the spokesman said.\n\nThe servicemen of the controversial, to say the least, Ukrainian group who required immediate care are currently receiving medical assistance at hospitals and other health institutions in Novoazovsk and Donetsk, the Russian general said.\n\nThe Defense Ministry of Russia announced on May 17 that members of the Ukrainian Neo-Nazi group, as well as an unspecified number of regular Ukrainian forces sealed off at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, had begun surrendering to Russian and DNR forces since at least the previous day. The battles in and around Mariupol lasted over a month and a half and ended in the victory of the Russian and DPR forces. On April 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on the complete liberation of Mariupol.\n\nRussia's president then handed down an order calling off the initially planned storming of the Azovstal plant, as he considered it pointless and ordered that the industrial zone around the plant be tightly sealed off so that \"even a fly couldn't get through.\" By that time, over 2,000 Ukrainian forces, or approximately a third of the Mariupol's initial garrison were holed up in the steel plant, according to the information provided by the Russian Ministry of Defense.\n\nSince the start of the joint DNR-Russian offensive to secure strategically important areas in and around Mariupol, which is of prime importance for connecting the Donetsk People's Republic and Russia with the Kherson oblast (region) and the Crimean Peninsula to the west and southwest, respectively, the Kiev regime has been desperately trying to portray its forces in the area as some sort of \"heroic last stand die-hards\".\n\nDuring his online sessions with parliaments across EU and NATO member states and other partner countries of the political West, president Zelensky boasted about the \"heroism\" of the forces trapped in the Azovstal steel plant, with his scriptwriters having the task to research any historical last stands of the host countries, resulting in comparisons to the 300 Greek Spartans at Thermopylae, Jewish Masada and the Alamo, among others.\n\nThe comparisons were quite controversial, especially in the cases of Greece and Israel, since the people of both countries suffered tremendously under Nazi German occupation during the Second World War. Greek population during that period was subjected to brutal suppression and mass murder, while Jews were nearly annihilated in the infamous Holocaust, bearing the brunt of the wartime casualties, along with Europe's Slavic (mostly Russian, Polish, Serbian, etc) and Roma population.\n\nThe \"Azov Battalion\" group's direct connection to various Neo-Nazi elements within the Ukrainian society is a direct insult to the memory of the victims subjected to Nazi brutality, even when not taking into account the horrifying testimonies of civilians from Mariupol and other villages, towns and cities in the former Donetsk oblast (region), who were also subjected to nearly a decade of oppression at the hands of the Neo-Nazi group, which culminated in literal mass murder during the recent fighting in the area.\n\nFor nearly two months, the Western mainstream media, citing Ukrainian sources, has been trying to create the \"heroic\" image of the Kiev regime forces who were hiding in the Azovstal steel plant. The members of the Neo-Nazi group were also making regular video calls, pleading and even demanding to be extracted, which was also creating problems for their media-imposed image of \"martyrs\" who would \"rather die than surrender\".\n\nAs the image of \"last stand heroes\" was being built by the mainstream media, forces trapped in the steel plant became increasingly disillusioned, realizing they would be left to die, as they were infinitely more useful as dead \"heroes\" to the Kiev regime. As soon as the Neo-Nazi group and other forces decided to surrender to Russian and DNR forces, the Kiev regime and its Western sponsors realized what sort of a PR disaster this could turn into, especially when coupled with recent major tactical defeats of Ukrainian forces in Donbass.\n\nApart from US pleas the Kiev regime desperately tried to portray the defeat as a \"victory\" by spinning the narrative and resorting to semantics. Thus, the surrender became a \"successful evacuation\", while president Zelensky himself went as far as to claim that Ukrainian services \"successfully evacuated\" the Azovstal forces, without giving any additional information as to which services, since the Kiev regime authorities previously running Mariupol fled the city nearly two months ago.\n\nHowever, president Zelensky and his entourage are desperate to curtail the effect of the surrender, as they fear the image of \"last stand heroes\" they were trying to build in an attempt to boost the morale of Ukrainian troops may very well backfire and cause a cascading effect of mass surrender, which would result in a complete collapse of Ukrainian forces all across the frontlines from Kharkov to Nikolayev.\n\nDrago Bosnic, independent geopolitical and military analyst.\n\nPlease follow Blitz on Google News channel\n\nRecommended for you:", "source": {"uri": "weeklyblitz.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blitz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "editorial_team@weeklyblitz.net", "name": "Editorial Team", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.weeklyblitz.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Zelensky-downplays-surrender-of-Nazi-Al-Qaeda-Azov.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 13, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 26, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049009130", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "23:22:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T23:22:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T21:53:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4470588266849518, "url": "https://www.socialnews.xyz/2022/05/20/russian-forces-completely-liberate-azovstal-steel-plant-in-mariupol/", "title": "Russian forces 'completely liberate' Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol", "body": "Moscow, May 21 (SocialNews.XYZ) Russian forces have \"completely liberated\" the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, the Russian Defence Ministry said.\n\n\"The underground facilities of the enterprise, in which the militants were hiding, are in complete control of the Russian armed forces,\" the Ministry added on Friday in a statement.\n\n\"The last group of 531 militants surrendered today,\" it said, adding that \"a total of 2,439 Azov Nazis and Ukrainian soldiers had laid down their arms since May 16\".\n\nAccording to the statement, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has reported to Russian President Vladimir Putin on the completion of the operation, Xinhua news agency reported.", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://boxoffice.socialnews.xyz/get_ians_img.php.jpg?id=C-1-1475932&txt=Russian+forces+%27completely+liberate%27+Azovstal+steel+plant+in+Mariupol", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 1, "stanza_neu": 4, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 5, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7050059982", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-22", "time": "03:01:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-22T03:01:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-22T02:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4470588266849518, "url": "https://www.thehoopsnews.com/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskyy-says-157-people-from-mariupol-arrive-in-zaporizhzhia-republic-world-18828", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war LIVE: Zelenskyy says 157 people from Mariupol arrive in Zaporizhzhia - Republic World", "body": "SEARCH\n\nQuick links:\n\nIndia News\n\nWorld News\n\nSports News\n\nEntertainment News\n\nTechnology News\n\nShows\n\nBusiness News\n\nElections\n\nImage: AP\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his video address on Facebook, stated that 156 people arrived in Zaporizhzhia.

Hence he looted the country to set himself up with homes in multiple countries and lots of cash in banks which has not been frozen by any country wanting to verify that it all came from his personal earnings.\n\nMore surrendering Azov troops are expected today. I am assuming this is being done a group at a times as the prioners will be going to different locations for care and housing as Pows.\n\nExchanges are expected at some point after the Azov soldiers are screened out from the regular Ukrainian troops.

Dean ]\n\nThe head of the DPR Denis Pushilin claimed that more than half of the militants have already left Azovstal.\n\nOn the other side, the Kiev regimes continues attempts to present the surrender as a \"humanitarian operation\" carried out by the Ukrainian military.\n\nUkrainian President Vladimir Zelensky recorded a video address in which he explained the reasons for the surrender of the Azov regiment. In the video, Zelensky stated that he wanted to protect the people and the country, and that today's surrender of the Ukrainian military was a strategic move. He stated,\n\n\"It's not an easy day. But this day, like all the others, is also about keeping our country and our people safe. Thanks to the actions of the Ukrainian military - AFU (Armed Forces of Ukraine), intelligence, negotiating team, ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) and the UN (United Nations), we hope that we will be able to save the lives of our guys. Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive. This is our principle.\"\n\nOn May 18, Zelensky lied again that the surrender was a humanitarian mission overseen by the Ukrainian military and intelligence officers: The lies were quickly revealed.\n\nThe United Nations did not take part in the removal of the Ukrainian military from the territory of the Azovstal metallurgical plant in Mariupol.\n\nThis was announced on Wednesday at the office of the UN Secretary-General.\n\n\"As I understand, this [the evacuation of the Ukrainian military] was the result of an agreement between the two sides. We did not participate in this,\" said the official representative of the Secretary General of the organization, Stephane Dujarric.\n\nOn May 19, the Russian military confirmed that the representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Ukrainian negotiation group were allowed to visit the surrendered Ukrainian militants and assess the conditions of their detention.\n\nThe delegation came on May 18, two days after the surrender of the first group from Azovstal. The evacuation was headed by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Federation.\n\n\"On May 18, an important event was held as part of the withdrawal of the Azovstal garrison. Representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Ukrainian negotiating group assessed the conditions of detention of Ukrainian prisoners of war in medical institutions of the DPR and in a specially equipped camp, the protection of which was instructed to organize the Federal Penitentiary Service of the Russian Federation.\n\nThe Ukrainian side was represented by People's Deputy of the Verkhovna Rada of the 9th convocation Alexander Ivanovich Kovalev who arrived from Kiev.\n\nAt the beginning, the delegation visited the 15th hospital of the city of Donetsk, which housed seriously wounded prisoners of war who had been taken out of Azovstal days earlier. No one hid anything from the guests. Representatives of the Ukrainian side and the Red Cross were shown the wards where the wounded were housed and given the opportunity to communicate with them.\n\n- It's all right, said the Ukrainian soldier.\n\nAfter visiting the hospital, the delegation went to a camp for the Ukrainian military who had preserved their health. It was organized in Yelenovka in accordance to all the requirements of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Irina Vereshchuk previously offered to place the surrendered in the city of Energodar in the Zaporozhye region, which is under the control of Russia. But she was refused for a number of objective reasons, primarily related to security.\n\nEverything was officially organized: approvals, work calls, a short briefing from the head of the institution and verification of documents. Then everything happened according to a pre-approved plan.\n\nCommunication with the contingent:\n\n- I say again, your goal is to survive. Your loved ones are waiting for you at home.\n\nInspection of places of detention. The Ukrainian negotiators were convinced of the compliance of the Russian side with the agreements reached during the negotiations. They paid attention to the absence of bars on the windows in residential premises.\n\n- Alexander Ivanovich, how do you assess what you saw?\n\n- If we take into account that these are front-line conditions, that only a day has passed, then everything was done quickly, I know that it was done at night. It's better that people themselves say. They say that they have no complaints.\n\nThe delegation visited the accommodation of both men and women. They talked, made sure that no one tortured the prisoners, that no one mocked them. They are fed, treated, and provided with everything they need.\n\n- How do you assess the results of this joint inspection with the Red Cross?\n\n- I think the Red Cross will comment on it for its part. I know how this mission was done. It was very hard. There was a lot of effort on all sides to reach a compromise. I know that during the day everything necessary was delivered here: sleeping accessories, everything to receive people in normal conditions.\n\nWhat we saw today, obviously, everything that was promised was done. Special attention should be paid to the fact that the doctors did a lot of work on the rehabilitation of our wounded during the day.\n\nThe successful operation took place thanks to the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Federation. It was provided by Russian servicemen. On May 19, the release of prisoners of war in Azovstal will continue, which means that the visit of the delegation was completed successfully.\"\n\nThe blockade of the Azov fighters was indeed a strategic maneuver of the Ukrainian military command, since the AFU would be able to regroup on the fronts and distribute its forces, while significant Russian forces were involved in the storming of the facilities.\n\nOn the other hand, the fall of the Ukrainian fortress revealed the bloody tactics of the AFU military command and harmed the morale of the Ukrainian military. For the Russian Federation, this is an important milestone at this stage of the war.\n\nThe fall of Azovstal means the complete control of Mariupol by Russian forces.", "source": {"uri": "veteranstoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Veterans Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_w_dean@veteranstoday.com", "name": "Jim W.

Russia changed its plan after it had failed to take Kyiv.\n\n\"This will be the critical next few weeks of the conflict,\" said Mathieu Boulegue, an expert at London's Chatham House think tank. \"And it depends on how effective they are at conquering Severodonetsk and the lands across it.\"\n\nAs Ukraine's eastern regions feel the full force of Russia's offensive, the loved ones of the Ukrainian fighters who defended the Azovstal steelworks have expressed concern about the fate of their family members after they were ordered to stand down.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference in Istanbul, Turkey, Natalia Zarytska, wife to one of the Mariupol fighters who had surrendered, said she had not had contact with her husband other than a 10-minute message exchange via Telegram two days ago.\n\n\"So my husband messaged me two days ago and the situation is really hard and horrible and my husband is on the way from one hell to another hell, from Azovstal steel plant to a prison, to captivity,\" she said.\n\nMs Zarytska also said she believes that her husband is still alive and that one day he will return home.\n\nThe group, comprising three wives and a mother of Azovstal fighters, have been in Turkey this week to ask the country to help secure the safety of the fighters at the steel plant.\n\nElsewhere, Russia's state-owned energy company Gazprom confirmed on Saturday that it had cut-off gas exports to neighbouring Finland following its bid to join the Nato military alliance.\n\nEarlier, Finnish system operator Gasgrid Finland said: \"Gas imports through Imatra entry point have been stopped.\"\n\nIt comes after Gazprom Export demanded that European countries pay for Russian gas supplies in roubles because of sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine - which Finland has refused to do.\n\nAlthough Finland mainly used Russian-sourced gas, it only accounts for a small percentage of its total energy consumption.\n\nGasum has already indicated that it will fulfil demand through Finland's Balticconnector pipeline with Estonia.\n\nResponding to Russia's move, Mika Wiljanen, the company's chief executive, said: \"It is highly regrettable that natural gas supplies under our supply contract will now be halted.\n\n\"However, we have been carefully preparing for this situation and provided that there will be no disruptions in the gas transmission network, we will be able to supply all our customers with gas in the coming months.\"\n\nIt comes after Joe Biden today signed a bill to provide nearly $40bn (\u00a332bn) in aid for Ukraine as part of efforts to boost military support over Russia's invasion, the White House said.\n\nThe new legislation will provide $20bn in military assistance, ensuring a steady stream of advanced weapons that have been used to stymie Russia's advances.\n\nThere's also $8bn in general economic support, $5bn to address global food shortages that could result from the collapse of Ukrainian agriculture and more than $1bn to help refugees.\n\nBut reports of the staggering support package from the US were somwhat blunted by an announcement from Russia, proclaiming it was banning entry to 963 Americans including President Joe Biden, secretary of State Antony Blinken and CIA chief William Burns.", "source": {"uri": "sg.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gHuToqsrkG.Ty4e_6f4dlg--~B/aD02ODc7dz0xMDI0O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/b357d7b0fa3c8b4a0fbf2da694828e54", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 29, "stanza_pos": 4, "swn_neg": 44, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7049189268", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-21", "time": "05:07:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-21T05:07:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-21T04:40:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4235294163227081, "url": "https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/russia-says-mariupol-battle-at-end-as-ukraini-1513899.html", "title": "Russia Says Mariupol Battle At End As Ukrainian Defenders Surrender - UrduPoint", "body": "Kyiv, Ukraine, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 21st May, 2022 ) :Russia has declared victory in its months-long operation to capture the strategic port of Mariupol after Ukraine ordered the last of its troops holed up in the city's Azovstal steelworks to lay down their arms.\n\nMoscow's flattening of Mariupol has drawn multiple accusations of war crimes, including over a deadly attack on a maternity ward, and Ukraine has begun a legal reckoning for captured Russian troops.\n\nThe first post-invasion trial of a Russian soldier for war crimes neared its climax in Kyiv on Friday, after 21-year-old sergeant Vadim Shishimarin admitted to killing an unarmed civilian early in the offensive.

In the last few months, the siege of Mariupol has witnessed the most thorough destruction of a European city since the bombing of Dresden. In the process of committing numerous war crimes (and likely crimes against humanity), the Russian army leveled the city's housing stock to the ground. The fighting reportedly killed tens of thousands of civilians, and most of the city's nearly half million residents have fled, even as tens of thousands more remain trapped in basements and bunkers under ruins without access to medicine, water, electricity, or basic health care. These include the parents of several of my friends and acquaintances -- incidentally ethnic Jewish and Armenian citizens of Ukraine. One, the Lithuanian filmmaker Mantas Kvedaravi\u010dius, was killed in Mariupol as he was filming the war.\n\nThe Ukrainian army put up remarkable resistance to the Russian invasion of the city, which of course was numerically and technologically superior. In the process, the defenders of Mariupol were reported to have tied down at least 12 Russian battalion tactical groups. After the Russians laid siege to the city, many surviving Ukrainian fighters retreated into the Azovstal iron and steel works, which provided sanctuary to between 1,000 and 2,000 besieged Ukrainian soldiers -- a third of whom were reportedly wounded. These soldiers and service members belonged to the Ukrainian Marines, the Border Guard, the army, and territorial defense battalions, as well as the Azov Battalion.\n\nWhile talks were in progress to free those pinned down in Azovstal over the last few weeks, Russian artillery and cruise missiles continued to bombard the compound daily, and apparently massacred many of the soldiers and civilians taking shelter inside of it. The survivors vowed never to surrender and pleaded with the Ukrainian government and the international community for intervention and extraction. (According to available reports, individual members of the Ukrainian forces who surrendered to the Russians were summarily executed.) On May 11, the wives of Azov soldiers made a trip to the Vatican to plead with Pope Francis for humanitarian intervention.\n\nA Jewish Ukrainian solider within Azovstal, Vitaly Barabash, called upon the Israeli government to intervene, and on May 12, Azov Deputy Commander Svyatoslav Palamar gave an interview to Haaretz playing up the Ukrainian-Israeli connection. (\"Like in Israel, there is also terror against us. We are not Nazis.\") Palamar pleaded for more aide from the Jewish state and the rest of the civilized world to rescue his besieged unit. \"The Azovstal plant is already being compared to Masada,\" Haaretz informed Palamar, \"where Jewish fighters who rebelled against the Roman Empire barricaded themselves in, and in the end all of them were killed.\" Palamar appeared to agree with the analogy -- which is not normative behavior, needless to say, for a \"neo-Nazi\" group.\n\n*snip*", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 9, "stanza_neu": 11, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 22, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7047988235", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "06:57:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T06:57:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T06:34:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4196078479290009, "url": "https://eaworldview.com/2022/05/ukraine-war-russia-kill-many-ukrainians-as-possible/", "title": "Ukraine War, Day 86: Russia's \"Deliberate and Criminal Attempt to Kill as Many Ukrainians as Possible\" - EA WorldView", "body": "EA on ANews: Erdo\u011fan's Bargaining Over Sweden, Finland, and NATO\n\nThursday's Coverage: Zelenskiy -- \"A Complete Failure of Russia's Invasion\"\n\nWith an additional 45 million people facing food insecurity because of its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has rejected an appeal by the UN's World Food Program to lift blockades of Ukrainian ports.\n\nThe WFP's executive director David Beasley addressed Vladimir Putin, \"If you have any heart at all for the rest of the world, regardless of how you feel about Ukraine, you need to open up those ports.\"\n\nDmitry Medvedev, Russia's former President and now Deputy Chairman of the Security Council, responded that Moscow will not allow export of food unless sanctions on Russia are lifted:\n\nThings don't work like that, we're not idiots.\n\nCountries importing our wheat and other food products will have a very difficult time without supplies from Russia.

There's hell, and that's not an exaggeration.\n\nThe brutal and absolutely pointless bombing of Severodonetsk...12 dead and dozens wounded in just one day.

Among the 12 victims were two women in an apartment hit by a missile.\n\n\"Mostly the Russians targeted hits on residential buildings,\" Haidai noted.\n\nAt least 10 civilians, including two children, were killed and seven were injured by Russian attacks in the Donetsk region on Wednesday, said governor Pavlo Kirilenko.\n\nHaidai said the Russians had cut off power with the destruction of an important power substation in Lysychansk, but their ground assaults failed to succeed throughout the area.

Ukrainian officials, however, declined to comment, saying it could endanger rescue efforts.\n\nDenis Pushilin, head of the Russian-backed separatist Donetsk People's Republic, which now encompasses Mariupol, said more than half the Ukrainian fighters had surrendered, and that the uninjured had been taken to a penal colony at Olenivka, near Russian-controlled Donetsk. \"Let them surrender, let them live, let them honestly face the charges for all their crimes,\" he told the Solovyov Live online video channel.\n\nRussia needs the city, one of Ukraine's main seaports, to cement its control of the swathe of land it has seized along Ukraine's coast, reaching all the way west to annexed Crimea.

Pushilin said 200,000 remained, although Ukrainian officials have said it is only half that number. GENEVA CONVENTIONS\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says Mariupol's last defenders - regular soldiers as well as members of the National Guard, to which the Azov Regiment belongs - are national heroes, and that he hopes they can be exchanged for Russian prisoners. Moscow, though, portrays the regiment, which began as an extreme-right nationalist paramilitary organisation, as one of the main perpetrators of the alleged radical anti-Russian nationalism and neo-Nazism which it says threaten Ukraine's Russian-speakers.\n\nThe unit, formed in 2014 as a militia to fight Russian-backed separatists, denies being fascist, racist or neo-Nazi, and Ukraine says it has been reformed away from its radical nationalist origins to be integrated into the armed forces. The Kremlin said the combatants would be treated in line with international norms, though some Russian lawmakers demanded they be put on trial for war crimes and one demanded they face the death penalty.\n\nThe Swiss-based International Committee of the Red Cross, guardian of the Geneva Conventions, said it had registered those leaving the Azovstal plant, in order to keep track of prisoners and stay in touch with their families. It also explicitly set out the rules of the Conventions, the body of international law relating to the treatment of captured military personnel and civilians.\n\n\"Under the 1949 Geneva Conventions, the ICRC must have immediate access to all POWs in all places where they are held,\" it said. \"The ICRC must be allowed to interview prisoners of war without witnesses, and the duration and frequency of these visits should not be unduly restricted.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/03_03_2020_19_07_32_0301512.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 5, "stanza_neu": 15, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 20, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7045351230", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-18", "time": "09:40:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-18T09:40:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-18T09:39:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4156862795352936, "url": "https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/54/1244/466434/War-in-Ukraine/Military/Nearly-%2C-Ukrainian-fighters-left-Mariupol-plant-Ru.aspx", "title": "Nearly 1,000 Ukrainian fighters left Mariupol plant: Russia - Military - War in Ukraine", "body": "Europe's push to cut Russian gas faces a race against winter: AP report\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj.

A huge bonfire raged on a parking space where a group of civilian and military vehicles had parked just minutes before. Anton, our military driver, pushed the accelerator to the floor as we drove past at around 140 kilometers an hour. As we zip down the road, three Ukrainian tanks roll the other way straight to the front line.\n\nThe tiny sliver of Luhansk Oblast still under Ukrainian control is now the center of the increasingly vicious war that is entering its fourth month. On all other fronts, such as Kyiv and Kharkiv, Ukraine has enjoyed a stream of crushing victories, relieving its two main cities from the hell of Russian shelling. But here in the Donbas, Russia's grinding advance continues. The scaling-down of Russia's war aims from a takeover of all Ukraine to an encirclement of Ukraine's troops in this region is little comfort to the men and women who defend the front lines.\n\nIn the distance, plumes of smoke were rising from a series of artillery strikes on Ukrainian critical infrastructure in the area. \"The Russians do in here just what they did in Mariupol... they just destroy the city block by block with artillery,\" a tall, fair-haired Ukrainian major who goes by the nom de guerre 'Spartak' told The Daily Beast on a recent visit to the embattled urban sprawl. The 23-year-old from the western city of Lviv is now the deputy commander of a battalion that has been fighting on the front lines against Russia's remorseless assault on the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine. Soldiers usually avoid giving last names for operational security purposes.\n\nAs artillery thundered all around us, another one of the soldiers -- a major called Roman -- told us that \"today is noticeably quiet here, because the Russian troops have taken Rubizhne near Severodonetsk and are now trying to reposition their forces. When they have done that, they will start again.\"\n\nIt did not sound quiet to us. The constant boom of GRAD rocket launchers and howitzers filled the sky, and the impacts were close enough to shake the earth. Roman pulled out a map on his phone to show us the positions of the Russian forces. He was exhausted from three months of combat on this front, and is pessimistic about Ukrainian prospects in Luhansk. \"If our situation doesn't improve, we could be encircled here.\"\n\nLike the rest of Vladimir Putin's war, this offensive is not going entirely according to plan. In one of the biggest military blunders of the invasion, Russians forces recently tried to throw a pontoon bridge over the Siversky Donets river near Bilhorivka and encircle Ukrainian troops from behind. Ukrainian spotters picked them out and artillery pulverized them, destroying dozens of armored vehicles and killing up to 450 troops. Despite this, Russians continue to make slow and grueling, but very real, gains.\n\nRoman is skeptical that relief is on its way. \"It is my understanding that our goal here is to take the fire on us as much as possible to liberate Kharkiv, the Kherson direction,\" he says with a sigh. \"So, naturally we need to hold out here for some time.\" A common complaint from commanders here is that they have no answer to Russia's overwhelming artillery barrages, which could completely level a town and leave soldiers nowhere to take defensive positions. Western-supplied artillery is reaching the battlefield, but much slower than the Ukrainians would like.\n\nThere is no electricity and or running water, so they drink from a well and use head torches and candles for light. More crucially in an information war, there is no access to the outside world. Russian radio continually broadcasts propaganda about Russian advances throughout the country. At one point, Tatiana Malorezka, a resident, stopped and asked us: \"What is going on? The Russians say they have captured Severodonetsk?!\" When we reassure her that the Ukrainians still hold the city, her relief is palpable. \"My nerves just can't take it anymore, you know? I don't want the Russians to be here!\"\n\nTatiana said she could live under almost any circumstances without power or running water as long as it was under the Ukrainian flag. \"I can never live under Russian occupation,\" she told us. \"It is the only thing that would make me leave.\" She handed us three numbers of family members who have fled to western Ukraine. \"Please call them and tell them that I and the rest of the family are OK,\" she pleaded. One of the numbers was for her son, who is in the army and is fighting on the front line. She hasn't been able to contact him and has no way to know if he is dead or alive.\n\nBack in Slovyansk, we talk to Andrii, a soldier who is more upbeat about Ukraine's chances in the region. \"I think we will recapture Rubizhne soon,\" he says. \"They want to flank from Kharkiv to Luhansk and they want to go down south through Luhansk and those cities. I heard information from our intelligence agencies that the Russians are all demoralized. You must understand the reason. They are fighting only for money and the stupid idea that they are 'liberators.' They are not fucking liberators. We are fighting for our people and our land and that is why we will win.\"\n\nUkrainian officials estimate that there are still thousands of civilians living in the Severodonetsk and Lysychansk urban areas in Luhansk Oblast. They mostly live underground in shelters and bunkers. On the outskirts of a school in Lysychansk is a building that the residents have converted into a shelter. What is most striking is the number of young people who have remained behind there -- there are at least a dozen ranging from infants to older teenagers.\n\nToday, they say, there has been less shelling than before, and the residents have ventured outside. Sixteen-year-old Daniil, who was doing an apprenticeship to be a car mechanic before the war, says that they have barely left the basement in a month due to the shelling that has hit almost every building in Lysychansk -- including their own. Upstairs, one of the parents shows us three rooms in the school. On the table of one of them are two massive shards of a rocket. The rooms almost look normal, but part of the roof is missing, and the supply closet is a wreck covered in rubble.\n\nAs we leave, we take three women who have decided to evacuate to the relative safety of Lysychansk in our car with us. One is 19-year-old Valeria, who was a university student in Kharkiv when the war broke out. Rather than fleeing the region altogether, she wants to go straight to her grandmother in Lysychansk to look after her. \"My parents died when I was young, and she is all I have left,\" Valeria says.\n\nWhen we ask her what she thinks of the war, she says that she \"does not understand how this could happen.

Russian forces have, however, been pushed back this month from the outskirts of the second-largest city Kharkiv. Ukraine says it has recaptured 23 settlements near Kharkiv in the last two weeks. As the invasion nears the three-month mark, the Group of Seven rich nations agreed to provide Ukraine with $18.4 billion to pay its bills. Ukraine said the money would speed up victory over Russia and was just as important as \"the weapons you provide.\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters: \"The message was, 'We stand behind Ukraine.

The White House is working to put advanced anti-ship missiles in the hands of Ukrainian fighters to help defeat Russia's naval blockade, officials said.

Today, this package was passed by the US Senate. It is a manifestation of strong leadership and a necessary contribution to our common defense of freedom.\n\nA meeting of finance ministers, heads of G7 central banks and representatives of international donors also took place in Germany.\n\nI always say frankly: the monthly budget deficit in Ukraine now is $ 5 billion. And to endure the war for freedom, we need quick and sufficient financial support.\n\nAnd it's not just expenditures or a gift from partners. This is their contribution to their own security.\n\nBecause the defense of Ukraine also means their defense from new wars and crises that Russia may provoke. If it succeeds in the war against Ukraine. That is why we must all work together to ensure that there is no success for Russia in its aggression against our state. Neither military, nor economic, nor any other.\n\nI spoke today with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. I personally thanked her for the macro-financial assistance in the amount of 9 billion euros, this package was proposed the day before.\n\nI also spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. On economic issues, in particular on the export of our agricultural products and fuel imports. And also about the situation in the areas of hostilities and the evacuation of our heroes from Azovstal. I am doing my best to keep the most influential international forces informed and, as much as possible, involved in rescuing our military.\n\nI addressed students of Ukrainian universities. And it was a special address.\n\nI hope it will be heard not only by students. Because now is the time when we have the opportunity to build the future for Ukraine that we really want. Our future, Ukrainian future. Without any obsolete and toxic things that have nothing to do with our national needs and our character. Ukraine has become the master of its own life and must decide for itself how to live.\n\nIn total, students of 25 Ukrainian universities took part in today's meeting. Geography is quite wide: Kyiv, Bila Tserkva, Mariupol, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Lviv, Kryvyi Rih, Donetsk, Kherson, Ivano-Frankivsk, Horlivka, Dnipro.\n\nNot all universities operate in their cities. Some of them moved. But what was nice and right - students and rectors are confident that Ukraine will win and restore free life throughout the territory.\n\nImportant current issues were also discussed. Firstly, I instructed the Minister of Education to prepare changes that will allow applicants from all temporarily occupied territories to enter Ukrainian universities under a simplified procedure.\n\nSecondly, I instructed the Minister to decide how to ensure the education of those students who study under contract, but come from the currently occupied territories. Obviously, it is extremely difficult to pay for a contract to study in such conditions. The state must help. Therefore, I expect relevant decisions from the Minister, the Government and, if necessary, the people's deputies.\n\nWe talked with students about post-war reconstruction and how to guarantee the security of our state for decades to come.\n\nThe Armed Forces of Ukraine continue the liberation of the Kharkiv region. But in Donbas, the occupiers are trying to increase pressure. There's hell, and that's not an exaggeration.\n\nThe brutal and absolutely pointless bombing of Severodonetsk... 12 dead and dozens wounded in just one day. The bombing and shelling of other cities, the air and missile strikes of the Russian army - all this is not just hostilities during the war.\n\nRussian strikes at the Chernihiv region, in particular the terrible strike at Desna, debris clearance continues, many dead; constant strikes at the Odesa region, at the cities of central Ukraine, Donbas is completely destroyed - all this doesn't and cannot have any military explanation for Russia.\n\nThis is a deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible. Destroy as many houses, social facilities and enterprises as possible.\n\nThis is what will be qualified as the genocide of the Ukrainian people and for which the occupiers will definitely be brought to justice.\n\nThe first trial in Ukraine against a Russian war criminal has already begun. And it will end with the full restoration of justice within the international tribunal. I'm sure of it.\n\nWe will find and bring to justice all those who give and carry out criminal orders.\n\nToday I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 210 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 48 of them posthumously. The title of Hero of Ukraine was posthumously awarded to Captain Serhiy Parkhomenko, commander of the aviation unit of the 299th tactical aviation brigade.\n\nEternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine!", "source": {"uri": "ukrinform.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ukrinform-EN"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.ukrinform.com/photos/2022_05/thumb_files/630_360_1653016743-219.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 97, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 38, "stanza_pos": 7, "swn_neg": 57, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7046943956", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-19", "time": "11:56:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-19T11:56:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-19T11:56:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.3803921639919281, "url": "http://alriyadhdaily.com/article/5860ad98ac564b0cb2594ac2580d7bb7", "title": "More than half of Ukrainian fighters have left Azovstal, pro-Russian separatist leader says", "body": "More than half of Ukrainian fighters have left Azovstal, pro-Russian separatist leader says\n\nMore than half the Ukrainian fighters in the bunkers below the Azovstal steel plant have surrendered, the leader of the Russian-backed rebel Donetsk region said on Thursday (May 19), and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is registering them.\n\nThe most devastating siege in Russia's invasion is drawing to a close after nearly 1,000 Ukrainian fighters laid down their arms this week, giving themselves up to pro-Russian forces.\n\nThe ICRC said it had registered those surrendering from the plant so that it can track them and ensure their families can remain in contact with them after their capture.\n\nThe wounded have been given medical treatment while those who are fit have been taken to a penal colony and are being treated well, said Denis Pushilin, head of the breakaway Donetsk People's Republic.\n\n\"More than a half have already left - more than half have laid down their arms,\" Pushilin told the Solovyov Live Internet television channel.\n\n\"Let them surrender, let them live, let them honestly face the charges for all their crimes,\" Pushilin said.\n\nUkrainian officials have declined to comment publicly on the fate of the fighters, saying it could endanger rescue efforts.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy casts the fighters - which include Ukrainian army soldiers and members of the Azov Regiment - as heroic defenders of the motherland against foreign occupiers.\n\nRussia, though, says the Azov Regiment, which began as an extreme-right nationalist paramilitary organisation, is a group of radically anti-Russian nationalist fighters and casts them as modern-day Nazi sympathisers.\n\nThe regiment, formed in 2014 as a militia to fight Russian-backed separatists, denies being fascist, racist or neo-Nazi, and Ukraine says it has been reformed away from its radical nationalist origins to be integrated into the National Guard.\n\nAsked about reports that Captain Sviatoslav Palamar, 39, a deputy commander of the Azov Regiment, had surrendered, Pushilin declined comment.

Today, this package was passed by the US Senate. It is a manifestation of strong leadership and a necessary contribution to our common defense of freedom.\n\nA meeting of finance ministers, heads of G7 central banks and representatives of international donors also took place in Germany.\n\nI always say frankly: the monthly budget deficit in Ukraine now is $ 5 billion. And to endure the war for freedom, we need quick and sufficient financial support.\n\nAnd it's not just expenditures or a gift from partners. This is their contribution to their own security.\n\nBecause the defense of Ukraine also means their defense from new wars and crises that Russia may provoke. If it succeeds in the war against Ukraine. That is why we must all work together to ensure that there is no success for Russia in its aggression against our state. Neither military, nor economic, nor any other.\n\nI spoke today with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. I personally thanked her for the macro-financial assistance in the amount of 9 billion euros, this package was proposed the day before.\n\nI also spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. On economic issues, in particular on the export of our agricultural products and fuel imports. And also about the situation in the areas of hostilities and the evacuation of our heroes from Azovstal. I am doing my best to keep the most influential international forces informed and, as much as possible, involved in rescuing our military.\n\nI addressed students of Ukrainian universities. And it was a special address.\n\nI hope it will be heard not only by students. Because now is the time when we have the opportunity to build the future for Ukraine that we really want. Our future, Ukrainian future. Without any obsolete and toxic things that have nothing to do with our national needs and our character. Ukraine has become the master of its own life and must decide for itself how to live.\n\nIn total, students of 25 Ukrainian universities took part in today's meeting. The geography is quite wide: Kyiv, Bila Tserkva, Mariupol, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Lviv, Kryvyi Rih, Donetsk, Kherson, Ivano-Frankivsk, Horlivka, Dnipro.\n\nNot all universities operate in their cities. Some of them moved. But what was nice and right - students and rectors are confident that Ukraine will win and restore free life throughout the territory.\n\nImportant current issues were also discussed. Firstly, I instructed the Minister of Education to prepare changes that will allow applicants from all temporarily occupied territories to enter Ukrainian universities under a simplified procedure.\n\nSecondly, I instructed the Minister to decide how to ensure the education of those students who study under contract, but come from the currently occupied territories. Obviously, it is extremely difficult to pay for a contract to study in such conditions. The state must help. Therefore, I expect relevant decisions from the Minister, the Government and, if necessary, the people's deputies.\n\nWe talked with students about post-war reconstruction and how to guarantee the security of our state for decades to come.\n\nThe Armed Forces of Ukraine continue the liberation of the Kharkiv region. But in Donbas, the occupiers are trying to increase pressure. There's hell, and that's not an exaggeration.\n\nThe brutal and absolutely pointless bombing of Severodonetsk... 12 dead and dozens wounded in just one day. The bombing and shelling of other cities, the air and missile strikes of the Russian army - all this is not just hostilities during the war.\n\nRussian strikes at the Chernihiv region, in particular the terrible strike at Desna, debris clearance continues, many dead; constant strikes at the Odesa region, at the cities of central Ukraine, Donbas is completely destroyed - all this doesn't and cannot have any military explanation for Russia.\n\nThis is a deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible. Destroy as many houses, social facilities and enterprises as possible.\n\nThis is what will be qualified as the genocide of the Ukrainian people and for which the occupiers will definitely be brought to justice.\n\nThe first trial in Ukraine against a Russian war criminal has already begun. And it will end with the full restoration of justice within the international tribunal. I'm sure of it.\n\nWe will find and bring to justice all those who give and carry out criminal orders.\n\nToday I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 210 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 48 of them posthumously. The title of Hero of Ukraine was posthumously awarded to Captain Serhiy Parkhomenko, commander of the aviation unit of the 299th tactical aviation brigade.", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.kyivpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelensky-may19.2022.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 94, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 37, "stanza_pos": 7, "swn_neg": 55, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7046609484", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-19", "time": "07:27:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-19T07:27:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-19T07:27:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.364705890417099, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-05-19-22/h_701f9acf7f067067318419a2e729f285", "title": "Russia says more than 900 Ukrainian soldiers from Azovstal sent to pretrial detention center ", "body": "The Russian Foreign Ministry said more than 900 Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol since May 16 have been sent to a pretrial detention center.\n\nMinistry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday that a total of 959 Ukrainian soldiers, including 51 with severe wounds, had surrendered over the course of two days.\n\nShe reaffirmed the injured are receiving treatment at the hospital at Novoazovsk in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), while the others were sent to a pretrial detention center in Olenivka, a town near the front lines but in territory controlled by the DPR.\n\nCNN is unable to confirm the Russian tally.\n\nThe Ukrainian side has not given an update on the number who have left Azovstal nor on the status of negotiations for their exchange for Russian prisoners.\n\nAmnesty International has said Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered at the steel plant must not be ill-treated and should receive immediate access to the International Red Cross.", "source": {"uri": "edition.cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "a_href@edition.cnn.com", "name": "A Href=\"", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "helen_regan_helen_regan@edition.cnn.com", "name": "helen-regan\">Helen Regan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/d86692ef-84eb-4a26-b513-ccd8258bfd8c.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 93, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 2, "stanza_neu": 3, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 6, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7048190631", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "09:54:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T09:54:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T09:53:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.364705890417099, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-may-redeploy-mariupol-troops-fast-desperation-uk-intel-2022-5", "title": "Russia is desperate for more soldiers and likely to redeploy troops too quickly after Mariupol siege, UK intel says", "body": "By clicking 'Sign up', you agree to receive marketing emails from Insider as well as other partner offers and accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nRussian commanders are likely to rush exhausted soldiers back into the field after their lengthy assault on Mariupol, leaving them improperly equipped and at risk, UK intelligence said.\n\nEarlier this week Ukraine ordered many soldiers holding out in a steel plant in the city to surrender.\n\nUK intelligence estimated that around 1,7000 soldiers surrendered.

And with good reason.\n\nSeverodonetsk, the town at the other end of this road, is the last Ukraine-controlled foothold in the Luhansk region and the epicentre of a bitter, weeks-long battle that Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, on Thursday said threatens to completely destroy this region.\n\nAnd the Russians on Friday stepped up their efforts to cut it off, threatening an encirclement.\n\n\"In Donbas, the occupiers are trying to increase pressure,\" he said in his nightly video address. \"There's hell, and that's not an exaggeration.\"\n\nIn March, after their assault on Kyiv had clearly failed, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and his generals declared more limited war aims for their invasion of Ukraine - the \"liberation\" of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the two eastern coal-producing provinces together known as the Donbas.\n\nTheir grand offensive to achieve that began a month ago, sparking a battle that can be compared in geographic scale to those of the Second World War.\n\nThe main Russian effort in the Donetsk region has largely stalled around the town of Izyum in the face of determined Ukrainian resistance.\n\nIn the Luhansk region, Severodonetsk and Lisichansk - its sister town on the opposite bank of the Siverny Donets river - have become a mini-Verdun, drawing in ever-increasing numbers of troops from both sides as the Ukrainians try to hold up the slow but inexorable Russian advance.\n\nIf they fall, the Russians will quickly be able to say they have \"liberated\" the Luhansk region, achieving at least one of Putin's war aims.\n\nAnd they are pouring vast amounts of men and firepower into the effort to cut this last, slender supply line.\n\nThey already have artillery within range of the road and Serhiy Haidai, governor of what is left of the Ukrainian-controlled Luhansk region, said it is \"50-50\" whether daily humanitarian convoys of armoured cars come under fire.\n\nOn Friday morning, there were reports that a Russian breakthrough from Popasna, to the east, had brought them within a few kilometres of the road.\n\nMr Haidai denied that in the afternoon, telling The Telegraph that there had been no breakthrough and the situation was \"very serious but stable\".\n\nBut he confirmed Ukraine's ability to keep the road open is increasingly precarious. \"The shelling is the problem,\" he said. \"We have all the humanitarian aid we need, if only we can deliver it.\"\n\nWhen Mr Zelensky spoke of hell, he was not exaggerating.\n\nThe human costs of the vast artillery duel unfolding across the Donbas, where shrapnel and shockwaves are more feared than bullets, are mounting rapidly.\n\nIn a military hospital behind the lines on Friday, surgeons and nurses scrambled to load and unload newly-arrived casualties, while the walking wounded smoked cigarettes outside.\n\nProne men under aluminium shock blankets arrived on stretchers. A soldier, his face twisted in agony, leaned on a comrade to limp into the overcrowded trauma unit.\n\nThe civilian cost is no less grim.\n\nTwelve people were killed in Severodonetsk on Thursday.\n\nOn Friday morning, three more died when a school - the basement of which was being used as a shelter - was hit, Mr Haidai said.\n\n\"I've got a video, if you like,\" he said, offering his phone. \"But why would you want to see it? There's been so many of those videos.\" The shock of seeing neighbours and friends dismembered by explosives was an aspect of the war that had a particular impact on people, he reflected.\n\nThere have been plenty of examples in those towns to draw that lesson from over the past three months.\n\nAbout 50,000 civilians remain in Ukrainian held territory, he said. They are largely a mixture of elderly people who refuse to move, those who stayed because they could not quite conceive that \"it could happen to them\" and a small number of people with separatist sympathies who would welcome the \"Russian world\", he said.\n\nBut the destruction is not confined to the very frontline.\n\nThe long-range artillery, cruise missiles, airstrikes and drones that define this war can deliver ordnance almost anywhere across the 50-mile wide Donbas salient.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Lyudmila Vyshepan had just finished checking on her daughter's empty apartment in Bakhmut when she heard a loud explosion announcing another strike had landed somewhere in the city.\n\n\"I was down the stairs and the door had already shut when I heard it. But I didn't think it was around here,\" she said on Friday.\n\nBut sound can play strange tricks. When she rounded the corner, she found that an airstrike had taken out not only the flat she had just left, but the entire five-storey section of the block of which it was a part.\n\nBy a miracle, neighbours said, no one was seriously hurt in the strike on number four Vasila Pershina street.\n\nSome, like Mrs Vyshepan's daughter and her family, had already evacuated Donbas.\n\nIn the ground-floor flat, Tania Berizhnya was shaken awake, but like Mrs Vyshepan assumed the explosion had happened somewhere else - until she saw that her balcony was hanging off.\n\nShe and her mother have resolved to leave. Mrs Vyshepan, like many people of her age, is refusing to.\n\n\"I'm not going anywhere. What will be, will be,\" she said as she took a break from removing furniture from the precarious ruins of the flat, now without a wall or a kitchen.\n\n\"We will take this stuff to our place. They were so proud of this flat, spent two years renovating it. A new gas cooker, the floor,\" she added, holding back tears.\n\nBakhmut today is not yet a frontline city. The nightmare at Severodonetsk is 40 miles away.\n\nOn the market square, soldiers shop for lunch among civilians from neighbouring towns waiting for evacuation buses.\n\nBut it could become a much more dangerous place in the weeks to come.\n\nThe Russian advance in this area may be slow, but it is undeniably making progress.\n\nThe prospect of the road being cut and Severodonetsk becoming encircled and eventually falling is \"unpleasant, but I am an adult. I understand it could happen\", said Mr Haidai.\n\nHe himself is already something of a refugee, unable to operate in his own region and trying to do what he can to coordinate humanitarian efforts by phone from the neighbouring Donetsk region.\n\nBut he does not like the idea of giving up.\n\n\"What are they meant to do? It's war. Our forces are tying down a great number of enemy troops there,\" he said when asked whether it was time to consider a withdrawal of both civilians and troops threatened with encirclement.\n\n\"The Russians are determined to take it so they can say an objective was given and finally they have some kind of result. At least some kind of result. And the longer we can hold on there - or just hold on to even one or two towns in the Luhansk region - the longer we deny them that.\"\n\nIf Donbas can hold out through June and July, he said, it will buy enough time for Ukraine to train new regiments and re-equip with western equipment in preparation for a strategic counter offensive to defeat the invasion.\n\nLike many Ukrainian officials, he believes that is not only possible - but the only way to end the war.\n\n\"Putin talks about demilitarisation. It's essential Russia is demilitarised. Because,\" he added, coming close to losing his temper: \"It's a rabid beast. A rabid beast. And it's impossible to stop fighting, because it won't stop in Ukraine.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "roland_oliphant@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Roland Oliphant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2022/05/20/TELEMMGLPICT000296746467_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "eventUri": "eng-7724776", "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 86, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 28, "stanza_neu": 44, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 74, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7047858808", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-05-20", "time": "04:31:00", "dateTime": "2022-05-20T04:31:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-05-20T04:17:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.3372549116611481, "url": "https://en.prothomalo.com/international/europe/hell-in-ukraines-donbas-as-russia-piles-on-pressure-warns-zelenskiy", "title": "'Hell' in Ukraine's Donbas as Russia piles on pressure, warns Zelenskiy", "body": "A serviceman of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) walks at the damaged war memorial complex Savur-Mohyla during a ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Donbas region from the Nazi occupation during World War Two, outside the rebel-held city of Donetsk, Ukraine on 7 September, 2018AFP\n\nUkraine's industrial Donbas region, the focus of recent Russian offensives, has been destroyed, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said as some of the world's richest countries pledged to bolster Kyiv with billions of dollars.\n\nSince turning away from Ukraine's capital, Russia is using massed artillery and armour to try to capture more territory in the Donbas, comprised of the Donetsk and Luhansk areas, which Moscow claims on behalf of separatists.\n\n\"The occupiers are trying to exert even more pressure.
