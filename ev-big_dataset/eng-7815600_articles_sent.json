Vilnius said it was simply applying European Union sanctions.\n\n- 'Toughest days' -\n\nSince failing to capture Kyiv early in the war, Russian troops have focused on the eastern Donbas region, where they have been gaining ground.\n\nRussian shelling has continued in and around the eastern city of Lysychansk, after Russian forces at the weekend took its twin city, the industrial hub Severodonetsk, after weeks of fierce fighting.\n\nTaking Lysychansk would give Russia control of the entire Lugansk region of the Donbas.\n\nSweeping Western sanctions designed to choke off Moscow's access to the international financial system have pushed Russia closer to its first foreign debt default in a century.\n\nRussia said Monday that two of its debt payments had been prevented from reaching creditors after a key deadline expired.\n\nBut \"there are no grounds to call this situation a default\", Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.", "source": {"uri": "thefrontierpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Frontier Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/16-shoppers-killed-in-Russian-missile-strike-on-crowded-Ukrainian-mall.jpg?fit=301%2C168&ssl=1", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 24, "stanza_neu": 47, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 72, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094198096", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "01:51:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T01:51:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T01:50:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7372549176216125, "url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/world/russia-ukraine-war/story/russian-missile-strike-ukraine-mall-fatalities-1967478-2022-06-28", "title": "At least 16 killed by Russian missile strike at Ukraine mall", "body": "A Russian missile strike on a crowded mall in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk killed at least 16 people, the head of emergency services said early Tuesday, sparking international outrage.\n\n\"The Russian strike today on the shopping centre in Kremenchuk is one of the most brazen terrorist acts in European history,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening broadcast posted on Telegram.\n\nEmergency services chief Sergiy Kruk said the main tasks were \"rescue work, debris removal and the elimination of fires\" following Monday's strike on the shopping centre.\n\n\"As of now, we know of 16 dead and 59 wounded, 25 of them hospitalised.

AP PHOTO\n\nKREMENCHUK, Ukraine: Rescuers on Tuesday searched through the charred rubble of a shopping mall in central Ukraine to look for more victims of a Russian missile strike that killed at least 18 people and wounded scores in what the country's leader called \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said many of the more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers inside the mall in the city of Kremenchuk managed to escape. Giant plumes of black smoke, dust and orange flames billowed from the wreckage as emergency crews combed through broken metal and concrete for victims. Drones whirred above, clouds of dark smoke still emanating from the ruins several hours after the fire was extinguished.\n\nCasualty figures rose as rescuers sifted through the smoldering rubble. Poltava Gov. Dmytro Lunin, whose region includes the city, said at least 18 people were killed and emergency services reported over 60 wounded.\n\n\"We are working to dismantle the construction so that it is possible to get machinery in there since the metal elements are very heavy and big, and disassembling them by hand is impossible,\" said Volodymyr Hychkan, an emergency services official.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times' daily newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the United Nations Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting at its headquarters in New York City on Tuesday to discuss the attack.\n\nIn the first Russian government comment on the missile strike, the country's first deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, alleged multiple inconsistencies that he didn't specify, claiming on Twitter that the incident was a provocation by Ukraine.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly denied it targets civilian infrastructure, even though Russian attacks have hit other shopping malls, theaters, hospitals, kindergartens and apartment buildings in the four-month war.\n\nThe strike occurred as Western leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and the world's major economies prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States appeared ready to respond to Zelenskyy's call for more air defense systems, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization planned to increase the size of its rapid-reaction forces nearly eightfold, to 300,000 troops.\n\nZelenskyy said the mall presented \"no threat to the Russian army\" and had \"no strategic value.\" He accused Russia of sabotaging \"people's attempts to live a normal life, which make the occupiers so angry.\"\n\nIn his nightly address, the Ukrainian leader said it appeared Russian forces had intentionally targeted the shopping center, adding that the \"Russian strike at a shopping mall in Kremenchuk is one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\"\n\nRussia \"has become the largest terrorist organization in the world,\" he said.\n\nRussia has increasingly used long-range bombers in the war. Ukrainian officials said Russian Tu-22M3 long-range bombers flying over Russia's western Kursk region fired the missiles, one of which hit the shopping center and another that struck a sports arena in Kremenchuk.\n\nThe strike echoed earlier attacks that resulted in large numbers of civilian casualties. These include the one in March on a Mariupol theater, where many civilians had holed up, killing an estimated 600; and another in April on a train station in eastern Kramatorsk that left at least 59 people dead.\n\n\"Russia continues to take out its impotence on ordinary civilians. It is useless to hope for decency and humanity on its part,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe UN called the strike \"deplorable,\" stressing that civilian infrastructure \"should never ever be targeted,\" UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Group of Seven leaders condemned the attack in a statement on Monday night, saying \"indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.

Serhiy Gaidai.

It was part of an unusually intense barrage of Russian fire across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv, that renewed international attention as the war drags on.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G7 summit in Germany, French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven leading industrialised democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\"\n\n\"Russia cannot and should not win,\" he said. He called Monday's attack on the mall \"a new war crime\".\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian officials claimed the shopping centre was not the target.\n\nIn a virtual address to the UN Security Council, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being a \"terrorist\" and called for Russia to be expelled from the United Nations. He also urged the UN to establish an international tribunal to investigate Russia's action in Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy ended his address by asking all in the chamber to stand in silent tribute to the \"tens of thousands\" of Ukrainian children and adults killed in the war. All council members rose, including Russia's deputy UN ambassador Dmitry Polyansky.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Service firefighters work to take away debris at a shopping centre burned after a rocket attack in Kremenchuk, Ukraine. Photo / AP\n\nHow to counter Russia and back Ukraine will also be the focus of a summit this week of the Nato alliance, whose support has been critical to Kyiv's ability to fend off Moscow's larger and better-equipped forces. Ukrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to hold off and even drive back Russia, which is pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.\n\nAs Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall, which officials said was struck when more than 1000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when an explosion knocked her down. When another blast came about 10 minutes later, she realised she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicentre with all of my strength,\" she said. Fighting back tears, she added: \"You have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said. Several of the bodies of those who didn't make it out in time were burned beyond recognition, he said.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Service firefighters work to take away debris at a shopping centre burned after a rocket attack in Kremenchuk, Ukraine. Photo / AP\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded, and 21 people were still missing.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theatre, a train station, and a hospital. Zelenskyy called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history\".\n\nRocket attacks continued elsewhere in Ukraine. Authorities in the city of Dnipro said workers at a diesel car repair shop were trapped in rubble after a strike from a cruise missile fired from the Black Sea, Ukrainian news agencies reported. The Ukrainian military managed to intercept and destroy other missiles fired at the city, the agencies said.\n\nAs condemnation came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfilled its goals. He said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognising its control over the territory it has taken by force.\n\nA hospital nurse pushes a wheelchair carrying a woman wounded by the Russian deadly rocket attack at a shopping centre. Photo / AP\n\nRussian Defence Ministry spokesman Lt Gen Igor Konashenkov claimed warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire. Ukrainian authorities said that in addition to the direct hit on the mall, a factory was struck, but denied it housed weapons.\n\nKonashenkov also falsely alleged the mall was not in use.\n\nOne survivor, Oleksandr, a mall employee, told the AP from a hospital bed the shopping centre was packed with customers. He recalled stepping outside with a colleague for a cigarette when the air raid siren went off.\n\n\"There was a black tunnel, smoke, fire,\" he said. \"I started to crawl. I saw the sun up there, and my brain was telling me I needed to save myself.\"\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity\". She emphasised the need for all Ukrainians to remain alert and expect a similar strike \"every minute\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. Six more people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire came as the G7 leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defence systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. Nato's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of a summit starting this week in Madrid, and an early signal of unity came on Tuesday when Turkey agreed to lift its opposition to Sweden and Finland joining Nato.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Service firefighters work to take away debris at a shopping centre burned after a rocket attack in Kremenchuk, Ukraine. Photo / AP\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine prompted the two Nordic countries to abandon their long-held nonaligned status and apply to join Nato. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had blocked the move, insisting they change their stance on Kurdish rebel groups that Turkey considers terrorists.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the West that \"the more weapons are pumped into Ukraine, the longer the conflict will continue and the longer the agony of the Nazi regime backed by Western capitals will last\".\n\nRussia has falsely called the war a campaign to \"de-Nazify\" Ukraine -- a country with a democratically elected Jewish president who wants closer ties with the West.\n\nIn a sinister message to Nato leaders, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where their summit will be held.\n\nIt also posted images and the coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin -- referring to them as \"decision-making centres supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app. That wording echoes Putin's warnings he could target such centres in response to what he has called Western aggression.\n\nIn other developments, the two fighting countries continued a sporadic series of prisoner exchanges. Ukraine exchanged 15 Russian prisoners of war for 16 Ukrainian soldiers and one civilian, the Ukrainian Pravda news outlet reported on Tuesday.\n\nUkrainian Pravda also reported that in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, the mayor was detained Tuesday and occupying authorities seized his computer hard drive and documents after he had refused to cooperate with Russian-appointed local officials. Russia's Tass news agency confirmed the detention.\n\nMeanwhile, Bulgaria said on Tuesday it was expelling 70 Russian diplomats designated \"a threat to national security,\" ordering them to leave within five days. A Bulgarian foreign ministry statement said this would reduce Russia's Sofia embassy staff \"to up to 23 diplomatic and 25 administrative and technical staff.\"", "source": {"uri": "newstalkzb.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewstalkZB"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@newstalkzb.co.nz", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "image": "https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/media/mpbfp3ru/ukraine-mall-attack-memorial-ap.jfif?rmode=crop&rnd=133009914187830000&height=395&width=635&quality=95&scale=both", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 16, "stanza_neu": 52, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 69, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093944104", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "19:27:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T19:27:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T19:27:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7098039388656616, "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ae925212-c363-439e-8b37-99ebd58cb960", "title": "Russian missile strike on Ukraine shopping mall draws outcry", "body": "A Russian missile hit a busy shopping mall in central Ukraine on Monday, triggering a blaze in which the number of dead may be \"impossible to imagine\", said the country's president.\n\nHours after Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded with G7 leaders for more missile defence systems following a series of attacks at the weekend, Ukraine's president posted a video on Telegram of the missile attack in Kremenchuk, about 320km south-east of Kyiv on the Dnipro River, that showed the shopping mall ablaze.\n\n\"The occupiers fired missiles at the mall, where there were more than a thousand civilians,\" Zelenskyy said in the post.\n\n\"The mall is on fire, rescuers are fighting the fire, the number of victims is impossible to imagine,\" he added.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Moscow.\n\nFootage on social media from Kremenchuk's Amstor mall, close to the city centre, showed emergency services struggling to contain a huge fire on Monday afternoon.\n\nIn a Telegram video posted from the scene with rescue workers uncovering rubble behind him, Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, said \"the roof collapsed from the impact of a huge cruise missile\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009there may be many wounded under the ruins\".\n\nUkrainian officials late on Monday said at least 11 fatalities had so far been confirmed and 40 civilians wounded in the strike.\n\nThe latest missile attack, hundreds of kilometres from the battles in Ukraine's east, is the latest indication that Moscow is prepared to step up hostilities despite growing international efforts to isolate the Russian economy following its invasion.\n\nUkrainian officials claim Russian president Vladimir Putin's armed forces have fired more than 1,400 missiles at infrastructure, civilian and military targets since they launched a full-blown invasion of the country just over four months ago.\n\nDozens of strikes have rocked Ukrainian cities in recent days, including areas far from frontline battles, just as leaders of G7 countries started their summit in the German Alps. One missile hit a residential building and kindergarten in Kyiv early on Sunday morning, killing at least one person and injuring a child.\n\nZelenskyy said in the post that the shopping mall posed \"no danger to the Russian army.

It is useless to hope for adequacy and humanity on her part.\"\n\nRussian missile strikes in past months have hit the Kremenchuk refinery, Ukraine's largest oil processing plant -- about 15km from the Amstor mall -- as well as fuel depots across the country, causing nationwide fuel shortages.\n\nAntony Blinken, US secretary of state, said: \"The world is horrified by Russia's missile strike today, which hit a crowded Ukrainian shopping mall -- the latest in a string of atrocities.\n\n\"We will continue to support our Ukrainian partners and hold Russia, including those responsible for atrocities, to account,\" he added in a tweet.\n\nUK prime minister Boris Johnson condemned the attack on the Kremenchuk mall in Ukraine, saying it was illustrative of Putin's \"cruelty\".\n\n\"This appalling attack has shown once again the depths of cruelty and barbarism to which the Russian leader will sink,\" he said.\n\n\"Once again our thoughts are with the families of innocent victims in Ukraine.

More than 30 people are missing, authorities say.\n\nUkraine's Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova, who is leading investigations into possible war crimes, visited the scene and said the bombing of the \"civilian infrastructure\" raised \"a question of crimes against humanity\".\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday called for Russia to be designated a \"state sponsor of terrorism\". On Monday he called Russia the world's \"largest terrorist organisation\" in the wake of the deadly bombing. More than 1,000 people were inside when two Russian missiles slammed into the building, he said.\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies, at a summit in Germany, said the attack was \"abominable\".\n\n\"Indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.

It left out key details on how the fossil fuel price caps would work in practice.\n\n\"Russia cannot and must not win and therefore our support for Ukraine and our sanctions against Russia will continue as long as necessary and with the necessary intensity in the coming weeks and months,\" French President Emmanuel Macron told a news conference after the G7 summit.\n\nG7 leaders head from Bavaria to Madrid on Tuesday for a NATO summit that will be dominated by Russia's war on Ukraine. On Monday Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg outlined plans for a massive increase in rapid reaction troops on NATO's eastern flank, rising from the current 40,000 to 300,000.\n\nRussia's defence ministry claimed on Tuesday that \"high precision\" missiles had struck warehouses stocking Western-supplied weapons, and that explosions had set fire to a nearby, disused shopping centre that it said was \"closed\".\n\nA barrister who is working with the Ukrainian prosecutor's office to investigate possible war crimes, refuted claims that a military object was located nearby.\n\nIn an earlier, initial Russian government comment on the Kremenchuk missile strike, UN representative Dmitry Polyanskiy alleged multiple inconsistencies that he didn't specify, claiming on Twitter that the incident was a \"provocation\" by Ukraine. He later retweeted a post from another official Russian organisation appearing to hint the attack had been staged.\n\nRussia has systematically denied it targets civilian infrastructure, even though Russian attacks have hit other shopping centres, theatres, hospitals, kindergartens and apartment buildings -- killing and injuring thousands of people.\n\nThe attack on Kremenchuk was one of several launched by Moscow's forces across Ukraine to have hit civilians since the weekend:\n\nUkraine's air force command said the shopping centre in Kremenchuk was hit by two long-range X-22 missiles fired from Tu-22M3 bombers that flew from Shaykovka airfield in Russia's Kaluga region. Officials said a sports arena in the city was also hit.\n\nRussia has increasingly used long-range bombers in the war. The strike on Kremenchuk echoed earlier attacks that caused large numbers of civilian casualties -- such as one in March on a Mariupol theatre where many civilians had holed up, killing an estimated 600, and another in April on a train station in eastern Kramatorsk that left at least 59 people dead.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DMKX0aVAHuUb0zwpXDuiNw--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/euronews_uk_articles_973/9dd037e40ea8760d19b8743de0d6aaa9", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 14, "stanza_neu": 21, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 38, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094039656", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "21:27:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T21:27:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T21:11:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7019608020782471, "url": "https://usanews-24.com/at-least-13-people-were-killed-in-a-rocket-attack-on-a-crowded-ukrainian-shopping-center", "title": "At least 13 people were killed in a rocket attack on a crowded Ukrainian shopping center - USA News 24", "body": "Kyiv: A Russian rocket attack on a crowded shopping mall in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk killed at least 13 people on Monday, the regional governor said, updating an earlier number of tolls.\n\n\"Today's Russian attack on a shopping center in Kremenchuk is one of the most brazen terrorist acts in European history,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening broadcast on the Telegram.\n\nDmytro Lunin, the governor of the Poltava region where Kremenchuk is located, said the death toll had risen from 10 to at least 13, and more than 40 people had been injured.\n\nEarlier, Zelensky said \"more than a thousand civilians\" were in the mall when the missiles hit a city where 220,000 people lived before the war.\n\n\"The mall is on fire, rescuers are fighting the fire.

He gave no details of casualties but said: \"It is impossible to even imagine the number of victims.\n\nMinutes later, Zelensky's deputy chief of staff, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said on Telegram that there were around 20 wounded so far, with nine in \"serious condition\".\n\n\"Two people died.

And, you know, it is heartbreaking to see what we see here and to hear the stories,\" Sandu said in Bucha outside Kyiv, calling for anyone found guilty of atrocities to be punished.\n\nSandu said Moldova, a former Soviet republic of 2.6 million people that borders Ukraine, wanted to determine its own future.\n\n\"Moldova is a fragile and vulnerable country,\" she said. \"Ukraine and Moldova need help. We want this war to stop, this Russian aggression against Ukraine to be stopped as soon as possible. We want to stay part of the free world.\"\n\n>> Transnistria: Moldova's breakaway region in the shadow of war in Ukraine\n\nSandu also visited the towns of Borodyanka and Irpin, and later began talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nAfrican countries are facing a food-supply 'emergency' and need 'immediate funding' amid the war in Ukraine, said Edwin Ikhuoria, the Africa Executive Director of the ONE campaign, speaking to FRANCE 24 amid the G7 summit in southern Germany.\n\nIkhuoria said African countries were already experiencing a food-security crisis before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but a Russian forces' blockade in the Black Sea, which has halted the export of thousands of tonnes of Ukrainian grain, has made the situation worse.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday asked G7 leaders to further squeeze Russia over its invasion of Ukraine by capping prices of oil exported by Moscow.\n\n\"For us, a consistent position of the G7 countries on sanctions is important. They must be further strengthened, by limiting the prices of oil exported by the aggressor,\" Zelensky wrote on his Telegram account after addressing the G7 summit in Germany via videolink.\n\nA senior US official told reporters Monday that negotiations were advancing on how to cap the amount of money that Russia can get for key oil exports.\n\nThe US and Canada, which are far less reliant on Russia as an energy supplier than Europe, have banned all Russian oil imports.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky told G7 leaders on Monday that the time has not yet come to open negotiations with Russia, as Kyiv is still seeking to consolidate its positions, the French presidency said Monday.\n\n\"President Zelensky gave a very clear response that now is not the time for negotiations. Ukraine will negotiate when it is in a position to do so, that is, when it has basically re-established a position of strength,\" the French presidency said after the Ukrainian leader joined the G7 summit via videolink.\n\nSpeaking ahead of a NATO summit on Wednesday, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia poses \"most significant and direct threat to our security\". At the summit, Stoltenberg said allies \"will agree a strengthened comprehensive assistance package for Ukraine\", including secure communications systems and anti-drone systems.\n\n\"All of this is making a difference on the battlefield every day,\" the NATO chief said.\n\nIn the longer term, \"we will help Ukraine transition from Soviet-era military equipment to modern NATO equipment\".\n\nStoltenberg also said NATO allies will boost their high-readiness forces from the current 40,000 to \"well over 300,000\" as they strengthen their defences in response to Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies on Monday pledged to stand with Ukraine \"for as long as it takes\" by cranking up sanctions on Russia and backing security commitments for Kyiv in a post-war settlement.\n\n\"We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,\" it said in a statement, which also contained ways the G7 could do so, as well as a list of demands on Russia.\n\nIt said that Moscow must \"immediately\" return Ukrainians who have been taken by force, and that Russia must allow grain shipments to leave Ukraine to avoid exacerbating a global food crisis.\n\nThe group also expressed \"serious concern\" over Russia's plans to deliver missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads to Belarus in the coming months. \"We urge Russia to behave responsibly and exercise restraint,\" the leaders of the world's top industrialised nations said in a statement.\n\nRussia sanctioned 43 more Canadian citizens on Monday, barring them from entering the country in a tit-for-tat response to Western sanctions on Moscow.\n\nThe list, published by the foreign ministry, included the chairperson of Canada's governing Liberal Party, Suzanne Cowan, and the former governor of the Bank of England and Bank of Canada, Mark Carney.\n\nIn April, Moscow sanctioned 61 Canadian officials and journalists. It has barred dozens of other Western politicians, journalists, celebrities and business figures from entering Russia.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday asked for anti-aircraft defence systems, more sanctions on Russia and security guarantees as he addressed leaders of the Group of Seven summit, a European official said.\n\nZelensky told the leaders that they needed to do their utmost to end Russia's invasion of his country before the end of the year, saying winter battle conditions would make it tougher for his troops to fight back. A war pushing past winter also risked raging further beyond, he warned.\n\nAddressing the summit in the Bavarian Alps via video link, Zelensky also asked for help to export grain from Ukraine and for reconstruction aid, the European official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nRegional authorities urged civilians on Monday to leave the eastern Ukrainian city of Lysychansk which is being attacked by Russian forces.\n\n\"The situation in the city is very difficult,\" Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of the Luhansk region which includes Lysychansk, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nG7 leaders have agreed that money collected from higher trade tariffs imposed on Russian exports should be funnelled as aid to Ukraine, the White House said Monday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and other G7 leaders \"will seek authority to use revenues collected by any new tariffs on Russian goods to help Ukraine and to ensure that Russia pays for the cost of its war,\" a senior US official said.\n\nRussia looked set for its first sovereign default in decades as some bondholders said they had not received overdue interest on Monday following the expiry of a key payment deadline a day earlier.\n\nRussia has struggled to keep up payments on $40 billion of outstanding bonds since its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, as sweeping sanctions have effectively cut the country off from the global financial system and rendered its assets untouchable to many investors.\n\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly said there are no grounds for Russia to default but it is unable to send money to bondholders because of sanctions, accusing the West of trying to drive it into an artificial default. If a default is confirmed, it would be the first time Russia defaults since the Bolshevik revolution in 1917.\n\nRussian forces were fighting on Monday to capture Lysychansk, the last major city still held by Ukrainian troops in eastern Luhansk province, after Moscow-backed separatists said they were advancing on multiple fronts. Lysychansk's twin city, Severodonetsk, fell to to pro-Russian forces on Saturday.\n\nFRANCE 24's Luke Shrago reports on the developments from Ukraine:\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky will urge world powers to step up their support for Ukraine when he addresses the G7 summit on Monday, as Kyiv reels from the first Russian strikes on the capital in weeks.\n\nZelensky is set to join the leaders of the United States, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Japan and Canada via video link at 10:00am (0800 GMT).\n\n\"We need a powerful air defence - modern, fully effective.

Giant plumes of black smoke, dust and orange flames billowed from the wreckage as emergency crews combed through broken metal and concrete for victims. Drones whirred above, clouds of dark smoke still emanating from the ruins several hours after the fire was extinguished.\n\nCasualty figures rose as rescuers sifted through the smoldering rubble. The regional governor, Dmytro Lunin, said at least 18 people were killed and 59 others sought medical assistance, of whom 25 were hospitalized. The region declared a day of mourning Tuesday for the victims of the attack.\n\n\"We are working to dismantle the construction so that it is possible to get machinery in there since the metal elements are very heavy and big, and disassembling them by hand is impossible,\" said Volodymyr Hychkan, an emergency services official.\n\nUkraine's Prosecutor General, Iryna Venediktova, who is leading investigations into possible war crimes, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity,\" noting that the Russian military has been \"systematically shelling civilian infrastructure with the aim to scare people, to kill people, to bring terror to our cities and villages.\"\n\nVenediktova emphasized the need for Ukrainians across the entire country to remain alert, adding that they should expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nWayne Jordash, a British barrister who is working with Venediktova's office to investigate possible war crimes, rejected claims that a factory located near the shopping mall was a military object.\n\n\"The first indications are that the factory that got hit is a road construction factory, not a military target,\" Jordash said. \"We need to investigate whether there's military targets nearby, and the first indications as I say is that there aren't any military targets nearby.\"\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the attack.\n\nIn the first Russian government comment on the missile strike, the country's first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, Dmitry Polyansky, alleged multiple inconsistencies that he didn't specify, claiming on Twitter that the incident was a provocation by Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied it targets civilian infrastructure, even though Russian attacks have hit other shopping malls, theaters, hospitals, kindergartens and apartment buildings in the four-month war.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv in the Mykolaiv region, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. A further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to local officials.\n\nThe missile strike on Kremenchuk occurred as Western leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and the world's major economies prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nG-7 leaders condemned the attack in a statement late Monday saying \"indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime,\" noting that \"Russian President Putin and those responsible will be held to account.\"\n\nThe Russian strike echoed earlier attacks that caused large numbers of civilian casualties -- such as one in March on a Mariupol theater where many civilians had holed up, killing an estimated 600, and another in April on a train station in eastern Kramatorsk that killed at least 59 people.\n\nZelenskyy said the mall presented \"no threat to the Russian army\" and had \"no strategic value.\" He accused Russia of sabotaging \"people's attempts to live a normal life, which make the occupiers so angry.\"\n\nIn his nightly address, he said that Russian forces had intentionally targeted the shopping center in \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history,\" denouncing Russia as \"the largest terrorist organization in the world.\"\n\nRussia has increasingly used long-range bombers in the war. Ukrainian officials said Russian Tu-22M3 long-range bombers flying over Russia's western Kursk region fired the missiles, one of which hit the shopping center and another that struck a sports arena in Kremenchuk.\n\nThe U.S. appeared ready to respond to Zelenskyy's call for more air defense systems, and NATO planned to increase the size of its rapid-reaction forces nearly eightfold -- to 300,000 troops.\n\nThe attack on Kremenchuk coincided with Russia's all-out assault on the last Ukrainian stronghold in eastern Ukraine's Luhansk province, \"pouring fire\" on the city of Lysychansk from the ground and air, according to the local governor. At least eight people were killed and more than 20 wounded in Lysychansk when Russian rockets hit an area where a crowd gathered to obtain water from a tank, Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said.\n\nThe barrage was part of Russian forces' intensified offensive aimed at wresting the eastern Donbas region from Ukraine. Over the weekend, the Russian military and their local separatist allies forced Ukrainian government troops out of Lysychansk's neighboring city, Sievierodonetsk.\n\nTo the west of Lysychansk on Monday, the mayor of the city of Sloviansk -- potentially the next major battleground -- said Russian forces fired cluster munitions, including one that hit a residential neighborhood. Authorities said the number of victims had yet to be confirmed. The Associated Press saw one fatality: A man's body lay hunched over a car door frame, his blood pooling onto the ground from chest and head wounds. The blast blew out most windows in the surrounding apartment blocks and the cars parked below, littering the ground with broken glass.\n\n\"Everything is now destroyed,\" said resident Valentina Vitkovska, in tears as she spoke about the blast. \"We are the only people left living in this part of the building.

Video / The Kyiv Independent\n\nFrance's president denounced Russia's fiery airstrike on a crowded shopping mall in Ukraine as a \"new war crime\" on Tuesday (Wednesday NZ time) and vowed the West's support for Kyiv would not waver, saying Moscow \"cannot and should not win\" the war.\n\nThe strike, which killed at least 18 people in the central city of Kremenchuk, came as leaders from the Group of Seven nations met in Europe. It was part of an unusually intense barrage of Russian fire across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv, that renewed international attention as the war drags on.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G7 summit in Germany, French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven leading industrialised democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\"\n\n\"Russia cannot and should not win,\" he said. He called Monday's attack on the mall \"a new war crime\".\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian officials claimed the shopping centre was not the target.\n\nIn a virtual address to the UN Security Council, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being a \"terrorist\" and called for Russia to be expelled from the United Nations. He also urged the UN to establish an international tribunal to investigate Russia's action in Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy ended his address by asking all in the chamber to stand in silent tribute to the \"tens of thousands\" of Ukrainian children and adults killed in the war. All council members rose, including Russia's deputy UN ambassador Dmitry Polyansky.\n\nHow to counter Russia and back Ukraine will also be the focus of a summit this week of the Nato alliance, whose support has been critical to Kyiv's ability to fend off Moscow's larger and better-equipped forces. Ukrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to hold off and even drive back Russia, which is pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.\n\nAs Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall, which officials said was struck when more than 1000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when an explosion knocked her down. When another blast came about 10 minutes later, she realised she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicentre with all of my strength,\" she said. Fighting back tears, she added: \"You have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said. Several of the bodies of those who didn't make it out in time were burned beyond recognition, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded, and 21 people were still missing.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theatre, a train station, and a hospital. Zelenskyy called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history\".\n\nRocket attacks continued elsewhere in Ukraine. Authorities in the city of Dnipro said workers at a diesel car repair shop were trapped in rubble after a strike from a cruise missile fired from the Black Sea, Ukrainian news agencies reported. The Ukrainian military managed to intercept and destroy other missiles fired at the city, the agencies said.\n\nAs condemnation came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfilled its goals. He said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognising its control over the territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian Defence Ministry spokesman Lt Gen Igor Konashenkov claimed warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire. Ukrainian authorities said that in addition to the direct hit on the mall, a factory was struck, but denied it housed weapons.\n\nKonashenkov also falsely alleged the mall was not in use.\n\nOne survivor, Oleksandr, a mall employee, told the AP from a hospital bed the shopping centre was packed with customers. He recalled stepping outside with a colleague for a cigarette when the air raid siren went off.\n\n\"There was a black tunnel, smoke, fire,\" he said. \"I started to crawl. I saw the sun up there, and my brain was telling me I needed to save myself.\"\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity\". She emphasised the need for all Ukrainians to remain alert and expect a similar strike \"every minute\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. Six more people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire came as the G7 leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defence systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. Nato's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of a summit starting this week in Madrid, and an early signal of unity came on Tuesday when Turkey agreed to lift its opposition to Sweden and Finland joining Nato.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine prompted the two Nordic countries to abandon their long-held nonaligned status and apply to join Nato. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had blocked the move, insisting they change their stance on Kurdish rebel groups that Turkey considers terrorists.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the West that \"the more weapons are pumped into Ukraine, the longer the conflict will continue and the longer the agony of the Nazi regime backed by Western capitals will last\".\n\nRussia has falsely called the war a campaign to \"de-Nazify\" Ukraine -- a country with a democratically elected Jewish president who wants closer ties with the West.\n\nIn a sinister message to Nato leaders, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where their summit will be held.\n\nIt also posted images and the coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin -- referring to them as \"decision-making centres supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app. That wording echoes Putin's warnings he could target such centres in response to what he has called Western aggression.\n\nIn other developments, the two fighting countries continued a sporadic series of prisoner exchanges. Ukraine exchanged 15 Russian prisoners of war for 16 Ukrainian soldiers and one civilian, the Ukrainian Pravda news outlet reported on Tuesday.\n\nUkrainian Pravda also reported that in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, the mayor was detained Tuesday and occupying authorities seized his computer hard drive and documents after he had refused to cooperate with Russian-appointed local officials. Russia's Tass news agency confirmed the detention.\n\nMeanwhile, Bulgaria said on Tuesday it was expelling 70 Russian diplomats designated \"a threat to national security,\" ordering them to leave within five days. A Bulgarian foreign ministry statement said this would reduce Russia's Sofia embassy staff \"to up to 23 diplomatic and 25 administrative and technical staff.\"", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/iRudu905GExyBWVWTA1oIKN5kco=/1200x675/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/IU5WINMLEPLU7JC5Q6CVLC2HR4.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 16, "stanza_neu": 43, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 60, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094207988", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "02:09:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T02:09:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T02:07:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "url": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1697069", "title": "Missile strike on crowded mall kills 10 in Ukraine", "body": "KYIV: A Russian missile strike on a crowded mall in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk killed at least 10 people and injured more than 40 on Monday, a regional governor said.\n\n\"Ten dead and more than 40 people have been injured.

Russian President [Vladimir] Putin and those responsible will be held to account,\" the statement said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is hosting the G7 summit, reaffirmed the \"unwavering support\" of the group of rich nations for Ukraine earlier in the day.\n\nThe governor of the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said that a Russian strike on Monday in the city of Lysychansk killed eight civilians who were out collecting water.\n\n\"Today in Lysychansk, the Russians fired on a crowd of people with Uragan multiple rocket-launchers, as civilians were collecting water from a cistern,\" Haidai posted in Telegram.\n\n\"Eight residents are dead, 21 have been taken to hospital.\"\n\nLysychansk has become the most recent target of Russia's push in eastern Ukraine after capturing the nearby town of Sievierodonetsk over the weekend.\n\nGreece's foreign ministry said that there was \"no basis for the decision of the Russian authorities\" to expel eight Greek diplomats from Russia.\n\nThe move from Moscow comes after Athens kicked 12 Russian diplomats out of Greece at the beginning of April, marking the lowest point between the two countries since the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nGreece has joined in imposing sanctions on Russia as well as sending weapons to Ukraine.\n\nThe death toll in the Kremenchuk mall missile strike has risen to 10 according to the regional governor, with dozens more injured.\n\n\"Ten dead and more than 40 people have been injured. This is currently the situation in Kremenchuk as a result of the missile strike,\" Poltava oblast governor Dmytro Lunin said, warning that the toll could rise further.\n\nThe UN meanwhile has slammed the attack. \"It is deplorable, to say the least. Any sort of civilian infrastructure, which includes obviously shopping malls, and civilians should never be targeted,\" UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed his outrage in a tweet. \"The world is horrified by Russia's missile strike today, which hit a crowded Ukrainian shopping mall,\" Blink said. \"We will continue to support our Ukrainian partners and hold Russia, including those responsible for atrocities, to account.\"\n\nThe regional governor of Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine said that shelling had killed four people and wounded another 19.\n\n\"Doctors are providing all the necessary assistance. Information on the number of victims is being updated,\" Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region posed on Telegram.\n\nKharkiv is Ukraine's second-largest city and officials believe attacks targeting the city are an attempt to lure forces away from the Donbas region.\n\nA Russian missile strike on a crowded mall in eastern Ukraine has left at least two people dead and dozens injured according to local officials.\n\nThe Ukraine president's deputy chief of staff Kyrylo Tymoshenko said on Telegram: \"Two people died. The rescue operation continues.\"\n\nTymoshenko said that of the wounded, nine were in \"serious condition.\"\n\nVideo footage shared on social media showed flames and smoke billowing out of the shopping mall.\n\n\"The missile attack on the shopping center with people in Kremenchuk is another war crime by the Russians,\" Poltava oblast governor Dmytro Lunin said.\n\nRussian forces have struck a civilian building in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nDmitry Lunin, who oversees the Poltava region, confirmed that there have been an attack but could provide no further details.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there are victims. More details later,\" Lunin said.\n\nThe city's mayor Vitaliy Meletskiy said on Facebook that there had been a missile strike on a \"very crowded\" area in the city.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted a video on Facebook showing a building engulfed in flames and said: \"The invaders hit the mall with rockets, where there were more than a thousand civilians.\"\n\nZelenskyy said \"the number of victims cannot be imagined.\"\n\nA Russian hacking group has claimed responsibility for a cyber attack on Lithuania, according to Reuters news agency.\n\nKillnet said the DDOS attack on Lithuania was in response to Vilnius's move to block the movement of goods to Kaliningrad.\n\n\"The attack will continue until Lithuania lifts the blockade,\" a spokesman for the group told Reuters.\n\n\"We have demolished 1652 web resources. And that's just so far.\"\n\nRussian officials threatened to retaliate last week, with foreign ministry spokesperson saying Moscow had the right to defend its national interests if freight traffic was not restored.\n\nKaliningrad is Russia's westernmost region, or oblast. It is an exclave, meaning it shares no borders with mainland Russia.\n\nMoldova's president Maia Sandu said during a visit to Ukraine that her country was \"fragile and vulnerable\" and needed help to remain \"part of the free world\".\n\nFour days after European Union leaders decided to accept Ukraine and Moldova as membership candidates, President Sandu visited three towns where Ukraine suspects Russian forces of having committed atrocities against civilians.\n\n\"This shouldn't happen. And, you know, it is heartbreaking to see what we see here and to hear the stories,\" she said in the town of Bucha, outside Kyiv, calling for anyone found guilty of atrocities to be punished.\n\nSandu also visited the towns of Borodyanka and Irpin, and later began talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nEU leaders accepted Ukraine and Moldova as membership candidates at a summit in Brussels last week, putting both countries on what is likely to be a long road to membership.\n\nRussia equated the decision to \"enslaving\" its neighboring countries.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg says the alliance plans to massively increase the number of high readiness troops to over 300,000.\n\nNATO's quick reaction force currently has 40,000 troops.\n\nStoltenberg, who is attending a NATO summit in Madrid later this week, also said he expected the alliance to change its language on Russia in a new strategic concept to be agreed at the gathering.\n\n\"I expect that allies will state clearly that Russia poses a direct threat to our security, to our values, to the rules-based international order,\" he told a press conference.\n\nStoltenberg described the changes to the rapid response force and other responses to Russian threats as \"the biggest overhaul of our collective defense and deterrence since the Cold War.\"\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies have pledged enduring support Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression.\n\nIn a statement from their summit taking place in southern Germany, the G7 countries said they would \"continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.\"\n\nThe group voiced \"serious concern\" over Russia's plans to deliver missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads to Belarus.\n\n\"We urge Russia to behave responsibly and exercise restraint,\" the statement said.\n\nG7 leaders also called on Moscow to allow grain shipments to leave Ukraine and to \"cease, without condition, its attacks on agricultural and transport infrastructure.\"\n\nThe US is reportedly planning to send anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine to defend against Russian attacks.\n\nA source cited by news agencies said US President Joe Biden \"has made the procurement of advanced air defense systems for Ukraine a priority.\"\n\nThe source said an announcement on the purchase of NASAMS, a Norwegian-developed \"advanced medium- to long-range surface-to-air missile defense system,\" was \"likely this week.\"\n\nOther material, such as \"additional artillery ammunition and counter-battery radars,\" was also part of the arrangement, the source was quoted as saying.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed to world leaders at a G7 summit on Monday to step up support for Kyiv and intensify sanctions against Russia to help end the war.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has indicated that he is open to taking part in the G20 summit later this year, even if Russian President Vladimir Putin also attends.\n\nIn an interview with German public broadcaster ZDF, Scholz said the West has no intention to \"torpedo'' the group of 20 major economies that also includes Russia.\n\nThe G20 summit is due to take place in Indonesia in November.\n\nThe German chancellor said cooperation was important and that the group of major developed and developing economies will continue to play a \"big role.\"\n\n\"We must not walk into the trap Putin sets of asserting that the world is divided into the global West... and all the rest. That's not true. There are democracies all over the world and they have very similar perspectives,'' he said.\n\nScholz, who is hosting this week's G7 summit in Bavaria, said he would make a final decision about whether to attend the gathering \"shortly before departure.\"\n\nHe told leaders on Monday that the G7 \"will continue to increase pressure on Putin\" over his invasion of Ukraine, adding that \"this war has to come to an end.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appealed to world leaders attending a G7 summit to do everything they can to end Russia's invasion of his country before winter sets in, according to diplomats.\n\nZelenskyy delivered a closed-door address via video link on the second day of the G7 gathering taking place in the German Alps.\n\nDiplomatic sources cited by news agencies said he urged leaders to intensify sanctions against Moscow and boost reconstruction aid for Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy also asked for anti-aircraft defense systems and security guarantees, according to a European official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nRegional authorities have urged civilians to leave the eastern Ukrainian city of Lysychansk, which is under attack from Russian forces.\n\n\"Due to the real threat to life and health, we call on you to evacuate urgently,\" Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai wrote on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nHe said the situation there was \"very difficult.\" It is not clear how many of Lysychansk's 100,000 inhabitants remain in the city.\n\nGaidai said earlier on Monday that Lysychansk was suffering \"catastrophic\" damage from Russian shelling following the fall of neighboring Sievierodonetsk over the weekend.\n\nThe G7 leaders are planning to announce an agreement to pursue a price cap on Russian oil, according to a US official cited by news agencies.\n\nThe cap is part of a new package of measures designed to increase pressure on Moscow, including raising tariffs on Russian goods and imposing new sanctions on hundreds of Russian officials and entities.\n\n\"The dual objectives of G7 leaders have been to take direct aim at (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's revenues, particularly through energy, but also to minimize the spillovers and the impact on the G7 economies and the rest of the world,\" the US official said on the sidelines of the annual G7 summit currently taking place in Germany.\n\nThe details of how a price cap would work were to be resolved by G7 finance ministers in the coming weeks and months, the official said.\n\nThe leaders of Finland and Sweden are expected to discuss their plans to join NATO with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday.\n\nA statement from the Finnish presidency said the meeting at the start of an alliance summit in Madrid would also include NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg.\n\nThe statement said the discussions \"will be preceded today by a round of talks between Finnish, Swedish and Turkish officials hosted by NATO in Brussels.\"\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine prompted the two Nordic countries to abandon their long-held policy of neutrality and apply to join NATO. But their membership bids have stalled due to opposition from Turkey.\n\nAnkara accuses Finland and Sweden of sheltering Kurdish terrorist groups banned in Turkey. Both countries deny the charge.\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine is set to dominate the second day of a three-day G7 summit in Germany's Alps.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to address the meeting via video link.\n\nThe leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US arrived at the Schloss Elmau resort in Bavaria on Sunday. On the first day of the summit, they announced a ban on imports of Russian gold over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe AP news agency reported that the US was preparing to unveil the purchase of an advanced surface-to-air missile system for Kyiv during Monday's session.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was also expected to join the meeting to discuss the food crisis triggered by the war.\n\nThe new commander of the German military's Operations Command, Bernd Sch\u00fctt, says the biggest danger of an escalation with Russia lies on NATO's northeastern flank.\n\n\"And that's why the point of credible deterrence in this region is a very central point for me,\" the lieutenant general told Germany's dpa news agency. \"This is where the presence of land forces plays a central role.\"\n\nSch\u00fctt said there was a need for the Bundeswehr to \"adapt existing structures and procedures,\" with more drills for national and alliance defense planned for his command.\n\n\"We have not yet trained this kind of intensive warfare here,\" he added.\n\nFears of an escalation have been growing in the Baltic region amid a dispute over the shipment of Russian goods through NATO member Lithuania to Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad.\n\n\"In the area of the Suwalki Gap, it is only a short jump and the risk of testing NATO's defense will and capability is relatively high,\" said Sch\u00fctte, referring to the strategically important corridor that separates Kaliningrad from Belarus and connects the Baltic states to the other NATO members.\n\n\"In that space, you can move troops relatively quickly and then make a first strike, for example, using airborne troops,\" he said, adding that it was crucial to reinforce NATO forces in the region.\n\nRussia is set to default on its foreign debt for the first time since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.\n\nMoscow has been unable to pay the $40 billion (\u20ac38 billion) in foreign bonds it owes as a result of sweeping sanctions imposed over its war in Ukraine. The measures effectively excluded Russia from the global financial system and froze billions in foreign currency held overseas.\n\nA 30-day grace period on $100 million in interest payments originally due on May 27 expired on Sunday. But it could be some time before a Russian default is confirmed. A default declaration would usually come from rating agencies or be decided by a court.\n\nThe Kremlin says any default is artificial because it has the funds to pay bondholders but is blocked from doing so by the sanctions.\n\nThe US Treasury Department last month ended Russia's ability to pay its billions in debt to international investors through American banks. Russia's Finance Ministry then said it would pay dollar-denominated debts in rubles.\n\nSix people have been injured in a missile strike in the southern Ukrainian region of Odesa, according to Ukraine's military.\n\n\"The strike in a residential area of civilian settlement destroyed several residential and farm buildings over around 500 square meters,\" the southern military command said.\n\nIt added that the missile was fired from a Russian type Tu-22 strategic bomber.\n\nRegional administration spokesperson Serhiy Bratchuk said that one of the wounded individuals was a child.\n\nThe information could not be independently verified. Russia denies targeting civilians.\n\nOver the weekend, Ukraine reported a spike in Russian missile attacks on regions far behind the front line, including Lviv and Kyiv.\n\nIn his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on the people of neighboring Belarus not to be drawn into Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine.\n\n\"The Kremlin has already decided everything for you. But you are not slaves and cannon fodder. You don't have to die,\" he said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin announced Saturday that Moscow intends to supply nuclear-capable Iskander-M missile systems to Belarus in the coming months.\n\n\"I know that the people of Belarus support Ukraine, they support us, definitely us, not the war. And that is why the Russian leadership wants to draw you -- all Belarusians -- into the war, wants to sow hatred between us,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe called on ordinary Belarusians to refuse to participate in this war. \"Your lives belong only to you, not to someone in the Kremlin,\" the Ukrainian president added.\n\nZelenskyy also mentioned the numerous Russian rocket attacks on Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, and Ukraine's need for a modern air defense.\n\n\"Part of the missiles were shot down. But only part. We need a powerful air defense -- modern, fully effective. Which can ensure complete protection against these missiles,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian authorities talk about this every day with their partners. However, he warned that delays in arms transfers to Ukraine and any restrictions are actually an invitation for Russia to keep striking.\n\nThe war in Ukraine could allow illegal drug production to flourish, the United Nations warned on Monday.\n\nPrevious experience from the Middle East and Southeast Asia suggests conflict zones can act as a \"magnet\" for making synthetic drugs, which can be manufactured anywhere, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said in its annual report.\n\nThe UNODC said the number of dismantled amphetamine laboratories in Ukraine rose from 17 in 2019 to 79 in 2020, the highest number of seized laboratories reported in any country in 2020.\n\nUkraine's capacity to produce synthetic drugs could grow as the war continues, it added.\n\n\"You don't have police going around and stopping laboratories\" in conflict zones, UNODC expert Angela Me said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is planning to travel to Tajikistan and Turkmenistan in the coming days, although the exact dates of the journey remain unclear.\n\nPutin will first fly to Tajikistan, a military ally, for talks with President Emomali Rakhmon, Russian state television reported.\n\nPutin will then travel on to Turkmenistan to join a summit of the Caspian Sea states.\n\nThe meeting is planned for Wednesday, government spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, according to the TASS news agency.\n\nThis would be the first trip abroad for Putin since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.\n\nRussian Federation Council speaker Valentina Matvienko said that Russia is ready to negotiate only if Kyiv accepts Moscow's conditions.\n\nUS President Joe Biden told G7 leaders gathered in Germany that the West must remain unified in its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPro-Russian separatists said that around 250 more people were evacuated from the Azot chemical factory in Sievierodonetsk after Ukraine relinquished control of the city.\n\nUkrainian forces attacked an oil platform in the Black Sea, the Tass news agency reported, citing local officials.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said Russian forces struck three Ukrainian military training centers in northern and western Ukraine.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu visited Russian troops in Ukraine.\n\nBritain's Ministry of Defense said most Ukrainian forces had withdrawn from their remaining defensive positions in the city of Sievierodonetsk.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.dw.com/image/62279569_6.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 32, "stanza_neu": 132, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 166, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7095658826", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-29", "time": "04:09:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-29T04:09:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-29T04:09:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "url": "https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2022/jun/29/russia-can-not-and-should-not-win-ukraine-war-french-president-emmanuel-macron-2471020.html", "title": "Russia can not and should not win Ukraine war:  French President Emmanuel Macron", "body": "UKRAINE: French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday that \"Russia cannot and should not win the war in Ukraine,\" as its terrible toll was in full view the day after a Russian missile strike hit a shopping mall, killing 18 people.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the Group of Seven summit in Germany, Macron said the seven industrialised democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\n\nHis comments came as rescuers searched through the charred rubble of the shopping mall, looking for more victims of what Ukraine's president called one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy said more than 1,000-afternoon shoppers and workers were inside the mall in the city of Kremenchuk. Giant plumes of black smoke, dust and orange flames billowed from the wreckage as emergency crews combed through broken metal and concrete for victims.\n\nDrones whirred above, clouds of dark smoke still emanating from the ruins several hours after the fire was extinguished. Casualty figures rose as rescuers sifted through the smouldering rubble.\n\nThe regional governor, Dmytro Lunin, said at least 18 people were killed and 59 others sought medical assistance, of whom 25 were hospitalised. The region declared a day of mourning Tuesday for the victims of the attack.\n\n\"We are working to dismantle the construction so that it is possible to get machinery in there since the metal elements are very heavy and big, and disassembling them by hand is impossible,\" said Volodymyr Hychkan, an emergency services official.\n\nUkraine's Prosecutor General, Iryna Venediktova, who is leading investigations into possible war crimes, said the missile attack was one of Russia's crimes against humanity, noting that the Russian military has been systematically shelling civilian infrastructure with the aim to scare people, to kill people, to bring terror to our cities and villages.\n\nVenediktova emphasised the need for Ukrainians across the entire country to remain alert, adding that they should expect a similar strike \"every minute. Wayne Jordash, a British barrister who is working with Venediktova's office to investigate possible war crimes, rejected claims that a factory located near the shopping mall was a military object.\n\nThe first indications are that the factory that got hit is a road construction factory, not a military target,\" Jordash said. We need to investigate whether there are military targets nearby, and the first indication as I say is that there aren't any military targets nearby.\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the UN Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the attack. In the first Russian government comment on the missile strike, the country's first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, Dmitry Polyansky, alleged multiple inconsistencies that he didn't specify, claiming on Twitter that the incident was a provocation by Ukraine.\n\nRussia has repeatedly denied it targets civilian infrastructure, even though Russian attacks have hit other shopping malls, theatres, hospitals, kindergartens and apartment buildings in the four-month war. On Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv in the Mykolaiv region, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child.\n\nA further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to local officials. The missile strike on Kremenchuk occurred as Western leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and the world's major economies prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nG-7 leaders condemned the attack in a statement late Monday saying \"indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime,\" noting that \"Russian President Putin and those responsible will be held to account.\n\nThe Russian strike echoed earlier attacks that caused large numbers of civilian casualties such as one in March on a Mariupol theatre where many civilians had holed up, killing an estimated 600, and another in April on a train station in eastern Kramatorsk that killed at least 59 people.\n\nZelenskyy said the mall presented \"no threat to the Russian army and had no strategic value.\" He accused Russia of sabotaging people's attempts to live a normal life, which make the occupiers so angry.\n\nIn his nightly address, he said that Russian forces had intentionally targeted the shopping centre in \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history, denouncing Russia as the largest terrorist organisation in the world. Russia has increasingly used long-range bombers in the war.\n\nUkrainian officials said Russian Tu-22M3 long-range bombers flying over Russia's western Kursk region fired the missiles, one of which hit the shopping centre and another that struck a sports arena in Kremenchuk.\n\nThe US appeared ready to respond to Zelenskyy's call for more air defence systems, and NATO planned to increase the size of its rapid-reaction forces nearly eightfold to 300,000 troops.\n\nThe attack on Kremenchuk coincided with Russia's all-out assault on the last Ukrainian stronghold in eastern Ukraine's Luhansk province, pouring fire on the city of Lysychansk from the ground and air, according to the local governor. At least eight people were killed and more than 20 wounded in Lysychansk when Russian rockets hit an area where a crowd gathered to obtain water from a tank, Luhansk Gov Serhiy Haidai said.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2022/6/29/w600X390/ukraine_mall.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.4745098039215686, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 19, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 32, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094480320", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "07:46:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T07:46:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T07:46:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/06/27/at-least-18-killed-in-russian-missile-strike-on-ukrainian-shopping-mall-a78123", "title": "At Least 18 Killed in Russian Missile Strike on Ukrainian Shopping Mall", "body": "A Russian missile strike on a crowded mall in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk on Monday has killed at least 18 people, Ukrainian authorities said, amid global outrage toward the attack.\n\nVideo footage shows plumes of black smoke rising from the burning shopping center in the industrial city of Kremenchuk as dozens of rescuers rush around the perimeter and fire trucks parked nearby.\n\n\"The occupiers fired missiles at a shopping center where there were over a thousand civilians.

Serhiy Haidai said Russian forces were pummelling Lysychansk after capturing the neighbouring city of Sievierodonetsk in recent days.\n\nIt's part of a stepped-up Russian offensive to wrest the broader Donbas region from Ukrainian government control in what Western experts say has become the new main goal of President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine, now in its fifth month.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky said 1,000 civilians were in the crowded mall at the time of the strike, with scores feared dead\n\nThe shopping centre is engulfed in flames after the attack in broad daylight as plumes of black smoke rise from the building\n\nThe shopping centre is pictured before the brutal attack carried out by Putin's forces this afternoon\n\n'They're pouring fire on the city both from the air and from the ground. After the takeover of Sevierodonetsk, the enemy army has concentrated all its forces on capturing (our) last stronghold in the Luhansk region: Lysychansk,' Haidai told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Russians were trying to blockade the city from the south, 'destroying everything that their artillery and multiple rocket launchers can reach,' Haidai said.\n\nIn recent weeks, Russian troops have captured several villages and towns southeast of Lysychansk, and were trying to halt access to the city from the south.\n\nMeanwhile to the west, the mayor of the city of Sloviansk - potentially the next major battleground - said Russian forces fired cluster munitions on the city after dawn, including one that hit a residential neighbourhood.\n\nAuthorities say the number of dead and injured are still to be confirmed. The AP saw one fatality: A man's body lay hunched over a car door frame, his blood pooling onto the ground from scattered chest and head wounds.\n\nUkraine forces have spent weeks consolidating their defences around Sloviansk out of concern that it could be the next big Russian target if Lysychansk falls.\n\nLast week, Zelensky said Russia wanted to 'capture and completely destroy' Sloviansk.\n\nKremenchuk is an industrial hub in central Ukraine, situated on the banks of the Dnipro River\n\nZelensky said in a Telegram post that the number of victims was 'unimaginable,' citing reports that more than 1,000 civilians were inside at the time of the attack\n\nZelensky stressed that the target presented 'no threat to the Russian army' and had 'no strategic value'\n\nThe shockwave from Monday's blast blew out most windows in the surrounding apartment blocks and the cars parked below, littering the ground with broken glass.\n\n'Everything is now destroyed. We are the only people left living in this part of the building. There is no power,' said local resident Valentina Vitkovska, in tears as she spoke about the blast. 'I can't even call to tell others what had happened to us.'\n\nOverall, Zelenskyy office said at least six civilians were killed and 31 others injured as part of intense Russian shelling against various Ukrainian cities over the past 24 hours - including Kyiv and major cities in the country's south and east.\n\nIt said Russian forces fired rockets that killed two people and injured five overnight in and near Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, and continued to target the key southern port of Odesa.\n\nA missile attack destroyed residential buildings and injured six people, including a child, it said.\n\nIn Lysychansk, at least five high-rise buildings in the city and the last road bridge were damaged over the past day, Haidai, the governor, said.\n\nA crucial highway linking the city to government-held territory further south was rendered impassable because of shelling.\n\nSuch shelling is also making the evacuation of civilians increasingly difficult, Haidai said. The city had a pre-war population of around 100,000, approximately one-tenth of whom remain.\n\nAnalysts say that Lysychansk's location high on the banks of the Siverskiy Donets river, as well as its large area dotted with hills, give a major advantage to the city's Ukrainian defenders.\n\n'It's a very hard nut to crack. The Russians could spend many months and much effort storming Lysychansk,' said military analyst Oleh Zhdanov.\n\nThe Siverskiy Donets river encloses Lysychansk from the north and east, while the Ukrainian army continues to hold territory west of the city, which it uses to supply arms and humanitarian aid.\n\nThe news came after Ukraine's Ministry of Defence said Ukrainian troops had destroyed a Russian Pantsir anti-aircraft system in a series of strikes on the island on Sunday night.\n\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video Watch video Watch video Watch video Watch video Watch video Watch video Watch video Watch video Watch video Watch video Watch video\n\nUkraine's Ministry of Defence said Ukrainian troops had destroyed a Russian Pantsir anti-aircraft system in the strike\n\nSnake Island is seen in an aerial photo on June 17 before Ukraine carried out a series of strikes on the strategic outpost\n\nBy June 20, Ukraine had caused serious damage, with satellite imagery showing devastated regions\n\nUkraine's southern operational command aimed strikes on the island less than a week before, with satellite images showing the major losses to Kremlin troops.\n\nThe Russian Pantsir anti-aircraft system, a radar station and vehicles had been damaged in the June 20 attack on the island which has been a major battleground throughout the war.\n\nIt is just the latest blow for Putin, as it emerged that a column of Russian rocket launcher vehicles were blown to pieces in an ambush by Ukrainian special armed forces.\n\nFootage shows Ukrainian troops opening fire and destroying six BM-27 Uragans, a self-propelled multiple rocket launcher, as well as other Russian vehicles such as armoured personnel carriers.\n\nIn a further blow to Putin, an invading Russian tank was obliterated in a minefield.

With these summits, Western leaders are seeking to find new ways to counter Russia militarily and economically.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine is increasingly becoming a proxy war between the Kremlin and NATO, and one at only at risk of broadening as the West supplies advanced weapons, detailed battlefield intelligence and massive financial support to Kyiv.

Fighting back tears, she added: \"You have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nRelated Russian missile strike hits crowded shopping mall in Ukraine\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said. Several of the bodies of those who didn't make it out in time are burned beyond recognition, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded. Another 21 people are still missing, Monastyrsky said.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theater, a train station, and a hospital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRocket attacks continued elsewhere in Ukraine, with authorities in the city of Dnipro reporting that workers at a diesel car repair shop were trapped in rubble after a strike from a cruise missile fired from the Black Sea, Ukrainian news agencies reported. The Ukrainian military managed to intercept and destroy other missiles fired at the city, the agencies said.\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the Kremenchuk attack.\n\nAs condemnation came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals. He said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognizing its control over territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire. Ukrainian authorities said that in addition to the direct hit on the mall, a factory was struck, but denied it housed weapons.\n\nKonashenkov also alleged that the mall was not in use, a false claim that witnesses contradicted.\n\nOne survivor, Oleksandr, a mall employee, told the AP from a hospital bed that the shopping center was packed with customers. He recalled stepping outside with a colleague for a cigarette when the air raid siren went off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There was a black tunnel, smoke, fire,\" he said. \"I started to crawl. I saw the sun up there, and my brain was telling me I need to save myself.\"\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity.\" She emphasized the need for all Ukrainians to remain alert and expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. A further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire came as the G-7 leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of a summit starting this week in Madrid.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the West that \"the more weapons are pumped into Ukraine, the longer the conflict will continue and the longer the agony of the Nazi regime backed by Western capitals will last.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia has falsely called the war a campaign to \"de-Nazify\" Ukraine - a country with a democratically elected Jewish president who wants closer ties with the West.\n\nIn a sinister message to NATO leaders, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where their summit will be held.\n\nIt also posted images and the coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin -- referring to them as \"decision-making centers supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app. That wording echoes Russian President Vladimir Putin's warnings that he could target such centers in response to what he has called Western aggression.\n\nIn other developments, the two fighting countries continued a sporadic series of prisoner exchanges. Ukraine exchanged 15 Russian prisoners-of-war for 16 Ukrainian soldiers and one civilian, the Ukrainian Pravda news outlet reported Tuesday.\n\nUkrainian Pravda also reported that in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, the mayor was detained Tuesday and occupying authorities seized his computer hard drive and documents after he had refused to cooperate with Russian-appointed local officials. Russia's Tass news agency confirmed the detention.\n\nMeanwhile, Bulgaria said Tuesday it was expelling 70 Russian diplomats designated \"a threat to national security,\" ordering them to leave within 5 days.\n\nA Bulgarian foreign ministry statement said this would reduce Russia's Sofia embassy staff \"to up to 23 diplomatic and 25 administrative and technical staff.\"\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

Giant plumes of black smoke, dust and orange flames billowed from the wreckage as emergency crews combed through broken metal and concrete for victims. Drones whirred above, clouds of dark smoke still emanating from the ruins several hours after the fire was extinguished.\n\nCasualty figures rose as rescuers sifted through the smoldering rubble. The regional governor, Dmytro Lunin, said at least 18 people were killed and 59 others sought medical assistance, of whom 25 were hospitalized. The region declared a day of mourning Tuesday for the victims of the attack.\n\n\"We are working to dismantle the construction so that it is possible to get machinery in there since the metal elements are very heavy and big, and disassembling them by hand is impossible,\" said Volodymyr Hychkan, an emergency services official.\n\nUkraine's Prosecutor General, Iryna Venediktova, who is leading investigations into possible war crimes, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity,\" noting that the Russian military has been \"systematically shelling civilian infrastructure with the aim to scare people, to kill people, to bring terror to our cities and villages.\"\n\nVenediktova emphasized the need for Ukrainians across the entire country to remain alert, adding that they should expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nWayne Jordash, a British barrister who is working with Venediktova's office to investigate possible war crimes, rejected claims that a factory located near the shopping mall was a military object.\n\n\"The first indications are that the factory that got hit is a road construction factory, not a military target,\" Jordash said. \"We need to investigate whether there's military targets nearby, and the first indications as I say is that there aren't any military targets nearby.\"\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the attack.\n\nIn the first Russian government comment on the missile strike, the country's first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, Dmitry Polyansky, alleged multiple inconsistencies that he didn't specify, claiming on Twitter that the incident was a provocation by Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied it targets civilian infrastructure, even though Russian attacks have hit other shopping malls, theaters, hospitals, kindergartens and apartment buildings in the four-month war.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv in the Mykolaiv region, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. A further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to local officials.\n\nThe missile strike on Kremenchuk occurred as Western leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and the world's major economies prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nG-7 leaders condemned the attack in a statement late Monday saying \"indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime,\" noting that \"Russian President Putin and those responsible will be held to account.\"\n\nThe Russian strike echoed earlier attacks that caused large numbers of civilian casualties -- such as one in March on a Mariupol theater where many civilians had holed up, killing an estimated 600, and another in April on a train station in eastern Kramatorsk that killed at least 59 people.\n\nZelenskyy said the mall presented \"no threat to the Russian army\" and had \"no strategic value.\" He accused Russia of sabotaging \"people's attempts to live a normal life, which make the occupiers so angry.\"\n\nIn his nightly address, he said that Russian forces had intentionally targeted the shopping center in \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history,\" denouncing Russia as \"the largest terrorist organization in the world.\"\n\nRussia has increasingly used long-range bombers in the war. Ukrainian officials said Russian Tu-22M3 long-range bombers flying over Russia's western Kursk region fired the missiles, one of which hit the shopping center and another that struck a sports arena in Kremenchuk.\n\nThe U.S. appeared ready to respond to Zelenskyy's call for more air defense systems, and NATO planned to increase the size of its rapid-reaction forces nearly eightfold -- to 300,000 troops.\n\nThe attack on Kremenchuk coincided with Russia's all-out assault on the last Ukrainian stronghold in eastern Ukraine's Luhansk province, \"pouring fire\" on the city of Lysychansk from the ground and air, according to the local governor. At least eight people were killed and more than 20 wounded in Lysychansk when Russian rockets hit an area where a crowd gathered to obtain water from a tank, Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said.\n\nThe barrage was part of Russian forces' intensified offensive aimed at wresting the eastern Donbas region from Ukraine. Over the weekend, the Russian military and their local separatist allies forced Ukrainian government troops out of Lysychansk's neighboring city, Sievierodonetsk.\n\nTo the west of Lysychansk on Monday, the mayor of the city of Sloviansk -- potentially the next major battleground -- said Russian forces fired cluster munitions, including one that hit a residential neighborhood. Authorities said the number of victims had yet to be confirmed. The Associated Press saw one fatality: A man's body lay hunched over a car door frame, his blood pooling onto the ground from chest and head wounds. The blast blew out most windows in the surrounding apartment blocks and the cars parked below, littering the ground with broken glass.\n\n\"Everything is now destroyed,\" said resident Valentina Vitkovska, in tears as she spoke about the blast. \"We are the only people left living in this part of the building. There is no power. I can't even call to tell others what had happened to us.\"\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

According to the latest reports, 18 people were killed and at least 50 are injured in the Russian missile attack.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that more than 1,000 people were in the mall at the time the missiles struck, and that \"the number of victims is unimaginable.\" The head of state said that the strike had no strategic value for the Russian army, and that the aggressor country was simply continuing to take out its anger on civilians.\n\nRead also: Eighteen people killed as Russians launch missiles at packed shopping mall in Kremenchuk (UPDATED)\n\nThe Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine said that more than 40 reports of missing people at the shopping mall have been filed.

Authorities said the refinery would not resume operations until the end of the year.\n\nThe refinery is about 11 kilometers to the north of the Amstor shopping center.

Over the past three days, its missiles have hit several civilian sites lying hundreds of miles from Ukraine's main battlegrounds, including an apartment block in Kyiv.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, said that there were \"a thousand people\" inside the Amstor shopping mall in Kremenchuk when the missile struck in the middle of the afternoon.\n\n\"The mall is on fire, firefighters are trying to extinguish the fire, the number of victims is impossible to imagine,\" he said on his Telegram channel.\n\nVideos on Twitter showed flames and black smoke billowing out of the shopping mall and civilians helping overwhelmed emergency service crews load people into ambulances. A fire engine donated by Humberside Fire and Rescue doused flames.\n\nIn one video shot from inside the shopping mall, a man steps over broken glass and rubble to escape a smoke-filled room. For one moment, the camera pans across a small, motionless body.\n\nDmitry Lunin, the mayor of Kremenchuk, said that at least 16 people had been killed in the attack and 40 injured but that these totals were expected to climb.\n\n\"In Kremenchuk, a civilian target was hit and there are civilian deaths, unfortunately,\" he said.\n\nIn a joint statement, leaders of the G7 said Vladimir Putin's attacks aimed at civilians were a \"war crime\".\n\nThe statement said: \"We, the leaders of the G7, solemnly condemn the abominable attack on a shopping mall in Kremenchuk.

It is the base for a truck plant, an oil refinery, a railway carriage plant and a hydroelectric dam.\n\nRussian missiles have hit the oil refinery three times previously, destroying it. The most recent attack was in mid-June.\n\nBoris Johnson, who was attending the G7 summit in Bavaria which has been dominated by talks on how to support Ukraine, said that the attack should strengthen the West's resolve.\n\n\"This appalling attack has shown once again the depths of cruelty and barbarism to which the Russian leader will sink,\" he said.\n\nIn the past three days, Russia has fired missiles at what it has described as legitimate logistics targets in Ukraine. On Saturday it hit Ukrainian army training centres around Kyiv and on Sunday it fired cruise missiles at several other sites hundreds of miles from the Kharkiv and Donbas battlegrounds.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defence has said that it targets infrastructure with high-precision missiles but it has also destroyed an apartment block in central Kyiv for the first time since April. At least two people were killed in the attacks.\n\nMr Putin had promised to strike \"new targets\" after Britain and the US pledged to send new long-range missile systems to Ukraine earlier in June, but Russia has been accused of targeting civilians deliberately to undermine morale.\n\nIn the Donbas, Russian officials said that street battles were now being fought in and around Lysychansk after Russian soldiers completed their conquest of the neighbouring town of Severodonetsk over the weekend.\n\nLysychansk is the last town in the Luhansk region that is not under the control of Russian forces. The Luhansk region makes up half of Donbas, with Donetsk making up the second half.

The Russian invasion has stopped the flow of Ukrainian wheat, causing food shortages and price increases across the world.

See below for the latest updates.\n\nAs the Group of Seven meeting in Germany concludes on Tuesday, another big summit is beginning -- the meeting of the NATO alliance in Spain.\n\nThe summit is arguably the most important meeting of the alliance in recent months, with member countries and non-NATO allies, such as Australia and South Korea, set to discuss the war in Ukraine and how to confront an increasingly aggressive Russia.\n\nOn Monday, NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the Western military organization would increase the number of troops within its rapid response force -- which comprises land, air, sea and special forces units that are capable of being deployed quickly -- to 300,000 from the current level of around 40,000 personnel.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the leaders of the G-7 nations on Monday, pressing them for more heavy weaponry and help to end the war before winter sets in.\n\nUkraine's emergency services said the Russian missile strikes on a Ukrainian shopping mall yesterday killed at least 18 people and wounded 59 others.\n\nThe U.K.'s Ministry of Defence said that Russia's forces are becoming \"hollowed out\" in the Luhansk region amid a continuing, intense period of fighting in the area which is a part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn the latest intelligence update from the ministry on Tuesday, it noted that Ukrainian forces continue to consolidate their positions on higher ground in the city of Lyschansk, after pulling back from its neighboring city of Severodonetsk which Russian forces fully captured at the weekend.\n\nDespite this tactical retreat, the U.K. noted that Ukrainian forces \"continue to disrupt Russian command and control with successful strikes deep behind Russian lines.\"\n\nThe ministry noted that Russia had launched what it described as \"unusually intense waves of strikes across Ukraine using long-range missiles\" between June 24-26 and that these weapons highly likely included the Soviet-era AS-4 KITCHEN and more modern AS-23a KODIAK missiles, fired from both Belarusian and Russian airspace.\n\n\"These weapons were designed to take on targets of strategic importance, but Russia continues to expend them in large numbers for tactical advantage,\" it noted.\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nRussian officials have reacted to international condemnation over a missile strike on a shopping mall on Monday by posting false and unfounded claims about the attack.\n\nRussia's defense ministry issued a military update in which it claimed that they were targeting hangars in Kremenchuk holding weapons from European countries and the U.S. -- rather than the shopping mall that was struck by Russian missiles on Monday, killing at least 18 people and injuring many others.\n\nIt said that, \"as a result of the precision strike, Western-made weapons and ammunition being concentrated in the warehouse area for further dispatch to the Ukrainian group of troops in the Donbas were hit.\"\n\nThe ministry then claimed that \"the detonation of stored ammunition for Western weapons caused a fire in a non-functioning shopping center located next to the territory of the plant.\" The update comes after another Russian official claimed, presenting no evidence, that the shopping mall attack was a \"Ukrainian provocation.\"\n\nUkraine and Western military officials have said that there is no military target near the shopping mall in Kremenchuk. The shopping mall was believed to have around 1,000 people inside at the time of the strike yesterday.\n\nThe attack has been widely condemned by Western leaders with the G-7 calling it a war crime.\n\nIt's not the first time that Russia has responded to widespread criticism of its multiple assaults on civilians and civilian infrastructure by attempting to deny responsibility and to spread falsehoods and disinformation about the attack.\n\nIt has tried to claim that an attack on a maternity hospital early on in the war was staged by Ukraine despite abundant evidence to the contrary. It also tried to claim that a massacre of civilians in Bucha in Kyiv was staged by Ukraine and that footage and photographs of dead bodies were fake and created by Western media, again despite widespread evidence to the contrary.\n\nHuman rights groups and investigators are probing allegations of war crimes and have been gathering evidence of these during the conflict.\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nThe search and rescue operation continues at the shopping mall at Kremenchuk that was hit by Russian shelling on Monday. So far, 18 people are known to have died in the strike and 59 are injured, with 28 of them in intensive care.\n\nDamaged building structures are being dismantled with the help of heavy engineering equipment and small mechanization, Ukrainian officials said on Telegram today.\n\nG-7 leaders denounced the strike as a war crime, while Russia has denied that it targeted a civilian building on purpose.\n\nRussia's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Dmitry Polyanskiy, wrote on Twitter that the attack was a \"Ukrainian provocation.\" He cited no evidence for his claim.\n\n\"Exactly what Kiev regime needs to keep focus of attention on Ukraine before (the) NATO Summit,\" he said, referring to the alliance's meeting in Madrid that begins Tuesday.\n\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Dmitryo Kuleba said on Twitter today that it was \"sickening to see Russian reactions to the Kremenchuk shopping mall strike. Ordinary Russians cheer on social media. Russian diplomats and officials spread insane conspiracy theories, denying that the strike even happened.\"\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nThe death toll from the Russian missile strike on the Amstor shopping mall in Kremenchuk on Monday has risen to 18, according to a Ukrainian official.\n\n\"18 killed... Sincere condolences to relatives and friends. Rescuers continue to work,\" the head of the Poltava Regional Military Administration, Dmytro Lunin, posted on Telegram on Tuesday.\n\nRussian forces launched what Ukraine believes were Kh-22 missiles on a shopping mall in the town of Kremenchuk, a town along the Dnipro river which flows through the center of Ukraine. About 1,000 civilians were in the mall.\n\nEarlier, it was reported about 15 people had been killed in the attack. At least 59 people were injured, 25 of whom were hospitalized.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on the Telegram messaging platform that the strike on the mall in Kremenchuk had \"no strategic value\" and was not a site affiliated with Ukrainian armed forces.\n\nThe Kremlin has previously denied that it targets civilians.\n\nG-7 leaders condemned the attack on Monday, issuing a joint statement in which they said: \"We stand united with Ukraine in mourning the innocent victims of this brutal attack. Indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.\"\n\n\"Russian President Putin and those responsible will be held to account,\" the statement added.\n\nThe NATO military alliance is all set to meet in Madrid, Spain, on Tuesday, with the war in Ukraine at the top of the agenda.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has already previewed new moves by the alliance, announcing on Monday that it would increase its rapid response force and will bolster its battlegroups in eastern Europe.\n\n\"At the summit we will strengthen our forward defences. We will enhance our battlegroups in the eastern part of the alliance up to brigade levels. We will transform the NATO response force and increase the number of high-readiness forces to well over 300,000,\" Stoltenberg told a press conference.\n\nStoltenberg said the moves reflect that \"allies consider Russia as the most significant and direct threat to our security.\" The summit comes as Russia makes slow but significant headway in eastern Ukraine, seizing more of the Donbas as fierce fighting in the region continues.\n\nIn addition, Russian forces have attacked several major cities in recent days, including the capital Kyiv. An attack on a shopping mall yesterday killed at least 15 people and wounded 59 others. The attack was condemned by G-7 leaders meeting in Germany.\n\nNATO has other issues to deal with, the largest of which perhaps being Turkey's ongoing opposition to Finland's and Sweden's application to join the group. Stoltenberg said Monday that \"the security concerns of all allies must be taken into account as part of the NATO accession process. Turkiye's concerns are legitimate and must be addressed.\"\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nRussian missile strikes on a Ukrainian shopping mall killed at least 15 people and wounded 59 others, Ukraine's emergency services said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier said on the Telegram messaging platform that more than 1,000 people were inside at the time of the rocket attack, NBC News reported.\n\n\"This is not an off-target missile strike, this is a calculated Russian strike -- exactly at this shopping mall,\" Zelenskyy said in his nightly address.\n\n-- Chelsea Ong\n\nG-7 leaders condemned a Russian missile strike on a Ukrainian shopping mall that resulted in the death of innocent civilians.\n\n\"We stand united with Ukraine in mourning the innocent victims of this brutal attack. Indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime,\" the leaders wrote in a joint statement.\n\n\"Russian President Putin and those responsible will be held to account,\" the statement added.\n\nEarlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on the Telegram messaging platform that the strike on the mall in Kremenchuk had \"no strategic value\" and was not a site affiliated with Ukrainian armed forces.\n\nThe Kremlin has previously denied that it targets civilians.\n\n\"We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian as well as military support for Ukraine, for as long as it takes. We will not rest until Russia ends its cruel and senseless war on Ukraine,\" the G-7 leaders added.\n\n-- Amanda Macias\n\nTurkey's president says he will do \"whatever is necessary for our country's rights and interests\" at the NATO summit in Spain.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Monday he'd provide documents and visuals on \"terror groups,\" including Kurdish militant groups and the network of exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen blamed for a 2016 attempted coup in Turkey, to show his counterparts the \"hypocrisy\" on terror.\n\nAnkara has objected to Sweden's and Finland's bids to join NATO, citing what it considers to be a lax approach to groups Turkey deems national security threats, including the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, and its Syrian extension.\n\nTurkey has demanded the two Nordic countries extradite wanted individuals and lift arms restrictions imposed after Turkey's 2019 military incursion into northeast Syria.\n\n\"We will tell them clearly that it is not possible to expect a different attitude from Turkey unless this picture changes,\" he said after a cabinet meeting in Ankara.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan confirmed that the U.S. is in the final stages of preparing a security package for Ukraine that includes advanced air defense capabilities.\n\n\"We do intend to finalize a package that includes advanced medium- and long-range air defense capabilities for the Ukrainians, along with some other items that are of urgent need, including ammunition for artillery and counterbattery radar systems,\" Sullivan told reporters on the sidelines of the G-7 summit in Krun, Germany.\n\n\"I won't get into the details of the system. I'll wait until the contract actually gets done,\" he said. He added that President Joe Biden informed his G-7 counterparts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the upcoming security assistance package.\n\nThe U.S. has committed $6.1 billion in defense aid since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February.\n\n-- Amanda Macias\n\nThe NATO military alliance will increase the number of its forces at high readiness to over 300,000 from the current number of 40,000, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday.\n\n\"We will transform the NATO Response Force and increase the number of our high readiness forces to well over 300,000,\" said at a press conference on Monday, ahead of a NATO summit in Madrid that begins on Tuesday.\n\nThe summit would see NATO strengthen its forward defenses and enhance its battlegroups in the eastern part of the alliance, he said. \"We will also boost our ability to reinforce in crisis and conflict,\" he added. It would do this with:\n\nThe NATO Response Force is a high-readiness force comprising land, air, sea and special forces units that are capable of being deployed quickly. The force currently comprises around 40,000 troops.\n\nNATO's announcements come as the military alliance tries to best assist Ukraine in repelling the Russian invasion, with various NATO members sending arms to Kyiv, but trying to avoid a direct confrontation with nuclear power Russia.\n\nNATO's summit will see its 30 member countries meet, as well as representatives from its allies. Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea will join the summit for the first time, and Georgia and the European Union will also take part.\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nThe G-7 -- which comprises the world's most wealthy nations of the U.S., U.K., Canada, France, Italy, Germany and Japan -- has published a statement in which they affirm their continued support for Ukraine and committed to further punishing Russia on the economic front.\n\n\"We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,\" the G-7 said in the communique on Monday.\n\nThe groups said it was committed to sustaining and intensifying international economic and political pressure on President Putin's regime and what it called \"its enablers\" in Belarus, depriving Russia of the economic means to persist in its war of aggression against Ukraine.\n\nThe targeted use of coordinated sanctions would, the group said, continue \"for as long as necessary.\" Sanctions imposed on Russia so far were, the leaders said, \"in defence of the rules-based international order that Russia has so egregiously violated.\" And there would be more sanctions, they noted.\n\n\"We will continue to explore new ways to isolate Russia from participating in the global market and crack down on evasion. We are determined to reduce Russia's revenues, including from gold. We will also continue to target evasion and backfilling activities,\" the G-7 said.\n\nIt added that it would further reduce Russia's export revenues by taking \"appropriate steps to further reduce dependency on Russian energy,\" and \"further restrict Russia's access to key industrial inputs, services, and technologies produced by our economies, particularly those supporting Russia's armament industrial base and technology sector.\"\n\nFinally, the G-7 added that it will increase the costs of Russia's war on Ukraine by imposing targeted sanctions on those responsible for war crimes, exercising illegitimate authority in Ukraine, and those that it said were \"standing behind Russia's engagement in efforts to increase global food insecurity by stealing and exporting Ukrainian grain or otherwise profit illegitimately from the war.\"\n\nThe group said it would assist the global economy and would take action to help mitigate spillover effects from the sanctions, especially relating to humanitarian and other basic needs, and vulnerable populations.\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://media.nbcchicago.com/2022/06/107081413-16563637492022-06-27t205015z_936468832_rc2d0v9055xl_rtrmadp_0_ukraine-crisis-kremenchuk.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 38, "stanza_neu": 71, "stanza_pos": 7, "swn_neg": 116, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094675155", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "10:27:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T10:27:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T10:07:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6627451181411743, "url": "https://news.abplive.com/news/world/ukraine-mall-fire-16-dead-56-wounded-russian-missile-attack-ukraine-mall-kremenchuk-1539613", "title": "Ukraine Mall Fire: 16 Dead, 56 Wounded After Russian Missile Hits Shopping Complex", "body": "New Delhi: About 16 people lost their lives and 56 were wounded after a Russian missile strike on a shopping mall in the central city of Kremenchuk, the head of Ukraine's emergency services said early Tuesday, according to an AFP report. The Ukraine defence ministry said that the strike was timed so that a maximum number of victims are hit during the mall's busiest hours. According to the report, the Ukrainian air force said that Kh-22 anti-ship missiles were fired from Tu-22 bombers from the region of Kursk in western Russia.\n\n\"As of now, we know of 16 dead and 59 wounded, 25 of them hospitalised. The information is being updated,\" Sergiy Kruk said on Telegram, AFP reported.\n\nHe said the main tasks were \"rescue works, debris removal, and elimination of fires\" following Monday's strike on the shopping centre.\n\nThe Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said \"over a thousand civilians\" were in the mall when the missiles struck the city, which had a pre-war population of 220,000 people.\n\n\"The mall is on fire, rescuers are fighting the fire. The number of victims is impossible to imagine,\" Zelenskyy wrote on Facebook.

It was part of an unusually intense barrage of Russian fire across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv, that renewed international attention as the war drags on.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G7 summit in Germany, French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven leading industrialised democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\"\n\n\"Russia cannot and should not win,\" he said. He called Monday's attack on the mall \"a new war crime.\"\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian officials claimed the shopping centre was not the target.\n\nIn a virtual address to the U.N. Security Council, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia has become a terrorist state and called for it to be expelled from the United Nations. He also urged the U.N. to establish an international tribunal to investigate Russia's action in Ukraine.\n\nMr. Zelensky ended his address by asking all in the chamber to stand in silent tribute to the \"tens of thousands\" of Ukrainian children and adults killed in the war. All council members rose, including Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador Dmitry Polyansky.\n\nHow to counter Russia and back Ukraine will also be the focus of a summit this week of the NATO alliance, whose support has been critical to Kyiv's ability to fend off Moscow's larger and better equipped forces. Ukrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to hold off and even drive back Russia, which is pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.\n\nAs Mr. Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall, which officials said was struck when more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told AP that she had just arrived at the mall when an explosion knocked her down. When another blast came about 10 minutes later, she realised she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicenter with all of my strength,\" she said. Fighting back tears, she added: \"You have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said. Several of the bodies of those who didn't make it out in time are burned beyond recognition, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded, while 21 people were still missing.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theatre, a train station, and a hospital. Mr. Zelensky called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\"\n\nRocket attacks continued elsewhere in Ukraine, with authorities in the city of Dnipro reporting that workers at a diesel car repair shop were trapped in rubble after a strike from a cruise missile fired from the Black Sea, Ukrainian news agencies reported. The Ukrainian military managed to intercept and destroy other missiles fired at the city, the agencies said.\n\nAs condemnation came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals. He said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognising its control over territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire. Ukrainian authorities said that in addition to the direct hit on the mall, a factory was struck, but denied it housed weapons.\n\nMr. Konashenkov also falsely alleged that the mall was not in use.\n\nOne survivor, Oleksandr, a mall employee, told the AP from a hospital bed that the shopping centre was packed with customers. He recalled stepping outside with a colleague for a cigarette when the air raid siren went off.\n\n\"There was a black tunnel, smoke, fire,\" he said. \"I started to crawl. I saw the sun up there, and my brain was telling me I needed to save myself.\"\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity.\" She emphasised the need for all Ukrainians to remain alert and expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a six-year-old child. Six more people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a three-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire came as the G7 leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nMr. Zelensky has called for more air defence systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of a summit starting this week in Madrid, and an early signal of unity came Tuesday when Turkey agreed to lift its opposition to Sweden and Finland joining NATO.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine prompted the two Nordic countries to abandon their long-held nonaligned status and apply to join NATO. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had blocked the move, insisting they change their stance on Kurdish rebel groups that Turkey considers terrorists.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the West that \"the more weapons are pumped into Ukraine, the longer the conflict will continue and the longer the agony of the Nazi regime backed by Western capitals will last.\"\n\nRussia has falsely called the war a campaign to \"de-Nazify\" Ukraine -- a country with a democratically elected Jewish president who wants closer ties with the West.\n\nIn a sinister message to NATO leaders, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where their summit will be held.\n\nIt also posted images and the coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin -- referring to them as \"decision-making centres supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app. That wording echoes warnings from Russian President Vladimir Putin that he could target such centres in response to what he has called Western aggression.", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/go5bty/article65578521.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_615/2022-06-17T151440Z_1497175474_RC2RTU9IHKUW_RTRMADP_3_FRANCE-TECH-MACRON.JPG", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 40, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 51, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093923118", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "19:04:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T19:04:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T19:03:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.658823549747467, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/06/27/many-dead-russian-missile-hits-ukrainian-shopping-mall-1000/", "title": "'Many dead' as Russian missile hits Ukrainian shopping mall with over 1,000 inside", "body": "Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, says number of victims of attack in Kremenchuk 'is impossible to imagine'\n\nA Russian missile has hit a crowded shopping mall in central Ukraine, potentially killing hundreds in one of the deadliest attacks on civilians since the war began.\n\nVideo footage on Twitter showed flames and smoke billowing from the mall in the city of Kremenchuk, with dozens of people running across a car park away from the building.\n\nAnother video showed civilians helping overwhelmed emergency service crews to load people on stretchers into ambulances.\n\n\"Russia strikes a shopping centre in Kremenchuk while over a thousand people are inside,\" Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, said on his Telegram channel.\n\n\"The mall is on fire, firefighters are trying to extinguish the fire, the number of victims is impossible to imagine.\"\n\nA local official reported that there were \"many dead\", although casualty numbers have yet to be confirmed.\n\nKremenchuk is an industrial city of around 220,000 people by the Dnieper River.

It was part of unusually intense barrage of Russian fire across Ukraine, including in the capital of Kyiv, that renewed international attention as the war drags on.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G-7 summit in Germany, French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven leading industrialised democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\"\n\n\"Russia cannot and should not win,\" he said. He called Monday's attack on the mall \"a new war crime\".\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian authorities claimed that the shopping centre was not the target.\n\nHow to counter Russia and back Ukraine will also be the focus of a summit this week of the western NATO alliance, whose support has been critical to Kyiv's ability to fend off Moscow's larger and better equipped forces. Ukrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to hold off and even drive back Russia, which is pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern region of the Donbas.\n\nAs Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall that authorities said was struck when more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nALSO READ:\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, said that she had just arrived at the mall when an explosion knocked her down. When another blast came about 10 minutes later, she realised she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicentre with all of my strength,\" she said. Fighting back tears, she added: \"You have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said. Several of the bodies of those who didn't make it out in time are burned beyond recognition, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded. Another 21 people are still missing, Monastyrsky said.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theatre, a train station, and a hospital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history\".\n\nRocket attacks continued elsewhere in Ukraine, with authorities in the city of Dnipro reporting that workers at a diesel car repair shop were trapped in rubble after a strike from a cruise missile fired from the Black Sea, Ukrainian news agencies reported. The Ukrainian military managed to intercept and destroy other missiles fired at the city, the agencies said.\n\nAs condemnation came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfils its goals. He said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognising its control over territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian Defence Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire. Ukrainian authorities said that in addition to the direct hit on the mall, a factory was struck, but denied it housed weapons.\n\nKonashenkov also alleged that the mall was not in use, a false claim that witnesses contradicted.\n\nOne survivor, Oleksandr, a mall employee, told the AP from a hospital bed that the shopping centre was packed with customers. He recalled stepping outside with a colleague for a cigarette when the air raid siren went off.\n\n\"There was a black tunnel, smoke, fire,\" he said. \"I started to crawl. I saw the sun up there, and my brain was telling me I need to save myself.\"\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity.\" She emphasized the need for all Ukrainians to remain alert and expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. A further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire came as the G-7 leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the West that \"the more weapons are pumped into Ukraine, the longer the conflict will continue and the longer the agony of the Nazi regime backed by Western capitals will last\".\n\nIn a sinister message to NATO leaders, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where their summit will be held.\n\nIt also posted images and the coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin -- referring to them as \"decision-making centres supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app. That wording echoes Russian President Vladimir Putin's warnings that he could target such centres in response to what he has called Western aggression.\n\nIn other developments, the two fighting countries continued a sporadic series of prisoner exchanges. Ukraine exchanged 15 Russian prisoners-of-war for 16 Ukrainian soldiers and one civilian, the Ukrainian Pravda news outlet reported.\n\nUkrainian Pravda also reported that in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, the mayor was detained on Tuesday and occupying authorities seized his computer hard drive and documents after he had refused to cooperate with Russian-appointed local officials. Russia's Tass news agency confirmed the detention.\n\nMeanwhile, Bulgaria said on Tuesday it was expelling 70 Russian diplomats designated \"a threat to national security,\" ordering them to leave within five days.", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@khaleejtimes.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "image": "https://image.khaleejtimes.com?uuid=3fde196e-e6a2-5a1f-aa28-1f0c3911ba88&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.87417&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 14, "stanza_neu": 38, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 53, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093704873", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "15:31:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T15:31:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T14:46:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "url": "https://www.the-sun.com/news/5648629/dozens-feared-dead-russian-missile-shopping-centre-civilians/", "title": "Dozens feared dead as Russian missile hits shopping centre packed with 1,000 people sparking huge blaze", "body": "DOZENS of people have been feared dead after a Russian missile hit a shopping centre containing over 1,000 civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe missile struck in the city of Kremenchuk leaving many civilians still trapped inside - with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying the number of victims is \"impossible to imagine\".\n\nAt least two people have been confirmed dead and 20 injured - but the number of victims is expected to rise.\n\nHorrifying videos show the entire Amstor shopping centre in flames as firefighters battle the inferno.\n\nPeople are seen gathered outside watching the horrifying scene unfold as shouts and screams can be heard.\n\nAnd other footage shows people escaping from the shopping mall as they flee the blaze.\n\nIt is reported there were at least 1,000 people inside at the time of the assault.\n\nIn one harrowing video, a male voice is heard shouting: \"Is anyone alive?

It was part of an unusually intense barrage of Russian fire across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv, that renewed international attention as the war drags on.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G-7 summit, French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven leading industrialized democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\"\n\n\"Russia cannot and should not win,\" he said. He called Monday's attack on the mall \"a new war crime.\"\n\nAs they have in other attacks that have killed large numbers of Ukrainian civilians, Russian officials claimed the shopping center was not the target.\n\nIn a virtual address to the U.N. Security Council, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being a \"terrorist\" and called for Russia to be expelled from the United Nations. He also urged the U.N. to establish an international tribunal to investigate Russia's actions in Ukraine.\n\nZelensky ended his address by asking all in the chamber to stand in silent tribute to the \"tens of thousands\" of Ukrainian children and adults killed in the war. All council members rose, including Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador, Dmitry Polyansky.\n\nHow to counter Russia and back Ukraine will also be the focus of a summit this week of the NATO alliance, whose support has been crucial to Kyiv's ability to fend off Russia's larger and better-equipped forces. Ukrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to hold off and even drive back Russian forces, who are pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.\n\nAs Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall, which officials said was struck Monday with more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers inside.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told the Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when an explosion knocked her down. When another blast came about 10 minutes later, she realized she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicenter with all of my strength,\" she said. Fighting back tears, she added: \"You have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air-raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky said. Several of the bodies of those who didn't make it out in time are burned beyond recognition, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded, while 21 people were still missing.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theater, a train station and a hospital. Zelensky called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\"\n\nRocket attacks continued elsewhere in Ukraine, with authorities in the city of Dnipro reporting that workers at a diesel car repair shop were trapped in rubble after a strike from a cruise missile fired from the Black Sea, Ukrainian news agencies reported. The Ukrainian military managed to intercept and destroy other missiles fired at the city, the agencies said.\n\nAs condemnation came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals. He said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including ceding control over territory Russia has taken by force.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire. Ukrainian authorities said that in addition to the direct hit on the mall, a factory was struck, but denied it housed weapons.\n\nKonashenkov also falsely alleged that the mall was not in use.\n\nOne survivor, Oleksandr, a mall employee, told the AP from a hospital bed that the shopping center was packed with customers. He recalled stepping outside with a colleague for a cigarette when the air-raid siren went off.\n\n\"There was a black tunnel, smoke, fire,\" he said. \"I started to crawl. I saw the sun up there, and my brain was telling me I needed to save myself.\"\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity.\" She emphasized the need for all Ukrainians to remain alert and expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. Six more people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire came as the G-7 leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nZelensky has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of a summit starting this week in Madrid, and an early signal of unity came Tuesday when Turkey agreed to lift its opposition to Sweden and Finland joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine prompted the two Nordic countries to abandon their long-held nonaligned status and apply to join NATO. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had initially blocked the move, insisting they change their stance on Kurdish rebel groups that Turkey considers terrorist organizations.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the West that \"the more weapons are pumped into Ukraine, the longer the conflict will continue and the longer the agony of the Nazi regime backed by Western capitals will last.\"\n\nRussia has falsely called the war a campaign to \"denazify\" Ukraine -- a country with a democratically elected Jewish president who wants closer ties with the West.\n\nIn an ominous message to NATO leaders, Russia's state space corporation, Roscosmos, published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where the summit will be held.\n\nIt also posted images and the coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin -- referring to them as \"decision-making centers supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app. That wording echoes Putin's warnings that he could target such centers in response to what he has called Western aggression.\n\nIn other developments, the two fighting countries continued a sporadic series of prisoner exchanges. Ukraine exchanged 15 Russian prisoners of war for 16 Ukrainian soldiers and one civilian, the Ukrainian Pravda news outlet reported Tuesday.\n\nUkrainian Pravda also reported that in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, the mayor was detained Tuesday and occupying authorities seized his computer hard drive and documents after he had refused to cooperate with Russian-appointed local officials. Russia's Tass news agency confirmed the detention.\n\nMeanwhile, Bulgaria said Tuesday it was expelling 70 Russian diplomats designated \"a threat to national security,\" ordering them to leave within five days. A Bulgarian Foreign Ministry statement said this would reduce Russia's Sofia embassy staff \"to up to 23 diplomatic and 25 administrative and technical staff.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iaiMjPPEkCZkoQSRaRzetA--~B/aD01NjA7dz04NDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/la_times_articles_853/cc3f2e0756371e1f4434a44d13a13d98", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 14, "stanza_neu": 42, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 57, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093927476", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "19:08:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T19:08:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T19:08:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6509804129600525, "url": "https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/world-news/20220627/officials-russian-missile-strike-hits-crowded-shopping-mall", "title": "Officials: Russian missile strike hits crowded shopping mall", "body": "SLOVIANSK, Ukraine (AP) -- Scores of civilians were feared killed or wounded in a Russian missile strike Monday on a crowded shopping mall in Ukraine's central city of Kremenchuk, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post that the number of victims was \"unimaginable,\" citing reports that more than 1,000 civilians were inside at the time of the attack.\n\nImages from the scene showed giant plumes of black smoke from the shopping centre engulfed in flames, as emergency crews rushed in and onlookers watched in distress.\n\nAt least 11 people were dead and more than 40 wounded, according to the regional governor, Dmytro Lunin, who said that rescuers were continuning to comb the smouldering debris for more victims.\n\nZelenskyy said the target presented \"no threat to the Russian army\" and had \"no strategic value.\"\n\nHe accused Russia of sabotaging \"people's attempts to live a normal life, which make the occupiers so angry.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian military said the shopping centre was hit by missiles fired by Russian Tu-22M3 long-range bombers from the skies over Russia's western Kursk region.\n\nThe secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, Oleksiy Danilov, said that one missile hit the shopping centre and another struck a sports arena in Kremenchuk.", "source": {"uri": "jamaica-gleaner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jamaica Gleaner"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2022/06/27/car_cropped.jpg?itok=lt6ghfgA", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 5, "stanza_neu": 3, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 8, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094985070", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "14:31:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T14:31:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T14:31:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6509804129600525, "url": "https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/update-20-dead-59-injured-40-missing-after-russian-strike-on-kremenchuk.html", "title": "Update: 20 Dead, 59 Injured, 40 Missing After Russian Strike on Kremenchuk - KyivPost - Ukraine's Global Voice", "body": "Condemned by President Volodymyr Zelensky as a \"brazen terrorist act\", the Russian attack on a busy shopping Centre in the central city of Kremenchuk has seen the death toll rise to 18 today, Tuesday, 28 June.\n\nEmergency services said that 20 innocent civilians caught in the blasts had died, while 59 were injured and 25 were hospitalized.

May be the deadliest Russian missile strike since the war began.\"\n\nThe city's mayor, Vitaliy Meletskiy, said in a post on Facebook that the strike hit a \"very crowded\" place and stated that there were \"multiple casualties\".\n\nDmytro Lunin, governor of Poltava Region, said on Telegram that the incident is: \"A crime against humanity. This is an open and cynical act of terror against the civilian population. Russia is a terrorist state.\"\n\nPresident Zelensky said the attack showed it was impossible to \"expect decency and humanity\" from Russia, while Mykhaylo Podolyak, an adviser to the president, said Russia had attacked the shopping centre \"just because it wants to kill\", calling it \"a terrorist state\".\n\nThe UN swiftly described the attack as \"deplorable\", while US President Joe Biden branded it \"cruel\". British Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the incident as \"appalling\", adding that it demonstrated \"once again the depths of cruelty and barbarism to which the Russian leader will sink\".\n\nDespite evidence, including video footage, clearly indicating that Russia had attacked the site, and that the shopping centre simply contains retail outlets and civilians, Moscow's defense ministry said on Tuesday, June 28 that the blaze there was caused by the \"detonation of stored ammunition for western weapons\", adding: \"On June 27, in the city of Kremenchuk, Russian forces delivered a strike with high-precision air-based weapons on hangars with weapons and ammunition received from the United States and European countries.\n\nAs a result of a high-precision strike, western-made weapons and ammunition concentrated in a storage area for further shipment to the Ukrainian group of troops in Donbas were hit.

However, the Russian Defence Ministry claimed that the attack was aimed at a weapons depot nearby and the fire spread to the \"supposedly empty mall.\" According to Ukrainian officials, more than 1,000 people were inside the mall at the time of the attack, with at least 18 people losing their lives and over 60 others injured, the Associated Press (AP) reported.\n\nUkrainian officials also blamed Russia's Tu-22M3 long-range bombers for firing the missile that targeted the shopping mall and a sports arena in Kremenchuk city.

The attack comes at a time when Russia was launching a full-scale assault on the last Ukrainian stronghold in eastern Luhansk.\n\nIn its latest operation report, the Russian Defence Ministry also claimed that the country's armed forces are still engaged in a special military operation in Ukraine. \"Successful joint actions of the Russian troops, units of the people's militia of the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics inflict critical losses on the Armed Forces of Ukraine,\" the ministry stated on Telegram. It further stated that the Russian Aerospace Forces launched a strike with high-precision air-based weapons on hangars with weapons and ammunition in Kremenchuk city on June 27. The Russian Ministry also claimed that those weapons were provided to Ukraine by the United States and European countries.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that the ongoing devastating war between Russia and Ukraine continues to escalate and entered its day 125th on Tuesday, June 28. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has reiterated his demands for fresh sanctions on Russia by Group of Seven (G7) countries and also urged for the delivery of additional weapons and air defence systems to Ukraine.

Footage that appeared to be captured by people running for the exits showed them navigating a thick cloud of debris and dust as they clambered over broken windows, doors and crumbling walls.\n\nBy Monday evening, Ukrainian media reported that 115 firefighters had managed to put out the massive blaze and rescuers were continuing to search through the debris for survivors.\n\nUkraine's Defense Ministry said the strike had been carried out by a Russian X-22 missile weighing nearly 2,000 pounds, and had been fired from Russia's Kursk region, near the border.\n\nKremenchuk had a population of almost 220,000 people before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in late February.\n\nDmitry Polyanskiy, a deputy Russian ambassador to the United Nations, suggested on Twitter that the explosion and fire had been caused by the Ukrainians themselves.

The Pentagon said Monday that Russia launched about 60 missile strikes across Ukraine over the weekend, including an attack that hit an apartment building in Kyiv, killing one.\n\nG-7 leaders from the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan condemned the attack Monday, calling it \"abominable\" and vowing \"unwavering support\" for Ukraine. \"Indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime,\" their statement said. \"We will not rest until Russia ends its cruel and senseless war on Ukraine.\"\n\nUkrainian officials urged G-7 leaders and other Western nations to supply Ukraine with more sophisticated weapons, including antimissile systems they say would protect their cities against Russian attacks.\n\nAndriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential office, wrote on Twitter on Monday that the attack showed Russia should be \"designated a state sponsor of terrorism\" and called for more weapons. \"We need missile defenses,\" he said.\n\nJust hours before the strike Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to G-7 leaders through a video conference. He asked them for more heavy weapons, including antiaircraft weapons, to force a Russian retreat before winter, according to a person briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private discussions.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Monday that President Joe Biden has told Zelensky the United States intends to provide Kyiv with advanced air defense capabilities, though he did not provide more details.\n\nThe Amstor mall was crowded with shoppers on Monday afternoon when at least one missile struck it, according to Ukrainian officials. Videos shared from the scene show buildings engulfed in smoke and civilians running for cover. Dmitry Lunin, the governor of the Poltava region, said 40 people were wounded, including two children, with 15 dead. With the rescue mission still ongoing, officials warned the number is likely to rise.\n\nZelensky said in a Telegram message Monday that there were more than 1,000 civilians at the mall when the missile hit, adding that the shoppers were \"no danger to the Russian army.\" The final number of victims, he said, was \"impossible to imagine.\"\n\nKremenchuk, a city of more than 200,000 before the invasion, is a large industrial center for the Poltava region. The Ukrainian Air Force Command said the mall had been hit by at least one Kh-22 missile fired by Tu-22 M3 bombers operating in the Kursk region of Russia, near the Ukrainian border. Russian officials and state-run media outlets have suggested, without evidence, that the attack on the shopping mall was a deliberately staged provocation by Ukrainian forces.\n\nKh-22 missiles are long-range weapons that were originally designed for use against ships. In a publicly issued note released earlier this month, the British Defense Ministry warned that these Soviet-era weapons were being used against land targets in Ukraine and that they were \"highly inaccurate and therefore can cause severe collateral damage and casualties.\"\n\nA senior U.S. defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, said it is not clear why Russia has ramped up its attacks.

More than a dozen of people were killed.\n\nBy FRANCESCA EBEL and YURAS KARMANAU - Associated Press\n\nKREMENCHUK, Ukraine (AP) -- French President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday that Russia \"cannot and should not win\" the war in Ukraine, a day after a Russian missile attack on a crowded shopping mall that killed 18 put the conflict's terrible toll on full view.\n\nUkrainian and Western leaders have denounced the strike as a war crime and a terrorist attack and it drew swift condemnation from the Group of Seven leaders meeting in Europe at the time. It came during an unusually intense barrage of Russian strikes all across Ukraine, including in the capital of Kyiv, that drew new attention to a war that some fear could fade from the headlines as it drags on.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G-7 summit in Germany, Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven industrialized democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\"\n\n\"Russia cannot and should not win,\" he said, adding that Monday's attack on the mall was \"a new war crime.\"\n\nAs he spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall in Kremenchuk that authorities said was struck when more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theater, a train station, and a hospital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\" The G-7 leaders said \"indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.\"\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the attack.\n\nStriking a defiant note, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals, noting that the hostilities could end \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to meet the Russian demands and orders its troops to surrender.\n\nThe Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine recognize Russia's sovereignty over Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, acknowledge the independence of Moscow-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, and recognize the current situation, an apparent reference gains Russia has made since the start of the war.\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian authorities claimed that the mall was not the target. Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot containing Western weapons and ammunition, causing powerful blasts that set the mall on fire.\n\nUkrainian officials have directly contradicted that, saying the mall itself was hit in the strike. Wayne Jordash, a British lawyer who is working with Ukrainian officials to investigate possible war crimes, meanwhile. said that initial indications were that there were no military targets nearby, but the investigation is ongoing. He did say a factory nearby was also hit.\n\nKonashenkov also alleged that the mall was not in use, a false claim contradicted by witnesses.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when there was an explosion. The blast knocked her down. When another came about 10 minutes later, she realized she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicenter with all of my strength,\" she said. \"It was terrifying.\"\n\nFighting back tears, she said that \"you have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nThe regional governor, Dmytro Lunin, said at least 18 people were killed in the attack and 59 others sought medical assistance, of whom 25 were hospitalized. The region declared a day of mourning Tuesday for the victims of the attack.\n\nUkrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said after visiting the scene that many bodies were burned beyond recognition and their identification could take days, adding that 21 people were considered missing.\n\nMonastyrsky noted that most of up to 1,000 people who were in the mall when an air raid siren sounded quickly moved to a shelter across the road.\n\n\"Unfortunately, those people who stayed during the air alarm died only because they remained there,\" he added, urging both businesses and customers to adhere to safety protocols and quickly get to safety after an attack warning.\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity,\" noting that Moscow's military has been \"systematically shelling civilian infrastructure with the aim to scare people, to kill people, to bring terror to our cities and villages.\"\n\nVenediktova emphasized the need for Ukrainians across the entire country to remain alert, adding that they should expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire in recent days came as the G-7 leaders gathered in Europe. They pledged continued support for Ukraine and the world's major economies prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nThe Russian strike echoed earlier attacks that caused large numbers of civilian casualties -- such as one in March on a Mariupol theater where many civilians had holed up, killing an estimated 600, and another in April on a train station in eastern Kramatorsk that killed at least 59 people.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv in the Mykolaiv region, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. A further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to local officials.\n\nRussia has increasingly used long-range bombers in the war. Ukrainian officials said Russian Tu-22M3 long-range bombers flying over Russia's western Kursk region fired the missiles, one of which hit the shopping center and another that struck a sports arena in Kremenchuk.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. The U.S. appeared ready to respond to that call, and NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of its summit this week.\n\nThe attack on Kremenchuk came as Russia was pressing an all-out assault on the last Ukrainian stronghold in eastern Luhansk province -- part of its campaign to wrest the eastern Donbas region from Ukraine.\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

This is currently the situation in Kremenchuk due to the missile strikes,\" said Dmytro Lunin, the governor of the Poltava region where Kremenchuk is located.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said \"over a thousand civilians\" were in the mall when the missiles struck the city, which had a pre-war population of 220,000 people.\n\n\"The mall is on fire, rescuers are fighting the fire. The number of victims is impossible to imagine,\" Zelensky wrote on Facebook.\n\nA video shared by Zelensky showed the mall engulfed in flames with dozens of rescuers and a fire truck outside.\n\nEmergency services also published images showing the smouldering remains of the building, with firefighters and rescuers trying to clear the debris.\n\nAt least eight civilians were also killed and 21 wounded in Russian missile attack on Lysychansk yesterday, Serhiy Gaidai, governor of the Luhansk region said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\n\"Today, when the civilian people were collecting water from a water tank, the Russians aimed at the crowd,\" Gaidai said.\n\nThe Ukrainian defence ministry said the mall strike was deliberately timed to coincide with the mall's busiest hours and cause the maximum number of victims. The Ukrainian air force said the mall was hit by Kh-22 anti-ship missiles fired from Tu-22 bombers from the region of Kursk in western Russia.\n\n\"The missile fire on Kremenchuk struck a very busy area which had no link to the hostilities,\" the city's mayor Vitali Maletsky wrote on Facebook.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called on Kyiv's allies to supply more heavy weapons and impose fresh sanctions on Russia. \"Russia is a disgrace to humanity and it must face consequences,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe US ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink said the world would \"hold the Kremlin accountable for its atrocities\".\n\nWestern nations yesterday pledged unwavering support for Ukraine in the war with Russia, including more sanctions on Moscow and air-defence systems, as Russian forces closed in on the last big city still held by Ukrainian troops in eastern Luhansk province.\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven major democracies, meeting at a German alpine resort, said they would keep sanctions on Russia for as long as necessary and intensify international pressure on President Vladimir Putin's government and its ally Belarus.\n\n\"Imagine if we allowed Putin to get away with the violent acquisition of huge chunks of another country, sovereign, independent territory,\" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC.\n\n\"The lessons for that would be absolutely chilling. The point I would make to people is I think that sometimes the price of freedom is worth paying.\"\n\nThe United States said it was finalising a weapons package for Ukraine that would include long-range air-defence systems -- arms that Zelensky specifically requested when he addressed the leaders by video link yesterday.\n\nDespite the boost from its allies, Ukraine was enduring another difficult day on the battlefront following the loss of the now-ruined city of Sievierodonetsk after weeks of bombardment and street fighting.\n\nRussian artillery was pounding Lysychansk, its twin just across the Siverskyi Donets River, which Luhansk province governor Serhiy Gaidai said was suffering \"catastrophic\" damage. He urged civilians to evacuate urgently. The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said the Russians were trying to cut off Lysychansk from the south. Russian war planes had also struck near the city, the general staff said in its daily update.\n\nA senior US defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Russia had carried out about 60 strikes against Ukraine over the weekend.\n\nIn his address to the G7 leaders, Zelensky had pleaded for more arms, US and European officials said. He asked for help to export grain from Ukraine and for more sanctions on Russia.\n\nThe G7 nations promised to tighten the squeeze on Russia's finances with sanctions, including a deal to cap the price of Russian oil that a US official said was \"close\", and promised up to $29.5bn more for Ukraine.\n\n\"We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,\" a G7 statement said.\n\nNato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said its troops on high readiness would be massively boosted to over 300,000, with the Western alliance set to adopt a new strategy describing Moscow as a direct threat.\n\n\"They have chosen confrontation instead of dialogue.

Zelenskyy called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\"\n\nMORE ATTACKS\n\nRocket attacks continued elsewhere in Ukraine, with authorities in Dnipro reporting that workers at a diesel car repair shop were trapped in rubble after a strike from a cruise missile fired from the Black Sea, Ukrainian news agencies reported. The Ukrainian military managed to intercept and destroy other missiles fired at the city, the agencies said.\n\nAs condemnation came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals. He said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognizing its control over territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire. Ukrainian authorities said that in addition to the direct hit on the mall, a factory was struck, but denied it housed weapons.\n\nKonashenkov also falsely alleged that the mall was not in use.\n\nOne survivor, Oleksandr, a mall employee, told the AP from a hospital bed that the shopping center was packed with customers. He recalled stepping outside with a colleague for a cigarette when the air raid siren went off.\n\n\"There was a black tunnel, smoke, fire,\" he said. \"I started to crawl. I saw the sun up there, and my brain was telling me I needed to save myself.\"\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity.\" She emphasized the need for all Ukrainians to remain alert and expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. Six more people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire came as the G-7 leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the West that \"the more weapons are pumped into Ukraine, the longer the conflict will continue and the longer the agony of the Nazi regime backed by Western capitals will last.\"\n\nRussia has falsely called the war a campaign to \"de-Nazify\" Ukraine -- a country with an elected Jewish president who wants closer ties with the West.\n\nIn a sinister message to NATO leaders, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where their summit will be held.\n\nIt also posted images and the coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin -- referring to them as \"decision-making centers supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app. That wording echoes warnings from Russian President Vladimir Putin that he could target such centers in response to what he has called Western aggression.\n\nBIDENS BANNED\n\nIn other developments, Russia announced Tuesday that it was banning the wife and daughter of President Joe Biden from entering the country, in response to widening sanctions against Russia.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry said 25 names were being added to the country's \"stop list\" including Biden's wife Jill and daughter Ashley.\n\nRussia also banned entry to four senators whom it identified as \"responsible for the formation of the [U.S.] Russophobic course\" -- Republicans Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins and Ben Sasse and Democrat Kirstin Gillibrand.\n\nThe list also includes academics including Francis Fukuyama, noted for his book \"The End of History and the Last Man\" that posited the spread of liberal democracies could mark the ultimate development of society.\n\nThe Russian news agency reported late Tuesday that one of the two Britons sentenced to death by separatist forces in eastern Ukraine has filed a formal appeal. The report said the appeal filed on behalf of Shaun Pinner will be considered within two months.\n\nPinner, Aiden Aslin and Moroccan Brahim Saadoun were sentenced to death on June 9 and were given one month to appeal. The court claimed they were fighting for Ukraine as mercenaries so they were not entitled to protections provided to prisoners of war.\n\nThere was no mention of appeals for the other two men.\n\nThe two fighting countries also continued a sporadic series of prisoner exchanges. Ukraine exchanged 15 Russian prisoners-of-war for 16 Ukrainian soldiers and one civilian, the Ukrainian Pravda news outlet reported Tuesday.\n\nUkrainian Pravda also reported that in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, the mayor was detained Tuesday and occupying authorities seized his computer hard drive and documents after he had refused to cooperate with Russian-appointed local officials. Tass confirmed the detention.\n\nBulgaria said Tuesday it was expelling 70 Russian diplomats designated \"a threat to national security,\" ordering them to leave within five days. A Bulgarian foreign ministry statement said this would reduce Russia's Sofia embassy staff \"to up to 23 diplomatic and 25 administrative and technical staff.\"\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Francesca Ebel, Yuras Karmanau, Oleksandr Stashevskyi, Edith M.

(AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky)\n\nKREMENCHUK, Ukraine (AP) -- French President Emmanuel Macron said today that Russia \"cannot and should not win\" the war in Ukraine, a day after a Russian missile attack on a crowded shopping mall that killed 18 put the conflict's terrible toll on full view.\n\nUkrainian and Western leaders have denounced the strike as a war crime and a terrorist attack and it drew swift condemnation from the Group of Seven leaders meeting in Europe at the time. It came during an unusually intense barrage of Russian strikes all across Ukraine, including in the capital of Kyiv, that drew new attention to a war that some fear could fade from the headlines as it drags on.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G-7 summit in Germany, Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven industrialized democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\"\n\n\"Russia cannot and should not win,\" he said, adding that Monday's attack on the mall was \"a new war crime.\"\n\nAs he spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall in Kremenchuk that authorities said was struck when more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theater, a train station, and a hospital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\" The G-7 leaders said \"indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.\"\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York today to discuss the attack.\n\nStriking a defiant note, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals, noting that the hostilities could end \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to meet the Russian demands and orders its troops to surrender.\n\nThe Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine recognize Russia's sovereignty over Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, acknowledge the independence of Moscow-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, and recognize the current situation, an apparent reference gains Russia has made since the start of the war.\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian authorities claimed that the mall was not the target. Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot containing Western weapons and ammunition, causing powerful blasts that set the mall on fire.\n\nUkrainian officials have directly contradicted that, saying the mall itself was hit in the strike. Wayne Jordash, a British lawyer who is working with Ukrainian officials to investigate possible war crimes, said that initial indications were that there were no military targets nearby, but the investigation is ongoing. He did say a factory nearby was also hit.\n\nKonashenkov also alleged that the mall was not in use, a false claim contradicted by witnesses.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when there was an explosion. The blast knocked her down. When another came about 10 minutes later, she realized she needed to get away.\n\nThe regional governor, Dmytro Lunin, said at least 18 people were killed in the attack and 59 others sought medical assistance, of whom 25 were hospitalized. The region declared a day of mourning today for the victims of the attack.\n\nUkrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said after visiting the scene that many bodies were burned beyond recognition and their identification could take days, adding that 21 people were considered missing.\n\nMonastyrsky noted that most of up to 1,000 people who were in the mall when an air raid siren sounded quickly moved to a shelter across the road.\n\n\"Unfortunately, those people who stayed during the air alarm died only because they remained there,\" he added, urging both businesses and customers to adhere to safety protocols and quickly get to safety after an attack warning.\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity,\" noting that Moscow's military has been \"systematically shelling civilian infrastructure with the aim to scare people, to kill people, to bring terror to our cities and villages.\"\n\nVenediktova emphasized the need for Ukrainians across the entire country to remain alert, adding that they should expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire in recent days came as the G-7 leaders gathered in Europe. They pledged continued support for Ukraine and the world's major economies prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nThe Russian strike echoed earlier attacks that caused large numbers of civilian casualties -- such as one in March on a Mariupol theater where many civilians had holed up, killing an estimated 600, and another in April on a train station in eastern Kramatorsk that killed at least 59 people.\n\nToday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv in the Mykolaiv region, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. A further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to local officials.\n\nRussia has increasingly used long-range bombers in the war. Ukrainian officials said Russian Tu-22M3 long-range bombers flying over Russia's western Kursk region fired the missiles, one of which hit the shopping center and another that struck a sports arena in Kremenchuk.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. The U.S. appeared ready to respond to that call, and NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of its summit this week.\n\nThe attack on Kremenchuk came as Russia was pressing an all-out assault on the last Ukrainian stronghold in eastern Luhansk province -- part of its campaign to wrest the eastern Donbas region from Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "tribtoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tribune Chronicle, Warren OH"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/ogden_images/www.tribtoday.com/images/2022/06/28084314/AP22179238237203-750x500.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 31, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 43, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093682274", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "15:12:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T15:12:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T15:12:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6392157077789307, "url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/world/russia-ukraine-war/story/russian-missile-strike-shopping-mall-east-ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskyy-1967403-2022-06-27", "title": "2 dead, 20 injured as missile hits 'crowded' shopping mall in Ukraine", "body": "A Russian missile hit a \"crowded\" mall in east Ukraine today, killing two and injuring 20, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

In all the parts of the world, any organization acted just like Russia which is killing Ukrainians? If a country killed any peaceful people, that would definitely be recognized as terrorism. Such an organization would become an enemy for all of humankind. Therefore, what is punished at the level of concrete criminals and criminal organizations must not go unchecked at the level of the state which has become a terrorist, daily terrorist acts without weekends. Every day they are working as terrorists.\"\n\nHe confirmed that 18 people had died in the mall attack in Kremenchuk, citing an additional 50 injured with dozens missing, going into graphic detail.\n\n\"Seven fragments of bodies have been found ripped off limbs, hands, and feet of the people. Any of the Russian states claims that all these victims suffered not from its missile strike, then I suggest the United Nations send either a special representative of the secretary-general of the United Nations or a plenipotentiary commission to decide if this (was a) terrorist act at Kremenchuk so that the UN could independently find out all the information and see that this indeed was a Russian missile strike.\"\n\n'Bucha-styled provocation'\n\nRussia accused Ukraine of propaganda and continued to claim it targeted a western-supplied arms depot that triggered a fire at a nearby mall.\n\n\"In order to return the attention of the world community back to Ukraine even though it was becoming fatigued, a new Bucha-styled provocation was necessary, but the problem was that the Russian army had not retreated from anywhere for a long time and planting corpses or shooting civilians only made sense on territories that had been brought back under Kiyv's control. That is when apparently the idea came to stage a new type of provocation, an alleged strike on a shopping centre in Kremenchuk,\" says Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy Russia's Deputy Permanent Representative.\n\nRussia refutes Ukraine's claims about the mall attack:\n\nThe United Nations says it has recorded over 10 000 civilian casualties including more than 4700 killed and 5900 injured with the Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo saying they'd run out of words to describe the senselessness, futility, and cruelty of the war.\n\n\"The depravity of the war was again on full display yesterday following the missile strike in Kremenchuk, in the central Poltava region. Hundreds of people, perhaps even some trying to get a respite from the daily horrors of the war, suffered one of the most shocking attacks of the conflict when a shopping center was hit by what are reported to be Russian missiles.\"\n\nIn a joint statement, western nations of the council underlined the need for an objective independent investigation expressing full support for the ongoing probe by the International Criminal Court.", "source": {"uri": "sabcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SABC News - Breaking news, special reports, world, business, sport coverage of all South African current events.

It was part of an unusually intense barrage of Russian fire across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv, that renewed international attention as the war drags on.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G-7 summit in Germany, French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven leading industrialized democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\"\n\n\"Russia cannot and should not win,\" he said. He called Monday's attack on the mall \"a new war crime.\"\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian officials claimed the shopping center was not the target.\n\nIn a virtual address to the U.N. Security Council, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being a \"terrorist\" and called for Russia to be expelled from the United Nations. He also urged the U.N. to establish an international tribunal to investigate Russia's action in Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZelenskyy ended his address by asking all in the chamber to stand in silent tribute to the \"tens of thousands\" of Ukrainian children and adults killed in the war. All council members rose, including Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador Dmitry Polyansky.\n\nHow to counter Russia and back Ukraine will also be the focus of a summit this week of the NATO alliance, whose support has been critical to Kyiv's ability to fend off Moscow's larger and better equipped forces. Ukrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to hold off and even drive back Russia, which is pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.\n\nAs Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall, which officials said was struck when more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when an explosion knocked her down. When another blast came about 10 minutes later, she realized she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicenter with all of my strength,\" she said. Fighting back tears, she added: \"You have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said. Several of the bodies of those who didn't make it out in time are burned beyond recognition, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded, while 21 people were still missing.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theater, a train station, and a hospital. Zelenskyy called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\"\n\nRocket attacks continued elsewhere in Ukraine, with authorities in the city of Dnipro reporting that workers at a diesel car repair shop were trapped in rubble after a strike from a cruise missile fired from the Black Sea, Ukrainian news agencies reported. The Ukrainian military managed to intercept and destroy other missiles fired at the city, the agencies said.\n\nAs condemnation came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals. He said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognizing its control over territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire. Ukrainian authorities said that in addition to the direct hit on the mall, a factory was struck, but denied it housed weapons.\n\nKonashenkov also falsely alleged that the mall was not in use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne survivor, Oleksandr, a mall employee, told the AP from a hospital bed that the shopping center was packed with customers. He recalled stepping outside with a colleague for a cigarette when the air raid siren went off.\n\n\"There was a black tunnel, smoke, fire,\" he said. \"I started to crawl. I saw the sun up there, and my brain was telling me I needed to save myself.\"\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity.\" She emphasized the need for all Ukrainians to remain alert and expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. Six more people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire came as the G-7 leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of a summit starting this week in Madrid, and an early signal of unity came Tuesday when Turkey agreed to lift its opposition to Sweden and Finland joining NATO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine prompted the two Nordic countries to abandon their long-held nonaligned status and apply to join NATO. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had blocked the move, insisting they change their stance on Kurdish rebel groups that Turkey considers terrorists.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the West that \"the more weapons are pumped into Ukraine, the longer the conflict will continue and the longer the agony of the Nazi regime backed by Western capitals will last.\"\n\nRussia has falsely called the war a campaign to \"de-Nazify\" Ukraine - a country with a democratically elected Jewish president who wants closer ties with the West.\n\nIn a sinister message to NATO leaders, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where their summit will be held.\n\nIt also posted images and the coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin -- referring to them as \"decision-making centers supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app. That wording echoes Putin's warnings that he could target such centers in response to what he has called Western aggression.\n\nIn other developments:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* One of the two Britons sentenced to death by separatist forces in eastern Ukraine has filed a formal appeal, the Russian news agency Tass reported early Wednesday. The report said the appeal filed on behalf of Shaun Pinner will be considered within two months.\n\nPinner, Aiden Aslin and Moroccan Brahim Saadoun were sentenced to death on June 9 and were given one month to appeal. The court claimed they were fighting for Ukraine as mercenaries so were not entitled to protections provided to prisoners of war. There was no mention of appeals for the other two men.\n\n* The two fighting countries continued a sporadic series of prisoner exchanges. Ukraine exchanged 15 Russian prisoners-of-war for 16 Ukrainian soldiers and one civilian, the Ukrainian Pravda news outlet reported Tuesday.\n\n* Ukrainian Pravda also reported that in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, the mayor was detained Tuesday and occupying authorities seized his computer hard drive and documents after he had refused to cooperate with Russian-appointed local officials. Russia's Tass news agency confirmed the detention.\n\n* Bulgaria said Tuesday it was expelling 70 Russian diplomats designated \"a threat to national security,\" ordering them to leave within five days. A Bulgarian foreign ministry statement said this would reduce Russia's Sofia embassy staff \"to up to 23 diplomatic and 25 administrative and technical staff.\"\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

On Wednesday, he reproached NATO for not embracing or equipping his embattled country more fully.\n\n'The open-door policy of NATO shouldn't resemble old turnstiles on Kyiv's subway, which stay open but close when you approach them until you pay,' Mr Zelensky told NATO leaders meeting in Madrid, speaking by video link.\n\n'Hasn't Ukraine paid enough? Hasn't our contribution to defending Europe and the entire civilisation been sufficient?'\n\nHe asked for more modern artillery systems and other weapons and warned the NATO leaders they either had to provide Ukraine with the help it needed to defeat Russia or 'face a delayed war between Russia and yourself.'\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denied Moscow's forces were responsible for a strike on the crowded shopping centre.\n\n'Our army does not attack any civilian infrastructure site. We have every capability of knowing what is situated where,' Putin told a news conference in the Turkmenistan capital of Ashgabat.\n\n'Nobody among us shoots just like that, randomly. It is normally done based on intelligence data on targets' and with 'high-precision weapons'.\n\n'I am convinced that this time, everything was done in this exact manner,' Putin said.\n\nSince Putin ordered his forces into Ukraine, Moscow has insisted it has not targeted civilians, despite vast amounts of evidence on the contrary.\n\nRussian forces have bombed civilian sites indiscriminately, and there have been several instances where Ukrainians have been shot, tortured and raped.\n\nWar crime investigation into Russia's military actions are on-going.\n\nOnlookers gather as the shopping centre is engulfed by flames shortly after it was struck by two Russian guided missiles on Monday, while an estimated 1,000 people were inside\n\nSmoke rises from the ruins of the Amstor shopping mall in the city of Kremenchuk, central Ukraine, after it was struck by long-range guided missiles that Ukraine says were fired by Russian bombers\n\nOn Tuesday, the Russian military first claimed it struck a weapons depot in central Ukraine the previous day and the resulting explosions hit a closed shopping mall.\n\nThe strike hit 'a depot with weapons and ammunition from the USA and European countries in the vicinity of the Kremenchuk automobile factory', the Russian military said in a statement.\n\n'The explosions of ammunition for Western weapons sparked a fire in the nearby shopping mall, which was not operational at the time.'\n\nThe Kremlin backed the Russian military's statement, saying the defence ministry's explanations were 'exhaustive.'\n\n'I have nothing to add,' said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.\n\nRussia's defence ministry admitted being behind the attacks - despite one politician initially blaming Ukraine for bombing its own people - saying the factory was being used as a store for western weapons which were due to be transported to Donbas.\n\nIt denied striking the mall, and said the second missile actually hit a train station.\n\nBut Ukraine says Russia deliberately targeted the mall in a 'terrorist attack' designed to sow fear among civilians, and that there were no arms being stored at the factory - which manufactures parts for civilian vehicles, among other things.\n\nFootage from the complex tallies more closely with Kyiv's account than Russia's.\n\nFootage reveals the bomb was likely a Russian AS-4 'Kitchen' guided missile - a Soviet-era weapon that was originally designed to take out American aircraft carriers\n\nThe footage directly contradicts Kremlin claims that it destroyed a nearby factory being used to store weapons and a train station, and that the mall accidentally burned down after flames from those strikes spread\n\nThis is the moment a Russian missile slammed into a factory in the city of Kremechuk, central Ukraine, after another rocket blew apart a nearby shopping mall and killed at least 18 civilians\n\nCCTV captures panicked locals running for cover as smoke rises from the first blast (top right, behind the trees) before a second missile hits (top left) - sparking a huge fireball and shockwave\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, one of President Zelensky's top advisers who posted some of the footage online, wrote: 'Russian propaganda always lies: There is no coincidence, [the strike] was a deliberate blow to intimidate the population and cause mass casualties.'\n\nOn Wednesday, Pope Francis called the bombing of the crowded shopping centre the latest in string of 'barbarous attacks' against Ukraine.\n\n'Every day, I carry in my heart dear and martyred Ukraine, which continues to be flagellated by barbarous attacks like the one that hit the shopping centre in Kremenchuk,' Francis told crowds in St. Peter's Square on the feast of St. Peter and Paul.\n\n'I pray that this mad war can soon end and I renew my appeal to persevere without tiring in praying for peace.\n\n'May the Lord open the those paths to dialogue which men either do not want or not able to find.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky -- who is set to address Nato leaders -- tweeted that he had spoken to Stoltenberg in the run-up to stress \"the importance of a powerful missile defence system for Ukraine to prevent Russian terrorist attacks\".\n\nThat call came after a Russian missile strike on a mall in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk, which drew angry condemnation from Kyiv's Western backers.

Authorities said the number of victims had yet to be confirmed.\n\nSeparately, Zelenskiy said he had told NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg that his country needs missile defense systems to prevent Russian attacks.\n\nBritain's Ministry of Defense said in its daily intelligence bulletin on June 28 that Ukrainian forces continued to consolidate their positions on higher ground in Lysychansk, after abandoning its twin city, Syevyerodonetsk, to the Russians.\n\nThe bulletin said Ukrainian forces continued to disrupt the Russians' command and control with successful strikes deep behind Russian lines.\n\nBritish intelligence assessed that Russian forces in the Donbas are increasingly \"hollowed out\" and their combat effectiveness has been degraded -- a situation that is \"probably unsustainable\" in the long term.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Kremenchuk strike, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of being the \"largest terrorist organization in the world\" in a video on Telegram.\n\n\"Everyone in the world should know that buying or transporting Russian oil, maintaining ties with Russian banks, paying taxes and duties to the Russian state is giving money to terrorists,\" he said.\n\nDespite mounting evidence to the contrary, Russia has claimed repeatedly that it is not targeting civilians in the unprovoked war it launched on Ukraine just over four months ago.\n\nLeaders of the G7 called the missile strike a war crime and vowed to hold Russian President Vladimir Putin accountable.\n\nKremenchuk, an industrial city of just over 200,000, lies on the Dnipro River in the region of Poltava and is the site of Ukraine's biggest oil refinery.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://gdb.rferl.org/10040000-0aff-0242-cc39-08da58e43925_cx0_cy19_cw98_w1200_r1.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.7803921568627451, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 18, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 28, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094391988", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "06:20:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T06:20:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T06:05:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "url": "https://bnr.bg/en/post/101668571/russian-missile-strike-on-a-crowded-mall-in-the-ukrainian-city-of-kremenchuk-kills-sixteen-people", "title": "Russian missile strike on a crowded mall in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk kills sixteen people", "body": "A Russian missile strike on a crowded mall in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk killed sixteen people and injured fifty nine.

It was part of unusually intense barrage of Russian fire across Ukraine, including in the capital of Kyiv, that renewed international attention as the war drags on.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G-7 summit in Germany, French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven leading industrialized democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\"\n\n\"Russia cannot and should not win,\" he said. He called Monday's attack on the mall \"a new war crime.\"\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian authorities claimed that the shopping center was not the target.\n\nHow to counter Russia and back Ukraine will also be the focus of a summit this week of the western NATO alliance, whose support has been critical to Kyiv's ability to fend off Moscow's larger and better equipped forces. Ukrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to hold off and even drive back Russia, which is pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern region of the Donbas.\n\nAs Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall that authorities said was struck when more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when an explosion knocked her down. When another blast came about 10 minutes later, she realized she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicenter with all of my strength,\" she said. Fighting back tears, she added: \"You have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said. Several of the bodies of those who didn't make it out in time are burned beyond recognition, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded. Another 21 people are still missing, Monastyrsky said.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theater, a train station, and a hospital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\"\n\nRocket attacks continued elsewhere in Ukraine, with authorities in the city of Dnipro reporting that workers at a diesel car repair shop were trapped in rubble after a strike from a cruise missile fired from the Black Sea, Ukrainian news agencies reported. The Ukrainian military managed to intercept and destroy other missiles fired at the city, the agencies said.\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the Kremenchuk attack.\n\nAs condemnation came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals. He said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognizing its control over territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire. Ukrainian authorities said that in addition to the direct hit on the mall, a factory was struck, but denied it housed weapons.\n\nKonashenkov also alleged that the mall was not in use, a false claim that witnesses contradicted.\n\nOne survivor, Oleksandr, a mall employee, told the AP from a hospital bed that the shopping center was packed with customers. He recalled stepping outside with a colleague for a cigarette when the air raid siren went off.\n\n\"There was a black tunnel, smoke, fire,\" he said. \"I started to crawl. I saw the sun up there, and my brain was telling me I need to save myself.\"\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity.\" She emphasized the need for all Ukrainians to remain alert and expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. A further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire came as the G-7 leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of a summit starting this week in Madrid, and an early signal of unity came Tuesday when Turkey agreed to lift its opposition to Sweden and Finland joining NATO.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine prompted the Nordic pair to abandon their long-held nonaligned status and apply to join NATO. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had blocked the move, insisting the Nordic pair change their stance on Kurdish rebel groups that Turkey considers terrorists.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the West that \"the more weapons are pumped into Ukraine, the longer the conflict will continue and the longer the agony of the Nazi regime backed by Western capitals will last.\"\n\nRussia has falsely called the war a campaign to \"de-Nazify\" Ukraine -- a country with a democratically elected Jewish president who wants closer ties with the West.\n\nIn a sinister message to NATO leaders, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where their summit will be held.\n\nIt also posted images and the coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin -- referring to them as \"decision-making centers supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app. That wording echoes Russian President Vladimir Putin's warnings that he could target such centers in response to what he has called Western aggression.\n\nIn other developments, the two fighting countries continued a sporadic series of prisoner exchanges. Ukraine exchanged 15 Russian prisoners-of-war for 16 Ukrainian soldiers and one civilian, the Ukrainian Pravda news outlet reported Tuesday.\n\nUkrainian Pravda also reported that in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, the mayor was detained Tuesday and occupying authorities seized his computer hard drive and documents after he had refused to cooperate with Russian-appointed local officials. Russia's Tass news agency confirmed the detention.\n\nMeanwhile, Bulgaria said Tuesday it was expelling 70 Russian diplomats designated \"a threat to national security,\" ordering them to leave within 5 days.\n\nA Bulgarian foreign ministry statement said this would reduce Russia's Sofia embassy staff \"to up to 23 diplomatic and 25 administrative and technical staff.\"", "source": {"uri": "arabnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/main-image/2022/06/28/3309226-307525844.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 15, "stanza_neu": 40, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 56, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094897665", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "13:22:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T13:22:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T12:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "url": "https://www.rferl.org/a/tajikistan-kholov-russia-extradition/31919610.html", "title": "Relatives Fear Tajik Activist Faces Torture, Prison At Home As Russia Considers Extradition", "body": "Death Toll Climbs In Russian Missile Attack As Fighting Rages In East\n\nThe death toll from a Russian missile strike that hit a crowded shopping center in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk has risen to at least 18 people, with at least 60 wounded, as fighting continues for control of Lysychansk, the last Ukrainian holdout in the eastern Luhansk region.\n\nRegional Governor Dmytro Lunyn announced the updated toll of the strike on June 28 on Telegram as rescue and cleanup operations in Kremenchuk continued overnight.\n\nLunyn said the mall was \"completely destroyed\" by the missile strike and that 36 people were still missing.

The head of the regional military administration, Serhiy Hayday, said Ukrainian forces still controlled Lysychansk but its loss was possible as Russia poured resources into the fight.\n\nBritain's Ministry of Defense said in its daily intelligence bulletin on June 28 that Ukrainian forces continued to consolidate their positions on higher ground in Lysychansk, after abandoning its twin city, Syevyerodonetsk, to the Russians.\n\nThe bulletin said Ukrainian forces continued to disrupt the Russians' command and control with successful strikes deep behind Russian lines.\n\nBritish intelligence assessed that Russian forces in the Donbas are increasingly \"hollowed out\" and their combat effectiveness has been degraded -- a situation that is \"probably unsustainable\" in the long term.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Kremenchuk strike, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of being the \"largest terrorist organization in the world\" in a video on Telegram.\n\n\"Everyone in the world should know that buying or transporting Russian oil, maintaining ties with Russian banks, paying taxes and duties to the Russian state is giving money to terrorists,\" he said.\n\nDespite mounting evidence to the contrary, Russia has claimed repeatedly that it is not targeting civilians in the unprovoked war it launched on Ukraine just over four months ago.\n\nLeaders of the G7 called the missile strike a war crime and vowed to hold Russian President Vladimir Putin accountable.\n\nKremenchuk, an industrial city of just over 200,000, lies on the Dnipro River in the region of Poltava and is the site of Ukraine's biggest oil refinery.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://gdb.rferl.org/080a0000-0a00-0242-68f7-08da58d92407_w1200_r1.png", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 6, "stanza_neu": 15, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 21, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7095214909", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "17:49:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T17:49:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T17:04:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "url": "https://www.nwitimes.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/macron-says-russia-cant-win-in-ukraine-after-strike-on-mall/article_da64efbf-c526-5ab6-b86e-08b26f6368cd.html", "title": "Macron says Russia can't win in Ukraine after strike on mall", "body": "A police officer writes a report as a man wounded by the Russian deadly rocket attack at a shopping centre tells her about the attack in a city hospital in Kremenchuk in Poltava region, Ukraine, Tuesday, June 28, 2022.\n\nBy FRANCESCA EBEL and YURAS KARMANAU - Associated Press\n\nKREMENCHUK, Ukraine (AP) -- France's president denounced Russia's fiery airstrike on a crowded shopping mall in Ukraine as a \"new war crime\" Tuesday and vowed the West's support for Kyiv would not waver, saying Moscow \"cannot and should not win\" the war.\n\nThe strike, which killed at least 18 people in the central city of Kremenchuk, came as leaders from the Group of Seven nations met in Europe. It was part of unusually intense barrage of Russian fire across Ukraine, including in the capital of Kyiv, that drew new attention to a war that some fear could fade from attention a s it drags on.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G-7 summit in Germany, French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven leading industrialized democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\n\"Russia cannot and should not win,\" he said. He called Monday's attack on the mall \"a new war crime.\"\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian authorities claimed that the shopping center was not the target.\n\nHow to counter Russia and back Ukraine will also be the focus of a summit this week of the western NATO alliance, whose support has been critical to Kyiv's ability to fend off Moscow's larger and better equipped forces. Ukrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to hold off and even drive back Russia, which is pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern region of the Donbas.\n\nAs Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall that authorities said was struck when more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when an explosion knocked her down. When another blast came about 10 minutes later, she realized she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicenter with all of my strength,\" she said. Fighting back tears, she added: \"You have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said. Several of the bodies of those who didn't make it out in time are burned beyond recognition and their identification could take days, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded. Another 21 people are still missing, Monastyrsky said.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theater, a train station, and a hospital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history,\" while the G-7 leaders said \"indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.\"\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the attack.\n\nAs condemnation of the strike came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals. He said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognizing its control over territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire. Ukrainian authorities said that in addition to the direct hit on the mall, a factory was struck, but denied it housed any weapons.\n\nKonashenkov also alleged that the mall was not in use, a false claim that witnesses contradicted.\n\nOne survivor, Oleksandr, a mall employee, told the AP from a hospital bed that the shopping center was packed with customers. He recalled stepping outside with a colleague for a cigarette when the air raid siren went off.\n\n\"There was a black tunnel, smoke, fire,\" he said. \"I started to crawl. I saw the sun up there, and my brain was telling me I need to save myself.\"\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity,\" noting that Moscow's military has been \"systematically shelling civilian infrastructure with the aim to scare people, to kill people, to bring terror to our cities and villages.\"\n\nVenediktova emphasized the need for Ukrainians across the entire country to remain alert, adding that they should expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. A further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to local officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire in recent days came as the G-7 leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of a summit starting this week in Madrid as the alliance turns its attention once again to confronting an adversarial Russia.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the West that \"the more weapons are pumped into Ukraine, the longer the conflict will continue and the longer the agony of the Nazi regime backed by Western capitals will last.\"\n\nRussia has falsely called the war a campaign to \"de-Nazify\" Ukraine -- a country with a democratically elected Jewish president who wants closer ties with the West.\n\nIn a sinister message to NATO leaders, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where their summit will be held.\n\nIt also posted images and the coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin -- referring to them as \"decision-making centers supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app. That wording echoes Russian President Vladimir Putin's warnings that he could target such centers in response to what he has called Western aggression.\n\nIn other developments, the two fighting countries continued a sporadic series of prisoner exchanges. Ukraine exchanged 15 Russian prisoners-of-war for 16 Ukrainian soldiers and one civilian, the Ukrainian Pravda news outlet reported Tuesday.\n\nUkrainian Pravda also reported that in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, the mayor was detained Tuesday. The news outlet said occupying authorities seized Igor Kolykhaiev's computer hard drive and documents after he had refused to cooperate with Russian-appointed local officials. Russia's Tass news agency confirmed the detention.\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

The US ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink said the world would \"hold the Kremlin accountable for its atrocities in Ukraine\".Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday urged world powers to do their utmost to help end Russia\u00b4s invasion by the end of the year, as G7 leaders planned new sanctions and vowed to support Kyiv \"as long as it takes\".US President Joe Biden and his peers from the Group of Seven rich nations, meeting in the Bavarian Alps, pledged to tighten the economic screws on Moscow over its February 24 invasion of its neighbour.\n\nThe leaders put on a show of unity over Ukraine, even as the fallout from the war intensifies with soaring energy and food prices driving up global inflation. \"We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,\" the G7 said in a statement on the summit\u00b4s second day.\n\nAddressing the gathering via video-link, Zelensky urged leaders to help end the war before winter sets in and conditions for his troops become tougher. He also pressed allies to \"intensify sanctions\" on Moscow.\n\nThe summit host, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, signalled the G7\u00b4s readiness to do more, saying: \"We will continue to increase pressure on (Vladimir) Putin. This war has to come to an end.\"\n\nAmong the additional steps being discussed by G7 leaders is a price cap on Russian oil imports and sanctions targeting Russia\u00b4s defence sector.The United States is planning to send Ukraine sophisticated anti-aircraft missiles to defend against Russian attacks, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Monday.\"I can confirm that we are in fact, in the process of finalising a package that includes advanced air defence capabilities,\" Sullivan told reporters in Germany, where President Joe Biden was attending the G7 summit.\n\nSullivan said Biden had told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- who joined the G7 talks by video link -- that the United States was preparing shipment of \"advanced medium- and long-range air defence capabilities.\"\n\nSullivan said additional aid being prepared due to \"urgent need\" also included artillery ammunition and counter-battery radar systems, which are used to pinpoint the source of enemy artillery firing.", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 9, "stanza_neu": 20, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 29, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093686697", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "15:16:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T15:16:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T15:11:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "url": "https://www.expressandstar.com/news/world-news/2022/06/27/scores-feared-dead-after-russian-rocket-hits-ukrainian-shopping-centre/", "title": "Scores feared dead after Russian rocket hits Ukrainian shopping centre", "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said more than 1,000 civilians were inside at the time of the attack in Kremenchuk.\n\nScores of civilians are feared killed or injured after a Russian rocket strike hit a crowded shopping centre in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk, officials said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Telegram post that the number of victims was \"unimaginable\", citing reports that more than 1,000 civilians were inside at the time of the attack.\n\nMinutes later, Kyryl Tymoshenko, deputy head of the presidential office, said in a Telegram post that at least two were dead and about 20 were hurt, with nine in serious condition.\n\nMr Zelenskyy said the target presented \"no threat to the Russian army\" and had \"no strategic value\".\n\nHe accused of Russia of sabotaging \"people's attempts to live a normal life, which make the occupiers so angry\".", "source": {"uri": "expressandstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express & Star"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.expressandstar.com/resizer/l-EaCG1E2AHpaTPpMeZkHMrXjws=/1200x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/mna/DFXYFESYGVA5JJ2UJLR5S7KDRE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.6549019607843137, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 6, "stanza_neu": 2, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 8, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7095414916", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "21:36:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T21:36:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T21:15:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "url": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/2022/06/28/breaking-news/macron-says-russia-cant-win-in-ukraine-after-airstrike-on-mall/", "title": "Macron says Russia can't win in Ukraine after airstrike on mall", "body": "KREMENCHUK, Ukraine >> France's president denounced Russia's fiery airstrike on a crowded shopping mall in Ukraine as a \"new war crime\" today and vowed the West's support for Kyiv would not waver, saying Moscow \"cannot and should not win\" the war.\n\nThe strike, which killed at least 18 people in the central city of Kremenchuk, came as leaders from the Group of Seven nations met in Europe. It was part of an unusually intense barrage of Russian fire across Ukraine, including in the capital of Kyiv, that renewed international attention as the war drags on.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G-7 summit in Germany, French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven leading industrialized democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\"\n\n\"Russia cannot and should not win,\" he said. He called Monday's attack on the mall \"a new war crime.\"\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian authorities claimed that the shopping center was not the target.\n\nHow to counter Russia and back Ukraine will also be the focus of a summit this week of the western NATO alliance, whose support has been critical to Kyiv's ability to fend off Moscow's larger and better-equipped forces. Ukrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to hold off and even drive back Russia, which is pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern region of the Donbas.\n\nAs Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall that authorities said was struck when more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when an explosion knocked her down. When another blast came about 10 minutes later, she realized she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicenter with all of my strength,\" she said. Fighting back tears, she added: \"You have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said. Several of the bodies of those who didn't make it out in time are burned beyond recognition, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded. Another 21 people are still missing, Monastyrsky said.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theater, a train station, and a hospital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\"\n\nRocket attacks continued elsewhere in Ukraine, with authorities in the city of Dnipro reporting that workers at a diesel car repair shop were trapped in rubble after a strike from a cruise missile fired from the Black Sea, Ukrainian news agencies reported. The Ukrainian military managed to intercept and destroy other missiles fired at the city, the agencies said.\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York today to discuss the Kremenchuk attack.\n\nAs condemnation came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals. He said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognizing its control over territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire. Ukrainian authorities said that in addition to the direct hit on the mall, a factory was struck, but denied it housed weapons.\n\nKonashenkov also alleged that the mall was not in use, a false claim that witnesses contradicted.\n\nOne survivor, Oleksandr, a mall employee, told the AP from a hospital bed that the shopping center was packed with customers. He recalled stepping outside with a colleague for a cigarette when the air raid siren went off.\n\n\"There was a black tunnel, smoke, fire,\" he said. \"I started to crawl. I saw the sun up there, and my brain was telling me I need to save myself.\"\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity.\" She emphasized the need for all Ukrainians to remain alert and expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nRussian forces today struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. A further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire came as the G-7 leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of a summit starting this week in Madrid, and an early signal of unity came today when Turkey agreed to lift its opposition to Sweden and Finland joining NATO.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine prompted the Nordic pair to abandon their long-held nonaligned status and apply to join NATO. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had blocked the move, insisting the Nordic pair change their stance on Kurdish rebel groups that Turkey considers terrorists.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the West that \"the more weapons are pumped into Ukraine, the longer the conflict will continue and the longer the agony of the Nazi regime backed by Western capitals will last.\"\n\nRussia has falsely called the war a campaign to \"de-Nazify\" Ukraine -- a country with a democratically elected Jewish president who wants closer ties with the West.\n\nIn a sinister message to NATO leaders, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where their summit will be held.\n\nIt also posted images and the coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin -- referring to them as \"decision-making centers supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app. That wording echoes Russian President Vladimir Putin's warnings that he could target such centers in response to what he has called Western aggression.\n\nIn other developments, the two fighting countries continued a sporadic series of prisoner exchanges. Ukraine exchanged 15 Russian prisoners-of-war for 16 Ukrainian soldiers and one civilian, the Ukrainian Pravda news outlet reported today.\n\nUkrainian Pravda also reported that in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, the mayor was detained today and occupying authorities seized his computer hard drive and documents after he had refused to cooperate with Russian-appointed local officials. Russia's Tass news agency confirmed the detention.\n\nMeanwhile, Bulgaria said today it was expelling 70 Russian diplomats designated \"a threat to national security,\" ordering them to leave within 5 days.\n\nA Bulgarian foreign ministry statement said this would reduce Russia's Sofia embassy staff \"to up to 23 diplomatic and 25 administrative and technical staff.\"", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/site-images/sa-fb-thumb.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 15, "stanza_neu": 40, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 57, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094190708", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "01:40:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T01:40:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T01:39:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "url": "https://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/appalling-attack-kills-at-least-10-as-russian-strike-destroys-shopping-centre-crowded-with-civilians-41796824.html", "title": "'Appalling' attack kills at least 10 as Russian strike destroys shopping centre crowded with civilians", "body": "A Russian missile destroyed a crowded shopping mall in central Ukraine yesterday, continuing Vladimir Putin's attacks on civilians living far behind the front line.\n\nThe strike appears to form part of an aggressive new Russian strategy.\n\nOver the past three days its missiles have hit several civilian sites lying hundreds of miles from Ukraine's main battlegrounds, including an apartment block in Kyiv.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, said that there were \"a thousand people\" in the Amstor shopping mall in Kremenchuk, when the missile struck in the middle of the afternoon.\n\n\"The mall is on fire, firefighters are trying to extinguish the fire, the number of victims is impossible to imagine,\" he said.\n\nVideos on Twitter showed flames and black smoke billowing out of the shopping mall and civilians helping overwhelmed emergency crews load people into ambulances.\n\nA fire engine donated by Humberside Fire and Rescue in England doused the flames.\n\nIn one video, shot from inside the shopping mall, a man steps over broken glass and rubble to escape a smoke-filled room.

While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has denounced the attack and described its Russian perpetrators as \"terrorists,\" it is unfortunately but the latest in a series of strikes that have taken place in recent days across the country, many of which have also struck civilian facilities and locations.\n\nWhat Happened in the Attack?\n\nAccording to video evidence of the attack, the Russian strike on Kremenchuk occurred in broad daylight, when many civilian customers were present in the mall.\n\nAt the time of the attack, President Zelensky claimed that 1,000 people were inside the mall when it was attacked. 59 people were injured by the attack as well. Kremenchuk is far from the front lines in Donbas, and many shoppers there didn't think they had any reason to believe that they might be the target of a Russian missile strike so far from the front.\n\nThe city is located on the Dnieper River and is located in central Ukraine partway between the city of Dnipro and the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\nLocal and International Reactions\n\nIn addition to President Zelensky's reaction, the European Union and assembled G7 leaders condemned the Russian attack and the civilian casualties it incurred. The European Union's statement even went as far as to label the attack as a war crime.\n\nOfficial and unofficial reactions to the attack from Russian officials and media have been scattered and uncoordinated. Russia's Ministry of Defense officially denied having struck the mall directly, claiming that it was \"non-functioning\" and was instead damaged by explosions of ammunition dumps nearby which Russia had intended to hit.\n\nIn addition, Dmitry Polyanskiy the First Deputy Representative of Russia at the United Nations, claimed without proof that the attack was a Ukrainian provocation analogous to that of the massacre at Bucha and that the Ukrainian version of events was littered with \"discrepancies.\"\n\nHowever, such claims fall apart at even simple, cursory fact checks of the nature of the attack and how local accounts and online evidence strongly suggest that the mall remained in use right up until the attack.\n\nThe Kremenchuk Strike in Context\n\nAs Russia struggles to make incremental advances in Ukraine's Donbas, it has redoubled efforts to strike fixed targets across Ukraine to put pressure on Ukraine's people, government, and industry.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, two missiles fired from a Tu-22M3 bomber operating at standoff distance over Russia's Kursk Oblast were used in the strike. This is in keeping with what has emerged as Russia's preferred military strategy in its invasion of Ukraine where Russian bomber aircraft fire their missiles at targets located in Ukraine while themselves remaining in Russia for fear of Ukrainian air defenses.\n\nUkrainian authorities believe that Kh-22 missiles were used in the attack on Kremenchuk. Earlier in June, British Defense officials cautioned that Russia was increasingly beginning to lean on large, Soviet-era missiles such as the Kh-22 to strike targets in Ukraine. They also warned that using anti-ship missiles like the Kh-22 sharply raised the risk of civilian casualties and collateral damage, as they are poor-suited for ground-attack missions.\n\nOn June 7, Russian President Vladimir Putin hinted that Russian rocket attacks could pick up in tempo, threatening that the Russian military would strike \"objects that we haven't yet struck.\" Kyiv became a frequent target of Russian cruise missile strikes thereafter, with dozens of missiles hitting targets all over the city (including a deadly apartment building attack) as recently as June 26. In a tweet, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba claimed that the attacks were intended to be a signal to the G7 countries ahead of their meeting in Germany, which began on June 26.\n\nWhile it is impossible to ascertain with 100% certainty the motives behind Russia's slew of attack missile attacks on Ukraine, it appears that the Kremlin hopes to break the fighting capability of Ukraine, and is willing to fight dirty or carelessly to do so.\n\nAs it struggles to gain ground in Donbas, Russian forces have instead turned to strikes on targets far from the battlefields of Donbas in an effort to put pressure on the willingness and capability of the Ukrainian people to continue their opposition to Russia's invasion.", "source": {"uri": "19fortyfive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "19FortyFive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "wesley_culp@19fortyfive.com", "name": "Wesley Culp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.19fortyfive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Russian-Tank-1024x576.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 17, "stanza_neu": 10, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 27, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093836638", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "17:29:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T17:29:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T15:34:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "url": "https://www.ansa.it/nuova_europa/en/news/sections/news/2022/06/27/missile-strike-on-mall-in-east-ukraine-kills-at-least-2_e20a8083-a422-4169-b0af-1859f792885f.html", "title": "Missile strike on mall in east Ukraine kills at least 2 - News - Nuova Europa", "body": "(ANSA-AFP) - KYIV, JUN 27 - A Russian missile strike on Monday hit a crowded mall in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said, killing at least two and injuring dozens more. \"The occupiers fired missiles at a shopping centre where there were over a thousand civilians.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\" The G-7 leaders said \"indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.\"\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the attack.\n\nStriking a defiant note, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals, noting that the hostilities could end \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to meet the Russian demands and orders its troops to surrender.\n\nby signing up you agree to our terms of service\n\nThe Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine recognize Russia's sovereignty over Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, acknowledge the independence of Moscow-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, and recognize the current situation, an apparent reference gains Russia has made since the start of the war.\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian authorities claimed that the mall was not the target. Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot containing Western weapons and ammunition, causing powerful blasts that set the mall on fire.\n\nUkrainian officials have directly contradicted that, saying the mall itself was hit in the strike. Wayne Jordash, a British lawyer who is working with Ukrainian officials to investigate possible war crimes, meanwhile. said that initial indications were that there were no military targets nearby, but the investigation is ongoing. He did say a factory nearby was also hit.\n\nKonashenkov also alleged that the mall was not in use, a false claim contradicted by witnesses.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when there was an explosion. The blast knocked her down. When another came about 10 minutes later, she realized she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicenter with all of my strength,\" she said. \"It was terrifying.\"\n\nFighting back tears, she said that \"you have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nThe regional governor, Dmytro Lunin, said at least 18 people were killed in the attack and 59 others sought medical assistance, of whom 25 were hospitalized. The region declared a day of mourning Tuesday for the victims of the attack.\n\nUkrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said after visiting the scene that many bodies were burned beyond recognition and their identification could take days, adding that 21 people were considered missing.\n\nMonastyrsky noted that most of up to 1,000 people who were in the mall when an air raid siren sounded quickly moved to a shelter across the road.\n\n\"Unfortunately, those people who stayed during the air alarm died only because they remained there,\" he added, urging both businesses and customers to adhere to safety protocols and quickly get to safety after an attack warning.\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity,\" noting that Moscow's military has been \"systematically shelling civilian infrastructure with the aim to scare people, to kill people, to bring terror to our cities and villages.\"\n\nVenediktova emphasized the need for Ukrainians across the entire country to remain alert, adding that they should expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire in recent days came as the G-7 leaders gathered in Europe. They pledged continued support for Ukraine and the world's major economies prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nThe Russian strike echoed earlier attacks that caused large numbers of civilian casualties -- such as one in March on a Mariupol theater where many civilians had holed up, killing an estimated 600, and another in April on a train station in eastern Kramatorsk that killed at least 59 people.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv in the Mykolaiv region, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. A further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to local officials.\n\nRussia has increasingly used long-range bombers in the war. Ukrainian officials said Russian Tu-22M3 long-range bombers flying over Russia's western Kursk region fired the missiles, one of which hit the shopping center and another that struck a sports arena in Kremenchuk.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. The U.S. appeared ready to respond to that call, and NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of its summit this week.\n\nThe attack on Kremenchuk came as Russia was pressing an all-out assault on the last Ukrainian stronghold in eastern Luhansk province -- part of its campaign to wrest the eastern Donbas region from Ukraine.\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

The attack on Kremenchuk mall comes amid the war between Russia and Ukraine continues for more than 120 days.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Services press officer Svitlana Rybalko told The Associated Press that 18 people have been killed in the attack on Kremenchuk's shopping mall. Svitlana Rybalko further said that the investigators found fragments of eight more bodies and a number of survivors were undergoing treatment.

Parents scrambled to grab their children and take cover. Another missile would soon land nearby.\n\nSome 20 people were killed in the shopping centre on Monday, in what Kyiv has described as a targeted attack on a shopping mall with 1,000 civilians inside.\n\nMoscow claimed that no missiles hit the mall. However, newly released footage has shown a long-range anti-ship missile landing on the Amstor shopping mall before another missile struck an industrial site just a kilometre away.\n\nThe latest CCTV video, released by Volodymyr Zelensky late on Tuesday, gave the clearest evidence yet of a direct hit on the mall.\n\nIn a short clip time-coded at 3.51pm, a missile can be seen soaring through the air over what appears to be the mall for a split second before a fiery explosion lights up the landscape and throws debris into the air.\n\nThe Ukrainian president said the video proved that Russia knew what it was targeting and accused the Kremlin of trying to \"kill as many people as possible\".\n\nEarlier that day, he addressed the UN Security Council, calling on world leaders to punish Russia.\n\n\"The person who carried out this strike knew for sure that he was aiming a missile at an ordinary shopping centre,\" Mr Zelensky said, denying Russia's claim that the mall, in the city of Kremenchuk, was not in use.\n\nUkraine's air force command said that the shopping mall was hit by Russian Kh-22 missiles fired from Tu-22M3 bombers that flew from Shaykovka airfield in Russia's Kaluga region, 190 miles southwest of Moscow.\n\nPavel Luzin, an independent Russian defence expert, told The Telegraph that both the blast impact he saw in photos and videos from the scene, and a screengrab of the missile in the air from CCTV video, appeared to show that the mall was struck by the Kh-22, a long-range anti-ship missile designed in the Soviet Union.\n\nRussian state media on Monday spent hours spinning theories about the mall bombing, accusing Ukrainians of faking the attack.\n\nRussia's defence ministry, however, soon claimed responsibility for striking Kremenchuk but insisted that the mall caught fire after a missile hit a warehouse with Western-donated weapons.\n\nIgor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the Russian military, said on Tuesday that Russia used \"high-precision weapons\" to target hangers at a local factory storing fresh ammunition and weapons that were bound to be sent to eastern Ukraine, the epicentre of the war's heaviest fighting.\n\n\"Ammunition for Western weaponry stored at the warehouse denoted, causing a fire at a shopping centre nearby that has not been operational,\" he said.\n\nBellingcat, a forensic investigation group, debunked Moscow's claim that the mall went ablaze after the ammunition stored nearby at the Kremenchuk road machinery plant blew up.\n\nDrone footage of the destroyed mall clearly showed its central section completely destroyed with the roof of the mall flattened - damage consistent with a missile strike.\n\nSatellite images from the area published by Bellingcat appeared to show little noticeable damage in the area between the mall and the industrial site about a kilometre away that was hit by a second attack.\n\nSeveral CCTV clips from the area published by local media back the suggestion that the mall was hit first before a second missile hit the Kremenchuk road machinery plant.\n\nIn one of the most stunning videos from Kremenchuk, residents were seen in what appeared to be a few minutes between the first and the second explosion.\n\nA CCTV video from the Misky park close to the factory showed a parent hurrying to hide behind the tree as clouds of grey smoke are rising from the direction of the Amstor mall.\n\nA second later, a powerful blast close to the camera shook the park, sending debris raining into the pond and on the ground.\n\nAnother video showed a couple running across the lawn from what would soon be the epicentre of the explosion before the man rolled on the ground and leapt into the water.\n\nThe footage appeared to show the hit on the factory time-coded at 3.59pm, or eight minutes after the CCTV video showing a missile striking the shopping mall.\n\nIn the past four months of the war, Russian forces have destroyed a great number of civilian infrastructure often situated near industrial sites, leading military experts to believe that Russia may be running low on high-precision weapons.\n\nIn a daily briefing on Wednesday, the UK's Ministry of Defence suggested that the Russian forces in Kremenchuk were possibly aiming for the plant nearby.\n\n\"Russia's inaccuracy in conducting long-range strikes has previously resulted in mass civilian casualty incidents, including at Kramatorsk railway station on 9 April 2022,\" the briefing said.\n\n\"Russia's shortage of more modern precision-strike weapons and the professional shortcomings of their targeting planners will highly likely result in further civilian casualties.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nataliya_vasilyeva@telegraph.co.uk",

Ukrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to continue to hold off and even drive back Russia, which is pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern region of the Donbas.\n\nAs Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall that authorities said was struck when more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when there was an explosion. The blast knocked her down. When another came about 10 minutes later, she realized she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicenter with all of my strength,\" she said. Fighting back tears, she added: \"You have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said. Several of the bodies of those who didn't make it out in time are burned beyond recognition and their identification could take days, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded. Another 21 people are still missing, Monastyrsky said.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theater, a train station, and a hospital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history,\" while the G-7 leaders said \"indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.\"\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the attack.\n\nAs condemnation of the strike came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals. He said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognizing its control over territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire. Ukrainian officials have contradicted that, saying the mall was hit directly.\n\nKonashenkov said the depot was near a factory for road construction equipment. Mykola Danileiko, a spokesman for that factory, confirmed that it was hit along with the mall, but insisted that there were no weapons there. Wayne Jordash, a British lawyer who is working with Ukrainian officials to investigate possible war crimes, meanwhile, said that initial indications were that there were no military targets nearby, but the investigation is ongoing.\n\nKonashenkov also alleged that the mall was not in use, a false claim contradicted by witnesses.\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity,\" noting that Moscow's military has been \"systematically shelling civilian infrastructure with the aim to scare people, to kill people, to bring terror to our cities and villages.\"\n\nVenediktova emphasized the need for Ukrainians across the entire country to remain alert, adding that they should expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. A further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to local officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire in recent days came as the G-7 leaders gathered in Europe. They pledged continued support for Ukraine and the world's major economies prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. The U.S. appeared ready to respond to that call, and NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of its summit as the alliance turns its attention once again to confronting an adversarial Russia.\n\nIn a sinister warning as NATO leaders gathered in Madrid ahead of that summit, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where the meeting will be held.\n\nIt also posted the images and coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin -- referring to them as \"decision-making centers supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app. That wording echoes Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier warnings that he could target such centers in response to what he has called aggressive Western actions.\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

Ukrainian authorities said the missiles were long-range X-22s launched by Tu-22M3 bomber jets from the skies over Russia's Kursk region.\n\nDmytro Lunin, governor of the region that includes Kremenchuk, wrote on Telegram that 18 people were confirmed dead from the attack. He said the figure is expected to rise as rescuers continue to clear the rubble. So far 59 people have been counted among the wounded.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cited reports that more than 1,000 people were in the mall at the time of the strike and said, \"It is impossible to even imagine the number of victims.\"\n\nVideos from the scene showed thick plumes of smoke rising from burning buildings, as emergency crews worked to rescue survivors and locate bodies.\n\nZelenskyy said the mall posed \"no threat to the Russian Army\" and had \"no strategic value\" as a target. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin was targeting \"people's attempts to live a normal life, which make the occupiers so angry.\"\n\nThe shopping mall strike comes as Russia has stepped up missile strikes across Ukraine in recent days, likely to coincide with the G-7 summit, during which the United States and its partners are planning further support of Ukraine.\n\nThe attack is reminiscent of Russian strikes earlier this year that killed numerous Ukrainian civilians, such as the Bucha massacre that killed at least 280, the assault on a Mariupol theater that killed some 600 mostly women and children, and the targeting of a train station in Kramatorsk that killed more than 50 civilians as they tried to flee the area. There was also a March 17 attack on Kharkiv's Barbashovo market and a missile strike on Kyiv's Retroville mall three days later that killed eight people.\n\nRussia's hit list since the full-scale war began on February 24 has also included numerous schools, hospitals, libraries, stadiums and vast residential areas. \"It's a pattern we've seen at work for months now,\" Kyiv-based analyst Taras Revunets told the Trumpet on June 28. \"Russia's repeated attacks on residential areas in my country certainly do meet my definition of terrorism.\"\n\nZelenskyy agrees with this view. \"Russia continues to take out its impotence on ordinary civilians,\" he said on June 27, adding that it is \"useless to hope for decency and humanity on its part.\" Zelenskyy called the strike on the Kremenchuk mall \"one of the most daring terrorist acts in European history.\"\n\nThe president said: \"Peaceful city, ordinary shopping center, women inside, children, ordinary civilians. This is not a mistaken hit of missiles. This is a planned Russian strike at this shopping center.\"\n\nRussia's intentional and repeated targeting of civilians is wicked beyond words and means the nation deserves to be designated as a terrorist entity. It is unsettling to talk or even think about these occurrences, and many in America have become fatigued by the news of Russia's war on Ukraine. But the Bible admonishes us not to turn our faces away from this sort of evil. Isaiah 33:18 says our hearts must \"meditate terror.\"\n\nTrumpet editor in chief Gerald Flurry commented on this passage during a 2013 lecture, stating: \"[W]e we can't just shut it out of our minds and go watch television or read a book or go see some sporting event or whatever if it's used to escape this. God says, I want you to think about it, and I want you to understand it, and I want you to proclaim it to this world! ... He says you'd better meditate on it. You'd better see how bad it really is.\"\n\nAs much as we would prefer to escape into some form of entertainment and avoid contemplating Russia's war of aggression, the civilians being slaughtered, and the hundreds of thousands being deported to Russia, we need to meditate on these atrocities. We need to think about the evil and suffering of this world and consider its causes -- and consider our lives.\n\nBut at the same time, we must also meditate on the Bible's detailed promises of a new world -- a world of lasting peace and prosperity -- that is coming soon.\n\nTo better understand the need to think deeply about the atrocities in Ukraine, and to learn about the profound hope that is connected to these developments, read \"Why You Need to See the Horror in Ukraine\" and Mr. Flurry's free booklet The Prophesied 'Prince of Russia.'", "source": {"uri": "thetrumpet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Trumpet"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.thetrumpet.com/files/W1siZiIsIjIwMjIvMDYvMjgvMjFlMmptYzNzYV8yMDIyMDYyOF9Cb21iaW5nX0dldHR5SW1hZ2VzXzEyNDE1ODQyODAuanBnIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIxMDI0eCJdLFsicCIsImVuY29kZSIsImpwZyIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgwIl1d/fb854e01bae7548e/20220628-Bombing-GettyImages-1241584280.jpg.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 24, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 36, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094836195", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "12:34:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T12:34:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T12:33:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6039215922355652, "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-shopping-mall-russia-missile-strike-deaths-zelenskyy-terrorist-attack/", "title": "Ukraine Deaths mount as Ukraine calls Russian mall strike a \"terrorist attack\"", "body": "Kremenchuk, Ukraine -- Ukrainian emergency services personnel were still searching through the rubble on Tuesday of a shopping mall hit by a Russian missile strike, hoping to find any survivors as the death toll climbed to 18.

He called it part of \"the biggest overhaul of our collective deterrence and defense since the Cold War.\"\n\nNine NATO allies now reach or exceed the alliance's target of spending 2% of GDP on defense, while 19 have clear plans to reach it by 2024, he said. Five other allies have concrete commitments to meet it after the 2024 goal, he said.\n\nBy the end of this year, NATO allies will have invested \"well over\" $350 billion extra since the alliance agreed to its defense investment pledge in 2014.\n\nZelenskiy Wants Fighting Over by End of This Year (12:22 p.m.)\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy joined the G-7 summit by video link from Kyiv and said he wants the war to be over by the end of the year, according to officials familiar with his remarks.\n\nHe addressed each of the leaders individually with a specific comment, according to the officials, who asked not to be identified by name.\n\nHe requested support on flight defense systems, security and financing for reconstruction, as well as help on unblocking exports of the country's grain.\n\nPutin to Leave Russia for First Time Since Ukraine Invasion (12:10 p.m.)\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin will travel to Tajikistan on Tuesday and later visit Turkmenistan for a summit of Caspian Sea nations, his spokesman said, in the first foreign trip by the Russian leader since the invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nUkraine Seeks to Boost Passage of Goods Via Danube Ports (11:19 a.m.)\n\nUkraine wants to increase the volume of goods passing through the three operational ports on the Danube River under its control to 1.5 million tons in June, Deputy Head of the Seaports Administration Dmytro Barinov said in a video briefing.\n\nThis would still be less than one-third of the pre-war volume, he said. Further increases of throughput won't be reached by merely improving logistics as new infrastructure will have to be built, he said.\n\nUkrainian ports on the Danube River were unprepared to handle the increased amount of cargo after Russia invaded, he said. About 70 foreign vessels still remain in Ukrainian ports blocked by Russia, some of them have crews on board.\n\nEU Needs Alternatives to Russian Gas, Breton Says (11:01 a.m.)\n\nThe European Union needs to find alternatives to Russian natural gas as fast as possible because President Putin is cutting supply, Thierry Breton, the region's internal markets commissioner, said in a French radio interview.\n\nBreton urged European utilities to prolong the lifespans of nuclear reactors, citing in particular French company Engie SA which operates plants in Belgium. Coal plants will also have to be revived along with a \"massive acceleration\" in rolling out renewable energy projects like offshore wind farms, he said.\n\nG-7 to Explore Russian Oil-Price Cap (10:05 a.m.)\n\nThe G-7 is expected to reach an agreement for member states to develop and discuss ways to set a cap on the price of Russian oil, according to a senior Biden administration official. The group plans to direct relevant ministers to work with other governments and private-sector companies to come up with a mechanism that focuses on transportation of Russian oil to foreign markets.\n\nRight now it remains an idea, and the discussion will center around its viability. The discussion will happen over the coming days and weeks and there is no set date to establish a cap, the official said.\n\nUS Providing Anti-Air Defense System to Ukraine (8:03 a.m.)\n\nUS President Joe Biden is set to announce the purchase of an advanced surface-to-air missile system for Ukraine.\n\nNASAMS are an advanced medium to long range surface-to-air missile defense system. Ukraine is suffering from missile attacks and can only strike down a fraction of incoming missiles. The problem remains how quickly Kyiv can get them, how many will come and how long will it take to train people to use them.\n\nIt's the same system the US uses to protect the airspace around the White House and US Capitol in Washington.\n\nJapan to Ban Imports of Russian Gold (7:34 a.m.)\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida told his G-7 counterparts he planned to impose extra sanctions on Moscow that include banning the import of Russian gold. Japan will also ban the provision of services like accounting and freeze the assets of an additional 70 individuals, a government spokesman told reporters in Munich.\n\nSpot gold rose 0.5% to $1,835.99 an ounce as of 6:20 a.m. in London on Monday.

EU energy ministers will discuss risk preparedness at a meeting on Monday in Luxembourg, according to diplomats.\n\nRead more: EU Confronts Risks of Low Gas Storage in Test of Unity on Russia\n\nCrude Oil Fluctuates as Traders Monitor G-7 (4:06 a.m.)\n\nOil fluctuated near $107 a barrel as investors monitored developments from the gathering of G-7 leaders, while fears of a demand-sapping recession continued to hang over the market.\n\nOil is heading for its first monthly decline since November on escalating fears about a global slowdown as central banks hike interest rates to combat surging inflation. Retail prices for products like gasoline haven't fallen anywhere near as fast as crude, however, due to a shortage of capacity to make fuels.\n\nBan on New Gold Imports Seen as 'Largely Symbolic' (4:04 a.m.)\n\nThe plan by some G-7 nations to ban new gold imports from Russia is \"largely symbolic\" as flows have already been restricted by sanctions, according to analysts.\n\nWhile the UK government said in a statement over the weekend that \"this measure will have global reach, shutting the commodity out of formal international markets,\" analysts played down the potential impact as the London Bullion Market Association, which sets standards for that market, removed Russian gold refiners from its accredited list in March.\n\nRead more: Ban on New Gold Imports From Russia Seen as 'Largely Symbolic'\n\nRussia Defaults on Foreign Debt (1:01 a.m.)\n\nFor months, Russia found paths around the penalties imposed after the Kremlin's invasion of its neighbor. But at the end of the day on Sunday, the grace period on about $100 million of snared interest payments due May 27 expired, a deadline considered an event of default if missed.\n\nThe move is a grim marker in the country's rapid transformation into an economic, financial and political outcast. The nation's euro bonds have traded at distressed levels since the start of March, the central bank's foreign reserves remain frozen, and the biggest banks are severed from the global financial system.\n\nThe last time Russia fell into default vis-a-vis its foreign creditors was more than a century ago, when the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin repudiated the nation's staggering Czarist-era debt load in 1918.\n\nRead more: Russia Defaults on Foreign Debt for First Time Since 1918", "source": {"uri": "news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/i0acQzsl2PX6wohQSmwfZA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tLsbSdtKVHJjMktV6UG6Uw--~B/aD04NDQ7dz0xMjk2O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/77a18e4a1f1d90a7e7c3a3239b09166f", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 30, "stanza_neu": 66, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 98, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093726966", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "15:50:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T15:50:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T15:49:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "url": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/ukraine-russia-strikes-shopping-mall-dozens-feared-dead/", "title": "Ukraine: Russia strikes shopping mall, dozens feared dead", "body": "SLOVIANSK, Ukraine -- Scores of civilians are feared killed or injured after a Russian rocket strike hit a crowded shopping mall in Ukraine's central city of Kremenchuk, Ukrainian officials say.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says in a Telegram post that the number of victims was \"unimaginable,\" citing reports that more than 1,000 civilians were inside at the time of the attack.\n\nKyryl Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the presidential office, says in a Telegram post that at least two people were confirmed dead and about 20 hurt, of whom at least nine are in serious condition.\n\nZelensky stresses that the target presented \"no threat to the Russian army\" and had \"no strategic value.\" He accuses Russia of sabotaging \"people's attempts to live a normal life, which make the occupiers so angry.\"\n\n\"Russia continues to take out its impotence on ordinary civilians.

Ukrainian prosecutors said they also found the remains of six more people.\n\nUkraine's interior minister, Denys Monastyrskiy, said in a briefing that 21 people were still missing, adding that some of the missing people could be amongst the bodies that have been found.\n\nAuthorities estimate there were between 200 and 1,000 people inside the mall. Many managed to flee to a nearby bomb shelter when they heard an air raid siren.\n\n\"I left the building two minutes before the explosion,\" said Yevhenia Semyonova, 38, a shop assistant at a sportswear store in the mall. \"My colleagues who are working in bigger stores, like the supermarket for example, had to wait for the customers to get out before they could leave. We were lucky because there were no customers in our story during the alarm.\"\n\nIn a joint statement, the leaders of the G7 condemned the \"abominable attack\" and noted that strikes aimed at civilians were a war crime, and they pledged \"unwavering support\" for Ukraine.\n\n\"We stand united with Ukraine in mourning the innocent victims of this brutal attack. Indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime. [Vladimir] Putin and those responsible will be held to account,\" the statement said. \"We will not rest until Russia ends its cruel and senseless war on Ukraine.\"\n\nSeparately, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, called the attack an \"abomination\". He said: \"We share the pain of the victims' families, and the anger in the face of such an atrocity. The Russian people have to see the truth.\"\n\nA UN spokesperson, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, said: \"It is deplorable, to say the least. Any sort of civilian infrastructure, which includes obviously shopping malls, and civilians should never ever be targeted.\"\n\nRussia's ministry of defence said on Tuesday morning that the fire was caused by \"the detonation of stored ammunition for western weapons\" located next to the mall, which Moscow claimed \"wasn't operating\".\n\nThe ministry said it conducted a \"high-precision\" strike on a hangar in Kremenchuk containing weapons supplied by US and European countries. No evidence was offered to back up the claims.\n\nDmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's spokeperson, told reporters on Tuesday that the war would only end when Ukraine capitulated to Moscow's demands. \"The Ukrainian side can end everything by the end of today. They just need to order Ukrainian troops to lay down their weapons and fulfil Russia's conditions. And it'll all be over,\" he said.\n\n\"An order for the nationalist units to lay down their arms is necessary.\"\n\nUkraine's air force command said Russia hit the mall, located near a railway station, with two X-22 cruise missiles that were fired by an unspecified number of Tu-22M long-range bombers.\n\nImages from the scene showed giant plumes of black smoke and flames, and emergency crews rushing in to search for victims. It took 300 emergency workers more than four hours to extinguish the flames.\n\nMykola Lukash, from the Kremenchuk district prosecutor's office, said cranes would be brought in on Tuesday to help lift the collapsed roof of the shopping centre. \"We haven't found any children's bodies. A lot of bodies are burnt. We need to carry out DNA tests,\" Lukash said.\n\nOn Monday night, emergency workers and soldiers combed through blackened debris and twisted metal. \"We pulled out several bodies, but there are definitely more trapped under the rubble,\" said Oleksii, 46, a firefighter. \"This is normally a very crowded place.\"\n\nSpeaking at 2am local time, Kruk, the emergency services chief, said work was continuing at the site. He added: \"The main tasks currently performed by rescuers are to carry out rescue operations, dismantle debris and eliminate fires. So far, 16 people have been killed and 59 injured, 25 of whom have been hospitalised.\"\n\nZelenskiy said on Telegram that the number of victims was \"unimaginable\". He wrote: \"The occupiers fired missiles at the shopping centre, where there were more than a thousand civilians. The mall is on fire, rescuers are extinguishing the fire, the number of victims is unimaginable. Russia continues to take out its impotence on ordinary citizens. It is useless to hope for decency and humanity from Russia.\"\n\nIn his nightly video address, Zelenskiy also called Russia \"the largest terrorist organisation in the world\".", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/e9hDQJ2ouyJSMmnDRnPidg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03MjA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0M5T4d9Re_vAk_wH45_pvA--~B/aD00MDMyO3c9NjcyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/afa1007a198bf858a59767c33452148f", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 16, "stanza_neu": 32, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 49, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7095189126", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "17:24:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T17:24:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T16:54:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "url": "https://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/russian-missile-strikes-mall-in-kremenchuck-unsc-meeting-to-convene-on-wednesday/", "title": "Russian missile strikes mall in Kremenchuck, UNSC meeting to convene on Wednesday - SABC News - Breaking news, special reports, world, business, sport coverage of all South African current events.

The Group of Seven leading economic powers are concluding their annual gathering on Tuesday. AP-Yonhap\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday that Russia ''cannot and should not win'' the war in Ukraine, a day after a Russian missile attack on a crowded shopping mall that killed 18 put the conflict's terrible toll on full view.\n\nUkrainian and Western leaders have denounced the strike as a war crime and a terrorist attack and it drew swift condemnation from the Group of Seven leaders meeting in Europe at the time. It came during an unusually intense barrage of Russian strikes all across Ukraine, including in the capital of Kyiv, that drew new attention to a war that some fear could fade from the headlines as it drags on.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G-7 summit in Germany, Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven industrialized democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia ''as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.''\n\n''Russia cannot and should not win,'' he said, adding that Monday's attack on the mall was ''a new war crime.''\n\nAs he spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall in Kremenchuk that authorities said was struck when more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theater, a train station, and a hospital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it ''one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.'' The G-7 leaders said ''indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.''\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the attack.\n\nStriking a defiant note, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals, noting that the hostilities could end ''before the end of the day'' if Ukraine were to meet the Russian demands and orders its troops to surrender.\n\nPeople watch as smoke bellows after a Russian missile strike hit a crowded shopping mall, in Kremenchuk, Ukraine, June 27, 2022. AP\n\nThe Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine recognize Russia's sovereignty over Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, acknowledge the independence of Moscow-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, and recognize the current situation, an apparent reference gains Russia has made since the start of the war.\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian authorities claimed that the mall was not the target. Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot containing Western weapons and ammunition, causing powerful blasts that set the mall on fire.\n\nUkrainian officials have directly contradicted that, saying the mall itself was hit in the strike. Wayne Jordash, a British lawyer who is working with Ukrainian officials to investigate possible war crimes, meanwhile. said that initial indications were that there were no military targets nearby, but the investigation is ongoing. He did say a factory nearby was also hit.\n\nKonashenkov also alleged that the mall was not in use, a false claim contradicted by witnesses.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when there was an explosion. The blast knocked her down. When another came about 10 minutes later, she realized she needed to get away.\n\n''I ran away from the epicenter with all of my strength,'' she said. ''It was terrifying.''\n\nFighting back tears, she said that ''you have to be a real monster'' to strike a shopping mall.\n\nThe regional governor, Dmytro Lunin, said at least 18 people were killed in the attack and 59 others sought medical assistance, of whom 25 were hospitalized. The region declared a day of mourning Tuesday for the victims of the attack.\n\nUkrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said after visiting the scene that many bodies were burned beyond recognition and their identification could take days, adding that 21 people were considered missing.\n\nMonastyrsky noted that most of up to 1,000 people who were in the mall when an air raid siren sounded quickly moved to a shelter across the road.\n\nGermany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz, U.S. President Joe Biden, Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Charles Michel, Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and France's President Emmanuel Macron sit at a round table as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addresses G7 leaders via video link during their working session at Elmau Castle, Germany, June 27, 2022. Reuters-Yonhap\n\n''Unfortunately, those people who stayed during the air alarm died only because they remained there,'' he added, urging both businesses and customers to adhere to safety protocols and quickly get to safety after an attack warning.\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's ''crimes against humanity,'' noting that Moscow's military has been ''systematically shelling civilian infrastructure with the aim to scare people, to kill people, to bring terror to our cities and villages.''\n\nVenediktova emphasized the need for Ukrainians across the entire country to remain alert, adding that they should expect a similar strike ''every minute.''\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire in recent days came as the G-7 leaders gathered in Europe. They pledged continued support for Ukraine and the world's major economies prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nThe Russian strike echoed earlier attacks that caused large numbers of civilian casualties _ such as one in March on a Mariupol theater where many civilians had holed up, killing an estimated 600, and another in April on a train station in eastern Kramatorsk that killed at least 59 people.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv in the Mykolaiv region, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. A further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to local officials.\n\nRussia has increasingly used long-range bombers in the war. Ukrainian officials said Russian Tu-22M3 long-range bombers flying over Russia's western Kursk region fired the missiles, one of which hit the shopping center and another that struck a sports arena in Kremenchuk.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. The U.S. appeared ready to respond to that call, and NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of its summit this week.\n\nThe attack on Kremenchuk came as Russia was pressing an all-out assault on the last Ukrainian stronghold in eastern Luhansk province _ part of its campaign to wrest the eastern Donbas region from Ukraine.

It was part of an unusually intense barrage of Russian fire across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv, that renewed international attention as the war drags on.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G-7 summit in Germany, French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven leading industrialized democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

He called Monday's attack on the mall \"a new war crime.\"\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian officials claimed the shopping center was not the target.\n\nIn a virtual address to the U.N. Security Council, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia has become a terrorist state and called for it to be expelled from the United Nations. He also urged the U.N. to establish an international tribunal to investigate Russia's action in Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy ended his address by asking all in the chamber to stand in silent tribute to the \"tens of thousands\" of Ukrainian children and adults killed in the war. All council members rose, including Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador Dmitry Polyansky.\n\nHow to counter Russia and back Ukraine will also be the focus of a summit this week of the NATO alliance, whose support has been critical to Kyiv's ability to fend off Moscow's larger and better equipped forces. Ukrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to hold off and even drive back Russia, which is pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.\n\nAs Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall, which officials said was struck when more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when an explosion knocked her down. When another blast came about 10 minutes later, she realized she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicenter with all of my strength,\" she said. Fighting back tears, she added: \"You have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said. Several of the bodies of those who didn't make it out in time are burned beyond recognition, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded, while 21 people were still missing.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theater, a train station, and a hospital. Zelenskyy called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\"\n\nRocket attacks continued elsewhere in Ukraine, with authorities in the city of Dnipro reporting that workers at a diesel car repair shop were trapped in rubble after a strike from a cruise missile fired from the Black Sea, Ukrainian news agencies reported. The Ukrainian military managed to intercept and destroy other missiles fired at the city, the agencies said.\n\nAs condemnation came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals. He said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognizing its control over territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire. Ukrainian authorities said that in addition to the direct hit on the mall, a factory was struck, but denied it housed weapons.\n\nKonashenkov also falsely alleged that the mall was not in use.\n\nOne survivor, Oleksandr, a mall employee, told the AP from a hospital bed that the shopping center was packed with customers. He recalled stepping outside with a colleague for a cigarette when the air raid siren went off.\n\n\"There was a black tunnel, smoke, fire,\" he said. \"I started to crawl. I saw the sun up there, and my brain was telling me I needed to save myself.\"\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity.\" She emphasized the need for all Ukrainians to remain alert and expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. Six more people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire came as the G-7 leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of a summit starting this week in Madrid, and an early signal of unity came Tuesday when Turkey agreed to lift its opposition to Sweden and Finland joining NATO.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine prompted the two Nordic countries to abandon their long-held nonaligned status and apply to join NATO. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had blocked the move, insisting they change their stance on Kurdish rebel groups that Turkey considers terrorists.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the West that \"the more weapons are pumped into Ukraine, the longer the conflict will continue and the longer the agony of the Nazi regime backed by Western capitals will last.\"\n\nRussia has falsely called the war a campaign to \"de-Nazify\" Ukraine -- a country with a democratically elected Jewish president who wants closer ties with the West.\n\nIn a sinister message to NATO leaders, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where their summit will be held.\n\nIt also posted images and the coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin -- referring to them as \"decision-making centers supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app. That wording echoes warnings from Russian President Vladimir Putin that he could target such centers in response to what he has called Western aggression.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n-- One of the two Britons sentenced to death by separatist forces in eastern Ukraine has filed a formal appeal, the Russian news agency Tass reported early Wednesday. The report said the appeal filed on behalf of Shaun Pinner will be considered within two months.\n\nPinner, Aiden Aslin and Moroccan Brahim Saadoun were sentenced to death on June 9 and were given one month to appeal. The court claimed they were fighting for Ukraine as mercenaries so were not entitled to protections provided to prisoners of war. There was no mention of appeals for the other two men.\n\n-- The two fighting countries continued a sporadic series of prisoner exchanges. Ukraine exchanged 15 Russian prisoners-of-war for 16 Ukrainian soldiers and one civilian, the Ukrainian Pravda news outlet reported Tuesday.\n\n-- Ukrainian Pravda also reported that in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, the mayor was detained Tuesday and occupying authorities seized his computer hard drive and documents after he had refused to cooperate with Russian-appointed local officials. Russia's Tass news agency confirmed the detention.\n\n-- Bulgaria said Tuesday it was expelling 70 Russian diplomats designated \"a threat to national security,\" ordering them to leave within five days. A Bulgarian foreign ministry statement said this would reduce Russia's Sofia embassy staff \"to up to 23 diplomatic and 25 administrative and technical staff.\"\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

He called Monday's attack on the mall ''a new war crime.''\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian authorities claimed that the shopping center was not the target.\n\nHow to counter Russia and back Ukraine will be the focus of a summit this week of the western NATO alliance, whose support has been critical to Kyiv's ability to fend off Moscow's larger and better equipped forces.\n\nUkrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to continue to hold off and even drive back Russia, which is pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern region of the Donbas.\n\nAs Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall that authorities said was struck when more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when there was an explosion.\n\nThe blast knocked her down. When another came about 10 minutes later, she realized she needed to get away.\n\n''I ran away from the epicenter with all of my strength,'' she said. Fighting back tears, she added: ''You have to be a real monster'' to strike a shopping mall.\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said.\n\nSeveral of the bodies of those who didn't make it out in time are burned beyond recognition and their identification could take days, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded. Another 21 people are still missing, Monastyrsky said.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theater, a train station, and a hospital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it ''one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history,'' while the G-7 leaders said ''indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.''\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the UN Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the attack.\n\nAs condemnation of the strike came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals.\n\nHe said the hostilities could stop ''before the end of the day'' if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognizing its control over territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire.\n\nUkrainian authorities said in addition to the direct hit on the mall, a factory was also struck, but denied that any weapons were there.\n\nKonashenkov also alleged that the mall was not in use, a false claim contradicted by witnesses.\n\nOne survivor, Oleksandr, an employee at the mall, told the AP from a hospital bed that the shopping center was packed with customers. He recalled stepping outside with a colleague for a cigarette, when the air raid siren went off.\n\n''There was a black tunnel, smoke, fire,'' he said. ''I started to crawl. I saw the sun up there, and my brain was telling me I need to save myself.''\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's ''crimes against humanity,'' noting that Moscow's military has been ''systematically shelling civilian infrastructure with the aim to scare people, to kill people, to bring terror to our cities and villages.''\n\nVenediktova emphasized the need for Ukrainians across the entire country to remain alert, adding that they should expect a similar strike ''every minute.''\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child.\n\nA further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to local officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire in recent days came as the G-7 leaders gathered in Europe. They pledged continued support for Ukraine and the world's major economies prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of its summit as the alliance turns its attention once again to confronting an adversarial Russia.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the West that ''the more weapons are pumped into Ukraine, the longer the conflict will continue and the longer the agony of the Nazi regime backed by Western capitals will last.''\n\nRussia has falsely called the war a campaign to ''de-Nazify'' Ukraine, a country with a democratically elected Jewish president who wants closer ties with the West.\n\nIn a sinister message to NATO leaders who gathered in Madrid ahead of that summit, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where the meeting will be held.\n\nIt also posted images and the coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin, referring to them as ''decision-making centers supporting the Ukrainian nationalists'' in a message on the Telegram app.\n\nThat wording echoes Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier warnings that he could target such centers in response to what he has called Western aggression.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://english.ahram.org.eg/Media/News/2022/6/28/41_2022-637920395664307892-430.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 36, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 48, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094165095", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "00:53:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T00:53:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T00:53:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5960784554481506, "url": "https://www.kiro7.com/news/trending/russian-missile-strikes-crowded-ukraine-shopping-mall-mass-casualties-feared/WJTP447L7RGR7BKJUPZPY6W3U4/", "title": "Russian missile strikes crowded Ukraine shopping mall;

'There were more than a thousand civilians' in the mall, Volodymyr Zelensky said, 'The mall is on fire, rescuers are fighting the fire. The number of victims is impossible to imagine'. The blaze covers 10,000 sq m.\n\nSince the initial invasion, there have been fears that Russia would move on from its reliance on tanks and switch to missiles - flattening the parts of Ukraine that it could not invade. It would be fairly easily done, but Putin at first held back - perhaps mindful of how hard civilian casualties would be to explain in Russia. There was always the risk that the war would escalate in such a way. Some 65 missiles were fired over the weekend, 14 of them hitting Kyiv.\n\nThe recent increase in missile attacks is seen by many in Ukraine and Europe as timed to coincide with the G7 summit - a signal that far worse could be to come, that Russia could yet do to Ukrainian cities what it did to Grozny. Co-chair European Council on foreign relations Carl Bildt said recently 'It's difficult to see this morning's missile attack against residential areas of Kyiv as anything but a deliberate Russian escalation and a signal to the G7 meeting in Elmau today'.\n\nWhether deliberate or accidental, a shopping mall strike will be difficult for Moscow to present as a military target. Russia's self-appointed 'war correspondents' are already out on social media saying that the Kremenchuk attack was carried out by the Ukrainian military. 'Ukraine paid actors who are in mall running,' says Voenkor, a Russian telegram channel. 'They will put corpses in the mall and claim they are citizens'.\n\nThe biggest missile strike so far was that directed at the theatre in Mariupol which was being used as a shelter: with up to 600 feared dead. The 8 April strike on the Kramatorsk railway station killed an estimated 61 people and wounded 121. Russia has a formidable arsenal of ballistic missiles with almost all of Luhansk under Russian control.

Ukrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to hold off and even drive back Russia, which is pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern region of the Donbas.\n\nAs Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall that authorities said was struck when more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when an explosion knocked her down. When another blast came about 10 minutes later, she realized she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicenter with all of my strength,\" she said. Fighting back tears, she added: \"You have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said. Several of the bodies of those who didn't make it out in time are burned beyond recognition, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded. Another 21 people are still missing, Monastyrsky said.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theater, a train station, and a hospital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\"\n\nRocket attacks continued elsewhere in Ukraine, with authorities in the city of Dnipro reporting that workers at a diesel car repair shop were trapped in rubble after a strike from a cruise missile fired from the Black Sea, Ukrainian news agencies reported. The Ukrainian military managed to intercept and destroy other missiles fired at the city, the agencies said.\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the Kremenchuk attack.\n\nAs condemnation came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals. He said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognizing its control over territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire. Ukrainian authorities said that in addition to the direct hit on the mall, a factory was struck, but denied it housed weapons.\n\nKonashenkov also alleged that the mall was not in use, a false claim that witnesses contradicted.\n\nOne survivor, Oleksandr, a mall employee, told the AP from a hospital bed that the shopping center was packed with customers. He recalled stepping outside with a colleague for a cigarette when the air raid siren went off.\n\n\"There was a black tunnel, smoke, fire,\" he said. \"I started to crawl. I saw the sun up there, and my brain was telling me I need to save myself.\"\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity.\" She emphasized the need for all Ukrainians to remain alert and expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. A further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire came as the G-7 leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of a summit starting this week in Madrid, and an early signal of unity came Tuesday when Turkey agreed to lift its opposition to Sweden and Finland joining NATO.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine prompted the Nordic pair to abandon their long-held nonaligned status and apply to join NATO. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had blocked the move, insisting the Nordic pair change their stance on Kurdish rebel groups that Turkey considers terrorists.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the West that \"the more weapons are pumped into Ukraine, the longer the conflict will continue and the longer the agony of the Nazi regime backed by Western capitals will last.\"\n\nRussia has falsely called the war a campaign to \"de-Nazify\" Ukraine -- a country with a democratically elected Jewish president who wants closer ties with the West.\n\nIn a sinister message to NATO leaders, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where their summit will be held.\n\nIt also posted images and the coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin -- referring to them as \"decision-making centers supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app. That wording echoes Russian President Vladimir Putin's warnings that he could target such centers in response to what he has called Western aggression.\n\nIn other developments, the two fighting countries continued a sporadic series of prisoner exchanges. Ukraine exchanged 15 Russian prisoners-of-war for 16 Ukrainian soldiers and one civilian, the Ukrainian Pravda news outlet reported Tuesday.\n\nUkrainian Pravda also reported that in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, the mayor was detained Tuesday and occupying authorities seized his computer hard drive and documents after he had refused to cooperate with Russian-appointed local officials. Russia's Tass news agency confirmed the detention.\n\nMeanwhile, Bulgaria said Tuesday it was expelling 70 Russian diplomats designated \"a threat to national security,\" ordering them to leave within 5 days.\n\nA Bulgarian foreign ministry statement said this would reduce Russia's Sofia embassy staff \"to up to 23 diplomatic and 25 administrative and technical staff.\"\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

Ukrainian troops have offered \"stiff resistance,\" according to U.S. officials.\n\nThe Russian military has since launched a full-scale ground offensive in eastern Ukraine's disputed Donbas region, capturing the strategic port city of Mariupol and securing a coastal corridor to the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula.\n\nHere's how the news is developing. All times Eastern:\n\nJun 28, 8:17 am\n\nRussian forces in Ukraine 'are increasingly hollowed out,' UK says\n\nUkrainian forces are still consolidating their positions on higher ground in the eastern city of Lyschansak after falling back from nearby Sieverodonetsk, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said Tuesday in an intelligence update.\n\n\"Ukrainian forces continue to disrupt Russian command and control with successful strikes deep behind Russian lines,\" the ministry added.\n\nAccording to the ministry, Russian forces over the weekend \"launched unusually intense waves of strikes across Ukraine using long-range missiles.\"\n\n\"These weapons highly likely included the Soviet-era AS-4 KITCHEN and more modern AS-23a KODIAK missiles, fired from both Belarusian and Russian airspace,\" the ministry said. \"These weapons were designed to take on targets of strategic importance, but Russia continues to expend them in large numbers for tactical advantage. Similarly, it fielded the core elements of six different armies yet achieved only tactical success at Sieverodonetsk.\"\n\n\"The Russian armed forces are increasingly hollowed out,\" the ministry added. \"They currently accept a level of degraded combat effectiveness, which is probably unsustainable in the long term.\n\nJun 28, 6:22 am\n\nDeath toll from mall strike rises to 18\n\nThe death toll from a Russian missile strike on a Ukrainian shopping mall continued to rise Tuesday as rescuers sifted through the charred rubble.\n\nMonday's attack in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk killed at least 18 people and wounded 59 others, including 25 who remain hospitalized Tuesday, according to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine. A day of mourning for the victims was declared Tuesday in the wider Poltava Oblast.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday in his nightly address that more than 1,000 shoppers and workers were inside the mall during the afternoon attack and that it will take time to \"establish the number of victims.\" He condemned the incident as \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\"\n\nJun 28, 5:49 am\n\nUkraine joining NATO could lead to WWIII, Russia warns\n\nRussia warned Tuesday that Ukraine joining NATO could lead to World War III should Kyiv then attempt to encroach on the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula.\n\n\"Crimea is a part of Russia for us. And that means forever,\" Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said in an interview Tuesday with Russian newspaper Argumenty i Fakty. \"Any attempt to encroach on Crimea is a declaration of war against our country. If a NATO member country does so, this would mean a conflict with the North Atlantic Alliance. The World War III. A complete catastrophe.\"\n\n\"Ukraine within NATO is far more dangerous for our country [than Sweden and Finland],\" he added. \"And this is linked to what [Russian] President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly spoken about: the presence of unresolved territorial disputes, as well as the difference in understanding of the regions' status.\"\n\nAlthough Moscow is not opposed to Sweden and Finland joining the military alliance, Russia will still have to reinforce its borders in this case, according to Medvedev.\n\n\"Accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO will not pose any new threats to us,\" he told Argumenty i Fakty. \"If they feel better and calmer by joining the alliance, then so be it. Even without them, without Sweden and Finland, NATO is close to our country.\"\n\n\"Should this enlargement of NATO happen, the length of its land borders with Russia will more than double. And we will have to strengthen these borders,\" he added. \"The Baltic region's non-nuclear status will become a thing of the past, the group of land and naval forces in the northern sector will be seriously increased. No one is happy with it. Nor are the citizens of these two NATO candidate countries.\"\n\nJun 27, 6:42 pm\n\nZelenskyy calls mall attack one of 'the most defiant terrorist attack in European history'\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lashed out against Russian forces in a recorded speech Monday hours after a missile struck a shopping mall in Kremenchuk, calling the attack \"one of the most defiant terrorist attacks in European history.\"\n\n\"Only totally insane terrorists, who should have no place on earth, can strike missiles at such an object. And this is not an off-target missile strike, this is a calculated Russian strike -- exactly at this shopping mall,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe Ukrainian president said the rescue and salvage efforts were still ongoing.\n\nUkraine's Emergency Service reported that 15 people were killed and 59 were injured in the attack as of Monday evening.\n\n\"We must be aware that the losses may be significant,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nG-7 leaders released a statement condemning Russia's missile strike on a shopping mall in Kremenchuk, Ukraine, saying it constitutes a war crime and that President Vladimir Putin \"and those responsible will be held to account.\"\n\n\"We stand united with Ukraine in mourning the innocent victims of this brutal attack,\" they said.\n\nThe summit began in Germany on Sunday with a heavy focus on the invasion of Ukraine, and the group announced more steps to try and stop Putin from funding his war.\n\n\"Today, we underlined our unwavering support for Ukraine in the face of the Russian aggression, an unjustified war of choice that has been raging for 124 days. We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian as well as military support for Ukraine, for as long as it takes. We will not rest until Russia ends its cruel and senseless war on Ukraine,\" G-7 leaders said.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "image":

direct Russian missile strike against the busy shopping centre in Kremenchuk. The G7 called the hit a Russian war crime, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said it was \"one of the most defiant terrorist attacks in European history,\" accusing Russia of directly targeting civilians.\n\nMoscow on Tuesday rejected those accounts, saying it had hit a legitimate military target in the city, and that the shopping centre was not in use.\n\n\"In Kremenchuk, Russian forces struck a weapons depot storing arms received from the United States and Europe with high-precision air-based weapons.

At least 18 people died and about 60 were wounded in the Monday strike, according to Ukrainian officials, but Russia claims it only hit a legitimate military target near the mall.\n\nVideo from security cameras in the area clearly caught the moment when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says a Russian X-22 cruise missile slammed into the shopping center in the central city of Kremenchuk. A shockwave ripples across the area just before people in a park are seen falling to the ground and fleeing for cover.\n\nEmergency workers were still searching through the wreckage of the shopping center on Wednesday, with about 20 people still listed as missing.\n\nZelenskyy shared another video that he said showed the X-22 rocket -- a long-range cruise missile designed in the former Soviet Union to sink American aircraft carriers -- flying at an angle into the mall, sending a huge fireball and debris flying in all directions. The Ukrainian leader pleaded on Tuesday for the United Nations to \"act immediately\" to \"hold Russia accountable\" for what he has described as a terrorist attack on his country.\n\n\"Absolute terrorism\" - says @ZelenskyyUa and publishes a video of a deliberate missile strike on the Kremenchuk shopping center with people inside.

Various Russian accounts have suggested the site targeted was a depot stocked with Western-supplied weapons or a base for Ukrainian military vehicles.\n\nCBS News visited the facility just north of the mall, however, and found an asphalt factory. We met Mykola Danyleiko, chairman of the board for the Kredmash Road Machinery Plant, which mixes asphalt to pave roads.\n\n\"It's fake,\" he told CBS News of the Russian claims. \"They said we send products from here by railroad.

Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting for Tuesday.\n\n\"Sickening. Absolutely sickening,\" U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said of the attack on the mall in Kremenchuk, adding that the Security Council would meet \"to discuss Russia's atrocities against civilians.\"\n\n\"We must continue to hold Russia accountable.\"\n\nThe Security Council has met frequently to discuss the Ukraine crisis since Russia invaded in February, but has been unable to adopt a single resolution in response. Russia vetoed the one attempt to do so, one day after President Vladimir Putin announced the start of the offensive.\n\nRussia's deputy U.N. ambassador insinuated on Twitter that Ukraine had attacked its own citizens in the shopping center, in a bid to gain attention ahead of a NATO summit that begins in Madrid on Tuesday.\n\n\"Looks like we are dealing with a new Bucha-style Ukrainian provocation,\" said Dmitry Polyanskiy. \"One should wait for what our Ministry of Defence will say, but there are too many striking discrepancies already. Exactly what Kiev regime needs to keep focus of attention on Ukraine before NATO Summit.\"\n\n(In Bucha and other small towns near Kyiv the bodies of hundreds of civilians - some with hands bound and bearing signs of torture - were found after Russian forces withdrew at the end of March. The Kremlin claims the evidence was staged to implicate Russians in atrocities carried out by Ukrainian fighters.)\n\nUkraine's defense ministry said the shopping mall was struck by Russian X-22 cruise missiles launched from a long-range bomber. Russian forces have frequently used such weapons and delivery platforms since invading in February, while denying targeting civilian infrastructure.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said around 1,000 people had been inside the mall when air raid sirens sounded, and that many had fortunately \"managed to get out in time.\" Ukrainian media, citing local government officials, said at least 15 people were killed and more than 40 were wounded.\n\nKremenchuk lies some 160 miles southeast of Kyiv, and about 80 miles from the nearest Russian-held territory in eastern Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian officials accused Russia of intentionally targeting civilians, in what Zelenskyy described as \"one of the most defiant terrorist attacks in European history.\"\n\n\"Only totally insane terrorists, who should have no place on earth, can strike missiles at such an object,\" he said in his nightly video message to the nation. \"And this is not an off-target missile strike, this is a calculated Russian strike - exactly at this shopping mall.\"\n\n\"Russia is a disgrace to humanity and it must face consequences,\" said Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. \"The response should be more heavy arms for Ukraine, more sanctions on Russia, and more businesses leaving Russia.\"\n\nAnton Gerashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine's internal affairs minister, called Russia \"a terrorist state.\"\n\nIn keeping with the narrative promoted by Polyanskiy at the U.N. in New York, Russia's Vzglyad daily quoted a \"military expert\" as saying the pattern was always the same: Ukrainian forces either deliberately attack their civilian population, or do so as a result of incompetence, then Kyiv blames Russia, Western media echo the allegations, and NATO countries announce new sanctions on Russia or arms packages for Ukraine.\n\nSeveral other Russian outlets, including Kommersant and Komsomolskaya Pravda, reported that \"an explosion occurred\" in the mall, followed by a fire.\n\nAt the summit in southern Germany, President Biden told G7 leaders that the U.S. aims to provide Ukraine with \"advanced medium- and long-range air defense capabilities,\" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said during a briefing late on Monday night.\n\nHe said Zelenskyy, who joined part of the meeting by video link, had voiced a \"desire to get additional air defense capabilities that could shoot down Russian missiles out in sky.\"\n\n\"So, the president was able to be positively responsive to him on that,\" Sullivan said.\n\nIn a tweet from Germany meeting, Biden called the Russian attack \"cruel.\"\n\n\"We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people,\" he said. \"As demonstrated at the G7 Summit, the U.S. along with our allies and partners will continue to hold Russia accountable for such atrocities and support Ukraine's defense.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called the attack an \"abomination\" and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it had \"shown once again the depths of cruelty and barbarism to which the Russian leader will sink.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNSNews.com"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.cnsnews.com/s3/files/styles/pull_image/s3/2022-06/UNSC-may2022G-1.jpg?itok=xDNT2pKn", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 22, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 33, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093717731", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "15:42:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T15:42:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T15:30:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "url": "https://www.laprensalatina.com/russian-missile-strikes-crowded-shopping-mall-in-central-ukraine/", "title": "Russian missile strikes crowded shopping mall in central Ukraine - La Prensa Latina Media", "body": "Kyiv, Jun 27 (EFE).- A Russian missile on Monday struck a shopping mall in central Ukraine with over 1,000 civilians inside, sparking a large fire in the building, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.\n\nImages from the strike in the city Kremenchuk appeared to show a large fire had engulfed the building, which the Ukrainian president said posed no threat to Russia and held \"no strategic value.\"\n\n\"The mall is on fire, firefighters are trying to extinguish the fire, the number of victims is impossible to imagine,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\n\"Out of helplessness, Russia continues to hit ordinary people.

Video / The Kyiv Independent\n\nRussian forces have battled to surround the Ukrainian military's last stronghold in a long-contested eastern province, as shock reverberated from a Russian airstrike on a shopping mall that killed at least 18 in the centre of the country two days earlier.\n\nMoscow's battle to wrest the entire Donbas region from Ukraine saw Russian forces pushing toward two Luhansk province villages south of the city of Lysychansk while Ukrainian troops fought to prevent their encirclement.\n\nBritain's defence ministry said Russian forces were making \"incremental advances\" in their offensive to capture the city. Lysychansk is the last major area of the province under Ukrainian control following the retreat of Ukraine's forces from the neighbouring city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nRussian troops and their separatist allies control 95 per cent of Luhansk and about half of the Donetsk region, the other province that makes up the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas.\n\nThe latest assessment by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said the Ukrainians were likely in a fighting withdrawal to seek more defensible positions while draining the Russian military forces of manpower and resources.\n\nMeanwhile, crews continued to search through the rubble of the shopping mall in Kremenchuk where Ukrainian authorities say 20 people remain missing. Authorities in the city declared three days of mourning.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Services press officer Svitlana Rybalko told The Associated Press that along with the 18 people killed, investigators found fragments of eight more bodies. It was not immediately clear whether that meant there were more victims. A number of survivors suffered severed limbs.\n\n\"The police cannot say for sure how many [victims] there are. So we are finding not the bodies but the fragments of bodies,\" Rybalko said. \"Now we are clearing at the very epicentre of the blast. Here, we practically cannot find bodies as such.\"\n\nSeveral families stood by what was left of the Amstor shopping centre Wednesday morning in hope of finding missing loved ones.\n\n\"This is pure genocide,\" local resident Tatiana Chernyshova said while going to lay flowers at the site. \"Such things cannot happen in the 21st century.\"\n\nPsychologists working at the site with families said they were trying to help people come to terms with their loss.\n\n\"We are trying to help them release their emotions now, as later it becomes harder and much more painful,\" said one psychologist, who did not give his name as he was not authorised to speak to the press.\n\nAfter the attack on the mall, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of becoming \"a terrorist\" state. He reproached Nato for not embracing or equipping his embattled country more fully.\n\n\"The open-door policy of Nato shouldn't resemble old turnstiles on Kyiv's subway, which stay open but close when you approach them until you pay,\" Zelenskyy told Nato leaders meeting in Madrid, speaking by video link. \"Hasn't Ukraine paid enough? Hasn't our contribution to defending Europe and the entire civilisation been sufficient?\"\n\nHe asked for more modern artillery systems and other weapons and warned the Nato leaders they either had to provide Ukraine with the help it needed to defeat Russia or \"face a delayed war between Russia and yourself\".\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed what she claimed was the Ukrainian government's \"blatant provocation\" in trying to blame the mall missile strike on Russia's military.\n\nBritain's defence ministry said there was a \"realistic possibility\" that the mall strike \"was intended to hit a nearby infrastructure target\".\n\n\"Russian planners highly likely remain willing to accept a high level of collateral damage when they perceive military necessity in striking a target,\" the ministry said. \"It is almost certain that Russia will continue to conduct strikes in an effort to interdict the resupplying of Ukrainian front-line forces.\"\n\nRussia's military also is experiencing a shortage of more modern precision strike weapons that is compounding civilian casualties, the British ministry said.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, a Russian missile strike on a multi-story apartment building in the city of Mykolaiv killed at least four people and injured five, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said. Mykolaiv is a major port and seizing it - as well as Odesa further west - would be key to Russia's objective of cutting off Ukraine from its Black Sea coast.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said in a statement that the missile strike on Mykolaiv targeted a base for training \"foreign mercenaries\" as well as ammunition depots.\n\nKyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko on Tuesday urged Nato leaders in Madrid to do whatever it took to stop the war, saying that if Ukraine is defeated, \"you're going to be next\".\n\nIn other developments:\n\n* A senior Russian lawmaker has warned that Lithuania's refusal to allow some goods targeted by European Union sanctions through to Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad could trigger a military confrontation.\n\nWednesday's statement by Vladimir Dzhabarov, a deputy head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of Russia's parliament, followed the Kremlin's warning that it will retaliate against restrictions of transit to Kaliningrad. The region borders EU and Nato members Poland and Lithuania.\n\n* Russia's foreign ministry summoned Norway's charge d'affaires to protest Oslo's blocking of a shipment of supplies to a Russian coal-mining town in the Svalbard islands.\n\nAlthough the Svalbards are Norwegian territory, a 1920 treaty allows all signatory countries the right to exploit its natural resources. Russia operates a coal mine in Barentsburg, a settlement of about 450 people, which relies on shipments from the mainland of food, machinery and other supplies. Norway imposed sanctions on shipments from Russia in April.\n\n* Ukrainian military intelligence says that in the largest prisoner swap since the start of the war 144 Ukrainian troops were released from Russian captivity. Of those released, 95 were involved in defending the Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's devastated southern city of Mariupol that Russian forces captured weeks ago. Denis Pushilin, the leader of the separatist Donetsk People's Republic, said that the exchange saw an equal number of soldiers released by either side.\n\n* European Union leaders approved Wednesday a 600-million euro ($1 billion) package to address food security issues brought on by the Ukraine war in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.\n\n* Britain is imposing sanctions on Russia's second-richest man and on a cousin of President Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Potanin, owner of the Interross conglomerate, has continued to amass wealth while backing Putin, acquiring Rosbank and shares in Tinkoff Bankonith in the period following the invasion of Ukraine, a UK government statement said.\n\nThe statement said Putin's cousin, Anna Tsivileva, and her husband, Sergey Tsivilev, have \"significantly benefited\" from their relationship with Putin.

Late into the night, rescue workers toiled to clear the remains of the building in order to secure the area, put out the last fires and recover any further victims.\n\nIryna Venediktova, Ukraine's Prosecutor General, was in the shopping mall's parking lot with Poltava prosecutor Stoletnii Anton, according to whom there are \"currently 36 still missing.\" A command center has been set up close to the parking lot so that families can submit their missing persons reports. \"We currently have 18 civilian victims,\" said the prosecutor, \"but that doesn't count the body parts, arms and legs, that we've found in the building. Identifying them will take time.\" There are also 59 injured, 25 of whom have been hospitalized. At 10 am, 40% of the old shopping mall was still to be cleared according to Mr. Anton.\n\nThe missile strike on this city some 200 kilometers from the frontline, relatively unscathed since war broke out, has sent shockwaves around the world. In a post on Telegram showing a video of the burning building, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the shopping mall presented \"no threat to the Russian army\" and had \"no strategic value.\" During his nightly video address to the nation, the commander-in-chief went further, stating that Russian forces had intentionally targeted the mall and that the strike was \"one of the most defiant terrorist attacks in European history.\" According to the president, the missile hit \"a peaceful city, an ordinary shopping mall with women, children, ordinary civilians inside.\"\n\nThe airstrike hit the building when it was at its busiest in the middle of the afternoon, at a time when G7 leaders were meeting at the summit in Elmau, southern Germany. The atrocity was strongly condemned. \"We stand united with Ukraine in mourning the innocent victims of this cruel attack,\" the leaders of the seven most industrialized countries said in a joint statement posted on Twitter. \"Indiscriminate attacks against innocent civilians are a war crime,\" they added. \"Russian President Putin and those responsible will be held to account.\"\n\nThe world is \"horrified\" by this strike, \"the latest in a string of atrocities,\" said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

Ukrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to hold off and even drive back Russia, which is pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern region of the Donbas.\n\nAs Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall that authorities said was struck when more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when an explosion knocked her down. When another blast came about 10 minutes later, she realized she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicenter with all of my strength,\" she said. Fighting back tears, she added: \"You have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said. Several of the bodies of those who didn't make it out in time are burned beyond recognition and their identification could take days, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded. Another 21 people are still missing, Monastyrsky said.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theater, a train station, and a hospital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history,\" while the G-7 leaders said \"indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.\"\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the attack.\n\nAs condemnation of the strike came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals. He said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognizing its control over territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire. Ukrainian authorities said that in addition to the direct hit on the mall, a factory was struck, but denied it housed any weapons.\n\nKonashenkov also alleged that the mall was not in use, a false claim that witnesses contradicted.\n\nOne survivor, Oleksandr, a mall employee, told the AP from a hospital bed that the shopping center was packed with customers. He recalled stepping outside with a colleague for a cigarette when the air raid siren went off.\n\n\"There was a black tunnel, smoke, fire,\" he said. \"I started to crawl. I saw the sun up there, and my brain was telling me I need to save myself.\"\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity,\" noting that Moscow's military has been \"systematically shelling civilian infrastructure with the aim to scare people, to kill people, to bring terror to our cities and villages.\"\n\nVenediktova emphasized the need for Ukrainians across the entire country to remain alert, adding that they should expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. A further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to local officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire in recent days came as the G-7 leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of a summit starting this week in Madrid as the alliance turns its attention once again to confronting an adversarial Russia.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the West that \"the more weapons are pumped into Ukraine, the longer the conflict will continue and the longer the agony of the Nazi regime backed by Western capitals will last.\"\n\nRussia has falsely called the war a campaign to \"de-Nazify\" Ukraine -- a country with a democratically elected Jewish president who wants closer ties with the West.\n\nIn a sinister message to NATO leaders, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where their summit will be held.\n\nIt also posted images and the coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin -- referring to them as \"decision-making centers supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app. That wording echoes Russian President Vladimir Putin's warnings that he could target such centers in response to what he has called Western aggression.\n\nIn other developments, the two fighting countries continued a sporadic series of prisoner exchanges. Ukraine exchanged 15 Russian prisoners-of-war for 16 Ukrainian soldiers and one civilian, the Ukrainian Pravda news outlet reported Tuesday.\n\nUkrainian Pravda also reported that in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, the mayor was detained Tuesday. The news outlet said occupying authorities seized Igor Kolykhaiev's computer hard drive and documents after he had refused to cooperate with Russian-appointed local officials. Russia's Tass news agency confirmed the detention.\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

Kremenchuk has overshadowed the final day of the G7 summit in Germany.\n\nIn a joint statement, Boris Johnson and the leaders of the US, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italy condemned the 'abominable attack'.\n\n'We stand united with Ukraine in mourning the innocent victims of this brutal attack,' they said.\n\n'Indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.\n\n'Russian President Putin and those responsible will be held to account.'\n\nThe strike on Monday came as Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky appeared via video link at the G7 summit to call for more sophisticated missile defences.\n\nRussia's defence ministry denied hitting the shopping centre on Tuesday, instead claiming it had struck a weapons depot nearby with the subsequent explosion triggering a fire in mall next door.\n\n'In Kremenchuk, Russian forces struck a weapons depot storing arms received from the United States and Europe with high-precision air-based weapons,' Moscow's defence ministry said in a statement posted on its Telegram channel.\n\n'As a result of the precision strike, Western-made weapons and ammunition concentrated in the warehouse ... were hit.\n\n'The detonation of stored ammunition for Western weapons caused a fire in a non-functioning shopping centre located next to the depot,' it added.\n\nHowever, Ukraine has said the shopping centre was hit directly by Russian missiles and around 1,000 people were inside at the time of the strike.\n\nAt least 18 people have died and more than 60 have been injured, but the death toll is expected to rise as emergency workers search the rubble of the building.\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has dominated the G7 summit in the Bavarian Alps.\n\nAnd the battle against the Russian invasion is set to remain at the top of the diplomatic agenda when leaders of Nato, including Mr Johnson, gather in Madrid on Tuesday.\n\nMr Johnson said the Kremenchuk attack 'has shown once again the depths of cruelty and barbarism to which the Russian leader will sink' but it would 'strengthen the resolve' of Ukraine and its G7 allies.\n\nThe prime minister also urged Russian scientists to defect to the UK to escape Mr Putin's oppression, as he also set out a package of support for Ukrainian researchers.\n\nMr Johnson said experts who no longer feel safe in Russia should apply to come to a country that 'values openness, freedom and the pursuit of knowledge'.\n\nUkraine has reported a sharp escalation in Russian attacks in recent days.\n\nOn Sunday, a residential building in the capital Kyiv was hit in the first attack on the capital since early June.\n\nAlongside the shopping centre, Ukraine said Russian missiles also hit the eastern cities of Kharkiv and Lysychansk on Monday in one of the bloodiest days for civilian casualties in weeks.\n\nSpeaking hours after the first casualties were reported from Kremenchuk, Russia's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Dmitry Polyanskiy,

But that didn't stop the Kremlin from churning out disinformation to explain away the tragedy.\n\nFirst, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed the mall caught fire after Russian forces successfully launched an airstrike at a nearby depot storing \"Western supplied weapons and ammunition.\"\n\nThat is despite security camera video, released by Ukraine President Vladimir Zelenskyy, showing a Russian X-22 cruise missile diving into the mall. And Ukraine said the factory nearby made road-building equipment, not armaments.\n\nMoscow pivoted to another line: The strike was a false-flag operation, as earlier when Russian troops were credibly accused of atrocities in the town of Bucha.\n\n\"Bucha 2.0: Kyiv unleashes an explosion in Kremenchuk,\" the website of Kremlin-friendly Tsargrad TV said. \"What is known so far.\"\n\nRussia's ambassador to Ireland, Yuriy Filatov, said the claim that Russia attacked the mall was \"yet another disinformation stunt.\"\n\n\"Regrettably, we have seen all that before - Ukrainian authorities manufacture - [a] distorted news item, their Western patrons quickly use it in the interest of anti-Russian propaganda,\" Filatov wrote on Telegraph.\n\nRussia's deputy permanent U.N. representative, Dmitry Polyansky, said on Twitter: \"Looks like we are dealing with a new #Bucha-style #Ukrainian provocation.\"\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry claimed the mall was not open at the time.

While the gas supply to the member states is currently guaranteed, the security of supply risks are greater than ever,\" she added, noting that Russian gas exports to the EU are half of what they were a year ago.\n\nHowever, she said the security of supply risks were \"not immediate\" and the European gas system had \"reacted well and so far has been able to absorb the cuts.\"\n\nSimson added the European Commission will propose an EU plan to prepare for further gas shocks in July, as Russia has already cut or reduced supplies to 12 of the bloc's 27 member states.\n\nThere can be no return to what the ties with Russia were before the war in Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Monday, adding that the war waged by Moscow is a \"deep, deep cut in international relations.\"\n\nThe war is \"a matter of long-lasting changes that will shape international relations for a very, very long time,\" Scholz said during a news conference on the sidelines of the G7 summit in the Bavarian Alps in southern Germany.\n\n\"In our relations with Russia there can be no going back to the time before the Russian invasion of Ukraine,\" he added.\n\nDespite uncertainty about how the world would change as a result of the war, the G7 members should \"master this change\" by \"standing together and working together closely and in a spirit of trust,\" he added.\n\n\"And that is what unites us: democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights,\" he said.\n\nTurkey's security concerns on Nordic membership bids are legitimate and must be addressed, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has stated.\n\nSpeaking at a joint press conference with Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson, ahead of the NATO summit in Madrid, Stoltenberg said \"no ally has suffered more at the hands of terrorists ... including grievous attacks by the terrorist group PKK.\"\n\nThe NATO chief added the alliance should redouble its efforts in the fight against terrorism, and a special session devoted to NATO's counterterrorism efforts will be convened during the summit in the Spanish capital.\n\n\"We are now working together on an agreement between Sweden, Finland, and our ally Turkey to further address security concerns, including around arms exports and the fight against terrorism,\" Stoltenberg continued.\n\nG7 leaders condemned the \"abominable\" attack on a Ukraine shopping mall in a joint statement on Monday.\n\n\"We, the Leaders of the G7, solemnly condemn the abominable attack on a shopping mall in Kremenchuk,\" the statement reads.\n\n\"Indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.

Any sort of civilian infrastructure, which includes obviously shopping malls, and civilians should never ever be targeted,\" Dujarric told reporters.\n\nIn a tweet Monday, US President Joe Biden, who's in Germany attending the G7 summit, condemned a Russian missile attack on a shopping mall in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk, writing, \"Russia's attack on civilians at a shopping mall is cruel. We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people.\"\n\n\"As demonstrated at the G7 Summit, the U.S. along with our allies and partners will continue to hold Russia accountable for such atrocities and support Ukraine's defense,\" Biden added.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken has also voiced horror at Russia's deadly strike on a crowded mall and vowed to hold Moscow responsible.\n\n\"The world is horrified by Russia's missile strike today, which hit a crowded Ukrainian shopping mall - the latest in a string of atrocities,\" Blinken wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"We will continue to support our Ukrainian partners and hold Russia, including those responsible for atrocities, to account,\" he continued.\n\nRussia must answer for the deadly missile strike on a crowded Ukrainian shopping centre, France's Foreign Ministry has said, condemning the attack.\n\n\"Russia must answer for these acts. France supports the fight against impunity in Ukraine,\" the Foreign Ministry's spokeswoman added in a statement.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the attack at a mall in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk on Monday showed the \"depths of cruelty and barbarism\" to which Russian President Vladimir Putin would sink to, the UK's PA news agency reported.\n\n\"This appalling attack has shown once again the depths of cruelty and barbarism to which the Russian leader will sink,\" Johnson stated.\n\nMore than 1,000 people were inside the mall when a Russian missile was fired at the building, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\"Once again our thoughts are with the families of innocent victims in Ukraine. Putin must realize that his behavior will do nothing but strengthen the resolve of the Ukraine and every other G7 country to stand by the Ukraine for as long as it takes,\" the British prime minister added.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden has raised the tariff rate on certain Russian imports to 35 percent as a result of suspending Russia's \"most favoured nation\" trading status over its war in Ukraine, according to a proclamation issued by the White House.\n\nThe higher 35 percent duty applies to imports of \"certain other products of the Russian Federation, the importation of which has not already been prohibited,\" the proclamation said.\n\nThe Biden administration previously banned US imports of Russian petroleum and energy products, fish, seafood, alcoholic beverages and non-industrial diamonds. An annex listing the products subject to the higher duty was not immediately available.\n\nUkraine's mission to the EU has said on Twitter that rescuers are trying to extinguish the fire at a Kremenchuk shopping mall that was struck by Russian missiles.\n\n\"Russia's inhumanity has no limits.

However, Moscow has been using them in large numbers for tactical advantage.\n\nThis comes as Ukrainian forces consolidate their positions in the city of Lyschansak after falling back from nearby Sieverodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin promised his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro, that Russia would maintain its delivery of fertilizers to Brazil.

Its last sovereign default was over decades ago, in 1998, after falling oil prices and the collapse of the ruble led to a financial crisis.\n\nThe Kremlin, for its part, has said the default label is artificial, as it has the funds to pay its debt but it was unable to access its foreign reserves due to Western sanctions.\n\n\"There is money and there is also the readiness to pay,\" Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said last month of the looming default, calling the situation \"artificially created\" by \"unfriendly\" powers.\n\nAt least 18 people have now been confirmed dead as emergency workers continue to clear rubble at the Kremenchuk shopping center that was targeted by a Russian airstrike, said Dmytro Lunin, governor of the Poltava region where Kremenchuk is.\n\nThe head of Ukraine's State Emergency Service, Sergiy Kruk, said on Telegram early on Tuesday that workers were still clearing debris from the site and extinguishing the remaining fires.\n\n\"All response groups are working in intense mode,\" Kruk said. \"The work will go on around the clock.\"\n\nGermany's gas storage facilities crossed the 60% mark late Monday, a slight increase from figures reported over the weekend, as the country attempts to ramp up gas reserves ahead of winter.\n\nWith Russian deliveries impacted, the German government is looking to reach at least 90% of storage capacity by the beginning of November. On Monday, figures from Europe's gas infrastructure operator GIE showed German storage facilities were 60.26% full - 0.34% up from Sunday.\n\nThese facilities compensate for potential fluctuations in gas consumption, forming a buffer for the energy market. However, even if the German storage facilities were full by late autumn, reserves would not be enough to carry the country through the winter.\n\nWithout Russian deliveries, the reserves would meet demand for 2.5 months in an average winter, according to Klaus M\u00fcller, the president of the Germany's Federal Network Agency, which regulates essential services like gas supplies.\n\nDmitry Medvedev has threatened to place Iskander hypersonic missiles on NATO's doorstep if Finland and Sweden join the military alliance.\n\nThe former Russian president, who is now deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, made the comment in an interview with Argumenty i Fakty, a government-owned newspaper.\n\nMedvedev said Russia would strengthen its borders and would be \"ready for retaliatory steps\" if the two Nordic countries are admitted into the alliance.\n\nSweden and Finland have both formally applied join NATO last month, pending ongoing talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has threatened to exercise his veto power.\n\nIn the same interview, Medvedev also threatened the prospect of \"World War Three\" if any NATO member were to \"encroach\" on Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.\n\nWorld leaders sharply condemned a deadly Russian missile strike on a crowded shopping center in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk.\n\nIn a joint statement issued late on Monday night, the leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) nations described the strike as a \"brutal\" and \"abominable\" attack.\n\n\"Indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.

(EPA)\n\nRussian forces battled Wednesday to surround the Ukrainian military's last stronghold in a long-contested eastern province, as shock reverberated from a Russian airstrike on a shopping mall that killed at least 18 in the center of the country two days earlier.\n\nMoscow's battle to wrest the entire Donbas region from Ukraine saw Russian forces pushing toward two Luhansk province villages south of the city of Lysychansk while Ukrainian troops fought to prevent their encirclement.\n\nBritain's defense ministry said Russian forces were making \"incremental advances\" in their offensive to capture the city. Lysychansk is the last major area of the province under Ukrainian control following the retreat of Ukraine's forces from the neighboring city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nRussian troops and their separatist allies control 95% of Luhansk and about half of the Donetsk region, the other province that makes up the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas.\n\nThe latest assessment by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said the Ukrainians were likely in a fighting withdrawal to seek more defensible positions while draining the Russian military forces of manpower and resources.\n\nMeanwhile, crews continued to search through the rubble of the shopping mall in Kremenchuk where Ukrainian authorities say 20 people remain missing. Authorities in the city declared three days of mourning.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Services press officer Svitlana Rybalko told The Associated Press that along with the 18 people killed, investigators found fragments of eight more bodies. It was not immediately clear whether that meant there were more victims. A number of survivors suffered severed limbs.\n\n\"The police cannot say for sure how many (victims) there are. So we are finding not the bodies but the fragments of bodies,\" Rybalko said. \"Now we are clearing at the very epicenter of the blast. Here, we practically cannot find bodies as such.\"\n\nSeveral families stood by what was left of the Amstor shopping center Wednesday morning in hope of finding missing loved ones.\n\n\"This is pure genocide,\" local resident Tatiana Chernyshova said while going to lay flowers at the site. \"Such things cannot happen in the 21st century.\"\n\n\"We need to engage everyone to help stop the war, help us fight these scum - these Russian aggressors,\" Chernyshova said.\n\nPsychologists working at the site with families said they were trying to help people come to terms with their loss.\n\n\"We are trying to help them release their emotions now, as later it becomes harder and much more painful,\" said one psychologist, who did not give his name as he was not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nAfter the attack on the mall, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of becoming \"a terrorist\" state. On Wednesday, he reproached NATO for not embracing or equipping his embattled country more fully.\n\n\"The open-door policy of NATO shouldn't resemble old turnstiles on Kyiv's subway, which stay open but close when you approach them until you pay,\" Zelenskyy told NATO leaders meeting in Madrid, speaking by video link. \"Hasn't Ukraine paid enough? Hasn't our contribution to defending Europe and the entire civilization been sufficient?\"\n\nHe asked for more modern artillery systems and other weapons and warned the NATO leaders they either had to provide Ukraine with the help it needed to defeat Russia or \"face a delayed war between Russia and yourself.\"\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Wednesday dismissed what she claimed was the Ukrainian government's \"blatant provocation\" in trying to blame the mall missile strike on Russia's military.\n\nBritain's defense ministry said there was a \"realistic possibility\" that the mall strike \"was intended to hit a nearby infrastructure target.\"\n\n\"Russian planners highly likely remain willing to accept a high level of collateral damage when they perceive military necessity in striking a target,\" the ministry said. \"It is almost certain that Russia will continue to conduct strikes in an effort to interdict the resupplying of Ukrainian front-line forces.\"\n\nRussia's military also is experiencing a shortage of more modern precision strike weapons that is compounding civilian casualties, the British ministry said.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, a Russian missile strike on a multi-story apartment building Wednesday in the city of Mykolaiv killed at least four people and injured five, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said. Mykolaiv is a major port and seizing it - as well as Odesa further west - would be key to Russia's objective of cutting off Ukraine from its Black Sea coast.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said in a statement that the missile strike on Mykolaiv targeted a base for training \"foreign mercenaries,\" as well as ammunition depots.\n\nKyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko on Tuesday urged NATO leaders in Madrid to do whatever it took to stop the war, saying that if Ukraine is defeated, \"you're going to be next.\"", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat English"}, "authors": [{"uri": "asharq_al_awsat@english.aawsat.com", "name": "Asharq Al-Awsat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://english.aawsat.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2022/06/29/_10040472-1656497299.jpg?itok=Olwlcj9T", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 28, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 38, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093677308", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "15:10:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T15:10:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T14:52:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5803921818733215, "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/shopping-centre-kremenchuk-ukraine-hit-russian-putin-missiles-volodymyr-zelensky-b1008673.html", "title": "Shopping centre in Ukraine with 1,000 inside hit by Russian missiles  - Zelensky", "body": "President Volodymyr Zelensky said there were 1,000 civilians in the building at the time of the attack.\n\n\"The mall is on fire, firefighters are trying to extinguish the fire, the number of victims is impossible to imagine,\" the country's leader said on Telegram.\n\nThe mall posed \"no danger to the Russian army\" and posed \"no strategic value\" to the Russians, Mr Zelensky added.\n\n\"It's useless to hope for decency and humanity from Russia,\" he added.\n\nKyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the President's office, said nine of the wounded were in a serious condition following the missile strike.\n\nKremenchuk, an industrial city of 217,000 before Russia's invasion, is the site of Ukraine's biggest oil refinery.", "source": {"uri": "standard.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Evening Standard"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_dex@standard.co.uk", "name": "Robert Dex", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "matt_watts@standard.co.uk", "name": "Matt Watts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/06/27/16/f3b3e604-178a-4f43-8623-1e139461331e.jpg?width=1200&width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 5, "stanza_neu": 2, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 7, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093678313", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "15:10:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T15:10:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T14:53:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5803921818733215, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/27/world/europe/kremenchuk-shopping-center-ukraine.html", "title": "A missile strike hit a shopping center with 1,000 people inside, Zelensky says.", "body": "KYIV, Ukraine -- A shopping center in Ukraine's central Poltava region was hit by a Russian missile strike on Monday afternoon, the Ukrainian authorities said.\n\nAn estimated 1,000 people were inside the building, though the number of casualties is unknown.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there are victims,\" Dmitry Lunin, the governor of the Poltava region, wrote on Telegram, confirming the attack. \"More details later.\"\n\nVideos posted online of the site, near the railway station in the industrial city of Kremenchuk, showed a fire raging as emergency workers worked frantically to try to extinguish the flames.

At least 18 people died and about 60 were wounded in the Monday strike, according to Ukrainian officials, but Russia claims it only hit a legitimate military target near the mall.\n\nVideo from security cameras in the area clearly caught the moment when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says a Russian X-22 cruise missile slammed into the shopping center in the central city of Kremenchuk. A shockwave ripples across the area just before people in a park are seen falling to the ground and fleeing for cover.\n\nEmergency workers were still searching through the wreckage of the shopping center on Wednesday, with about 20 people still listed as missing.\n\nZelenskyy shared another video that he said showed the X-22 rocket -- a long-range cruise missile designed in the former Soviet Union to sink American aircraft carriers -- flying at an angle into the mall, sending a huge fireball and debris flying in all directions.

strikes at the UN Security Council, where Russia wields veto power but has not been able to prevent critical discussion of the invasion.\n\nUS President Joe Biden and his peers from the wealthy Group of Seven nations are seeking to tighten the economic screws on Moscow, even as soaring energy and food prices drive up global inflation.\n\n\"We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,\" the G7 said in a statement on the summit's second day.\n\nZelenskyy, addressing the leaders virtually, had urged them

See below for the latest updates.\n\nThe NATO summit continues in Spain on Wednesday, with a historic deal already under its belt after the alliance reached a deal with Turkey to accept membership bids from Sweden and Finland.\n\nThe two nations moved to join NATO after Russia's invasion of Ukraine raised fears about Russian aggression elsewhere. The summit is arguably the most important meeting of the alliance in recent months, and years.\n\nNATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced earlier in the week that the Western military organization would increase the number of troops within its rapid response force -- which comprises land, air, sea and special forces units that are capable of being deployed quickly -- to 300,000 from about 40,000 personnel.\n\nIn Ukraine, the search and rescue operation following the Russian strike on a shopping mall in central Ukraine continued Tuesday. Twenty people are now confirmed to have died in the strike and at least 59 were injured in the attack.\n\nUkraine's Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky said yesterday that there are no survivors under the rubble of the mall because of the fire that broke out after the missile hit the building.\n\nUkrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskyy has said Russia is responsible for \"state terrorism\" in Ukraine, with over 2,800 Russian missiles having hit its cities so far during the war.\n\nIn his latest address overnight, Zelenskyy said he had taken part in a special meeting of the U.N. Security Council, convened at the request of Ukraine on Tuesday, in order to \"take advantage of all international levers to bring Russia to justice for state terrorism.\"\n\n\"For everything done by the Russian army against Ukrainians in Kremenchuk, in Ochakiv, in Lysychansk, in Kharkiv, in Dnipro, in many, many other cities of Ukraine. As of this evening, the total number of Russian missiles that have hit our cities is already 2,811. And there are many more air bombs, many artillery shells,\" he said.\n\nThe president noted that the U.N. Security Council today stood in silence to commemorate all Ukrainians killed by the Russian army so far during the conflict, noting that \"the members of the Russian delegation looked at everyone present in the Security Council and also decided to stand up ... but everyone knows that it is Russian terror, it is the Russian state that is killing innocent people in this war waged against the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nRussia has again been accused of war crimes after a Russian missile hit a shopping mall in Kremenchuk in central Ukraine. The strike killed at least 20 civilians shopping in the building and injured at least 59 people, with others still missing. Ukraine's interior minister said yesterday that there were no survivors under the rubble because of the fire that spread through the building after the missile strike.\n\nRussia has repeatedly denied that it has targeted civilians or civilian infrastructure despite multiple instances refuting those claims. It has also spread falsehoods and disinformation about such attacks; on Tuesday, Russia said it was targeting a depot of weapons donated by the U.S. and Europe near the mall, a claim dismissed by Ukraine.\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nGermany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has described the situation the country faces as a \"hybrid war,\" with the conflict in Ukraine having deep implications for the energy landscape in Europe, and Germany having to put plans in place in case its gas supplies -- which are supplied via Nord Stream 1 from Russia to Germany -- are cut by Moscow.\n\n\"We are faced now in Germany with the question now that if there's no gas coming through Nord Stream 1 ... we have to decide which institution may be cut off the grid,\" Baerbock told CNBC's Hadley Gamble on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are in a time of war, in Ukraine people are dying, but we are in a hybrid war where the war is also being done [fought] by energy,\" Baerbock said.\n\nGermany is particularly reliant on Russian gas supplies via its Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Before the war, there were plans for this supply to be doubled with a second pipeline, Nord Stream 2, despite misgivings about the pipeline from the United States, Ukraine and other countries in eastern Europe, particularly Poland.\n\nThe giant energy infrastructure project, while fully built and ready to function, has been put on ice -- perhaps permanently -- because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that the world's most powerful military alliance reached a deal to admit Sweden and Finland after resolving the concerns of holdout Turkey.\n\nThe push to add Sweden and Finland to the world's most powerful military alliance comes as Russia's assault on Ukraine amplifies fears of other countries in the region. Moscow, long wary of NATO expansion, has opposed the two nations' plans to join the alliance.\n\nBoth Finland and Sweden already meet many of the requirements to be NATO members. Some of the requirements include having a functioning democratic political system, a willingness to provide economic transparency and the ability to make military contributions to NATO missions.\n\nHowever, all 30 NATO members must approve a country's bid for it to be accepted into the alliance.\n\n-- Amanda Macias\n\nA satellite image by Planet Labs shows the destruction of a shopping mall in Kremenchuk, Ukraine.\n\nOn Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on the Telegram messaging platform that more than 1,000 people were inside at the time of the Russian rocket attack, according to an NBC News report.\n\n\"This is not an off-target missile strike, this is a calculated Russian strike -- exactly at this shopping mall,\" Zelenskyy said in his evening address.\n\nG-7 leaders condemned the Russian missile strike and pledged to hold \"Russian President Putin and those responsible\" to account.\n\nThe Kremlin has previously denied that it targets civilians.\n\n-- Amanda Macias\n\nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said the EU's stocks of gas are increasing as the bloc looks to other suppliers aside from Russia, but added that the region must have contingency plans in case Russia cuts its supplies.\n\n\"There will have to be -- particularly if Russia decides to cut supply altogether -- contingency plans but [gas] stocks are increasing nicely. We've reached a good level of stocks ... and if we complete the stocks we are able to manage this transition to the time when we will be completely independent from Russian gas,\" he told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick at a press conference.\n\nDraghi said Europe had implemented measures to tackle the economic fallout of the conflict including diversifying its suppliers and investing in renewable forms of energy.\n\n\"We went all over [for other suppliers], and we've replaced a good deal of the Russia gas,\" he said, noting that 40% of the EU's gas supplies came from Russia last year, whereas now it was down to 25%.\n\nA recession in Europe on account of the war in Ukraine is not an immediate forecast, Draghi also noted, saying: \"For the time being, the economy of the euro area is slowing down but we don't foresee a recession now. The Italian economy is actually going better than we expected a couple of months ago.\"\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt", "source": {"uri": "nbclosangeles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Southern California"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2022/06/107082329-1656482889349-gettyimages-1241590195-AFP_32DE4XV.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 17, "stanza_neu": 29, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 49, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7095318902", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "19:40:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T19:40:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T19:16:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5803921818733215, "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/hutchinson-large-concern-25th-amendment-191636368.html", "title": "Hutchinson: 'Large concern' about 25th Amendment being invoked in final days of Trump presidency", "body": "Missiles strike Ukraine shopping mall; G7 vows to keep pressure on Russia\n\nKREMENCHUK, Ukraine (Reuters) -Russian missiles struck a crowded shopping mall in central Ukraine on Monday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, as Moscow fought for control of a key eastern city and Western leaders promised to support Kyiv in the war \"as long as it takes\".

It came as an unusually intense barrage of Russian fire all across Ukraine, including in the capital of Kyiv, drew new attention to a war that some fear could fade from the headlines as it drags on.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G-7 summit in Germany, French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven leading industrialized democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\" \"Russia cannot and should not win,\" he said. He added that Monday's attack on the mall was \"a new war crime\".\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian authorities claimed that the mall was not the target.\n\nHow to counter Russia and back Ukraine will be the focus of a summit this week of the western NATO alliance, whose support has been critical to Kyiv's ability to fend off Moscow's larger and better equipped forces. Ukrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to continue to hold off and even drive back Russia, which is pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern region of the Donbas.\n\nAs Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall that authorities said was struck when more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when there was an explosion. The blast knocked her down. When another came about 10 minutes later, she realised she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicentre with all of my strength,\" she said. Fighting back tears, she added: \"You have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said. Several of the bodies of those who didn't make it out in time are burned beyond recognition and their identification could take days, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded. Another 21 people are still missing, Monastyrsky said.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theatre, a train station, and a hospital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history,\" while the G-7 leaders said \"indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.\" At Ukraine's request, the UN Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the attack.\n\nAs condemnation of the strike came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals. He said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognizing its control over territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian Defence Ministry spokesman Lt Gen Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire. Ukrainian officials have contradicted that, saying the mall was hit directly.\n\nKonashenkov said the depot was near a factory for road construction equipment. Mykola Danileiko, a spokesman for that factory, confirmed that it was hit along with the mall, but insisted that there were no weapons there. Wayne Jordash, a British lawyer who is working with Ukrainian officials to investigate possible war crimes, meanwhile, said that initial indications were that there were no military targets nearby, but the investigation is ongoing.\n\nKonashenkov also alleged that the mall was not in use, a false claim contradicted by witnesses.\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity,\" noting that Moscow's military has been \"systematically shelling civilian infrastructure with the aim to scare people, to kill people, to bring terror to our cities and villages\".\n\nVenediktova emphasised the need for Ukrainians across the entire country to remain alert, adding that they should expect a similar strike \"every minute\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. A further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to local officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire in recent days came as the G-7 leaders gathered in Europe. They pledged continued support for Ukraine and the world's major economies prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. The US appeared ready to respond to that call, and NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of its summit as the alliance turns its attention once again to confronting an adversarial Russia.\n\nIn a sinister warning as NATO leaders gathered in Madrid ahead of that summit, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where the meeting will be held.\n\nIt also posted the images and coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin -- referring to them as \"decision-making centres supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app.\n\nThat wording echoes Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier warnings that he could target such centres in response to what he has called aggressive Western actions.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/06/ukraine-10.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 29, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 42, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094228686", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "02:43:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T02:43:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T02:43:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5764706134796143, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/28/world-leaders-condemn-abominable-russian-attack-on-ukraine-shopping-centre", "title": "World leaders condemn 'abominable' Russian attack on Ukraine shopping centre", "body": "G7 leaders say they 'stand united with Ukraine in mourning the innocent victims' of Kremenchuk attack as rescue efforts continue\n\nLeaders around the world have denounced Russia's deadly strike on a shopping centre in Kremenchuk, Ukraine, as \"abominable\" and a war crime, amid growing international outrage at the attack.\n\nRescue efforts are underway and the search for survivors continues after the missile strike on a busy shopping centre in central Ukraine that had more than 1,000 people in it at the time, according to President Volodoymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nThe Ukrainian defence ministry said the strike was deliberately timed to coincide with the mall's busiest hours and cause the maximum number of victims.\n\nSo far, 16 people are known to have been killed and 59 injured, Serhiy Kruk, the head of Ukraine's state emergency service, said early on Tuesday.

Russian president Putin and those responsible will be held to account.\n\n\"Today, we underlined our unwavering support for Ukraine in the face of the Russian aggression, an unjustified war of choice that has been raging for 124 days.\"\n\nThey said they would \"continue to provide financial, humanitarian as well as military support for Ukraine, for as long as it takes\".\n\n\"We will not rest until Russia ends its cruel and senseless war on Ukraine.\"\n\nSeparately, French president Emmanuel Macron called the attack an \"abomination\", saying: \"We share the pain of the victims' families, and the anger in the face of such an atrocity. The Russian people have to see the truth:\"\n\nUN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said: \"It is deplorable, to say the least. Any sort of civilian infrastructure, which includes obviously shopping malls, and civilians should never ever be targeted.\"\n\nUkraine's air force command said Russia hit the mall, which is located near a railway station, with two X-22 cruise missiles that were fired by an unspecified number of Tu-22M long-range bombers.\n\nImages from the scene showed giant plumes of black smoke and flames, with emergency crews rushing in to search for victims. It took 300 emergency workers more than four hours to extinguish the flames.\n\nMykola Lukash, from the Kremenchuk district prosecutor's office, said cranes would be brought in on Tuesday to help lift the collapsed roof of the shopping centre. \"We haven't found any children's bodies. A lot of bodies are burnt. We need to carry out DNA tests.\"\n\nSpeaking at 2am local time on Tuesday, emergency services chief Kruk said work was continuing at the site. He said: \"The main tasks currently performed by rescuers are to carry out rescue operations, dismantle debris and eliminate fires. So far, 16 people have been killed and 59 injured, 25 of whom have been hospitalised.\"\n\nZelenskiy said on Telegram that the number of victims was \"unimaginable\". He wrote: \"The occupiers fired missiles at the shopping centre, where there were more than a thousand civilians. The mall is on fire, rescuers are extinguishing the fire, the number of victims is unimaginable. Russia continues to take out its impotence on ordinary citizens. It is useless to hope for decency and humanity from Russia.\"\n\nOn Monday night, emergency workers and soldiers continued to comb through blackened debris and twisted metal. \"We pulled out several bodies, but there are definitely more trapped under the rubble,\" said Oleksii, 46, a firefighter. \"This is normally a very crowded place.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lorenzo_tondo@theguardian.com", "name": "Lorenzo Tondo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "pjotr_sauer@theguardian.com", "name": "Pjotr Sauer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e52d9cffa30c3097f6cb3d4cf83a4376478f927/0_272_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=7c143c6375729aabf67f8e3510f12190", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 14, "stanza_neu": 20, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 35, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093720424", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "15:44:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T15:44:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T15:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5764706134796143, "url": "https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-russia-ukraine-war-russian-missile-strikes-crowded-ukrainian-mall-killing-at-least-2-2963960", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war: Russian missile strikes crowded Ukrainian mall, killing at least 2", "body": "A Russian missile strike hit a crowded shopping centre in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk on Monday, killing at least two people and wounding 20, senior Ukrainian officials said.\n\nAlso, READ: Russia defaults on foreign debt for first time in a century\n\nFootage circulated by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy showed a huge blaze raging in a sprawling building and dark smoke billowing into the sky as onlookers stood outside.

It was part of an unusually intense barrage of Russian fire across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv, that renewed international attention as the war drags on.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G-7 summit in Germany, French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven leading industrialised democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\"\n\n\"Russia cannot and should not win,\" he said. He called Monday's attack on the shopping centre\"a new war crime.\"\n\n* Misinformation is a threat and affecting NZ, Jacinda Ardern says ahead of Nato speech\n\n* What will the Nato summit seek to address?\n\n* Nato to boost rapid reaction force, Ukraine military support\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian officials claimed the shopping centre was not the target.\n\nIn a virtual address to the UN Security Council, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being a \"terrorist\" and called for Russia to be expelled from the United Nations. He also urged the UN to establish an international tribunal to investigate Russia's action in Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy ended his address by asking all in the chamber to stand in silent tribute to the \"tens of thousands\" of Ukrainian children and adults killed in the war. All council members rose, including Russia's deputy UN ambassador Dmitry Polyansky.\n\nHow to counter Russia and back Ukraine will also be the focus of a summit this week of the Nato alliance, whose support has been critical to Kyiv's ability to fend off Moscow's larger and better equipped forces. Ukrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to hold off and even drive back Russia, which is pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.\n\nAs Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping centre, which officials said was struck when more than 1000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the shopping centre when an explosion knocked her down. When another blast came about 10 minutes later, she realised she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicentre with all of my strength,\" she said. Fighting back tears, she added: \"You have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping centre.\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said. Several of the bodies of those who didn't make it out in time are burned beyond recognition, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded, while 21 people were still missing.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theatre, a train station, and a hospital. Zelenskyy called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\"\n\nRocket attacks continued elsewhere in Ukraine, with authorities in the city of Dnipro reporting that workers at a diesel car repair shop were trapped in rubble after a strike from a cruise missile fired from the Black Sea, Ukrainian news agencies reported. The Ukrainian military managed to intercept and destroy other missiles fired at the city, the agencies said.\n\nAs condemnation came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfils its goals. He said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognising its control over territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian Defence Ministry spokesman Lt Gen Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the shopping centre on fire. Ukrainian authorities said that in addition to the direct hit on the shopping centre, a factory was struck, but denied it housed weapons.\n\nKonashenkov also falsely alleged that the shopping centre was not in use.\n\nOne survivor, Oleksandr, an employee in the shopping centre, told the AP from a hospital bed that the shopping centre was packed with customers. He recalled stepping outside with a colleague for a cigarette when the air raid siren went off.\n\n\"There was a black tunnel, smoke, fire,\" he said. \"I started to crawl. I saw the sun up there, and my brain was telling me I needed to save myself.\"\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity.\" She emphasised the need for all Ukrainians to remain alert and expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. Six more people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire came as the G-7 leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defence systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. Nato's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of a summit starting this week in Madrid, and an early signal of unity came Tuesday when Turkey agreed to lift its opposition to Sweden and Finland joining Nato.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine prompted the two Nordic countries to abandon their long-held nonaligned status and apply to join Nato. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had blocked the move, insisting they change their stance on Kurdish rebel groups that Turkey considers terrorists.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the West that \"the more weapons are pumped into Ukraine, the longer the conflict will continue and the longer the agony of the Nazi regime backed by Western capitals will last.\"\n\nRussia has falsely called the war a campaign to \"de-Nazify\" Ukraine - a country with a democratically elected Jewish president who wants closer ties with the West.\n\nIn a sinister message to Nato leaders, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where their summit will be held.\n\nIt also posted images and the coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin - referring to them as \"decision-making centres supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app. That wording echoes Putin's warnings that he could target such centres in response to what he has called Western aggression.", "source": {"uri": "stuff.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stuff"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yuras_karmanau@stuff.co.nz", "name": "Yuras Karmanau", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/4/y/z/f/k/c/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.4yzfjt.png/1656462076483.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 39, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 53, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7095004927", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "14:47:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T14:47:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T14:46:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "url": "http://www.uniindia.com/news/world/18-died-in-missile-strike-on-ukrainian-mall/2767883.html", "title": "18 died in missile strike on Ukrainian mall", "body": "Kyiv, June 28 (UNI) At least 18 people have died in a missile strike on a shopping center in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk.\n\nOn Monday, some 1,000 civilians were estimated to be inside the busy mall at the time of the attack at around 15:50 (12:50 GMT), BBC report quoted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as saying.\n\nZelensky described the attack as one of the \"most brazen terrorist acts in European history\".\n\nHe said the mall had no strategic value to Russia and posed no danger to its forces -

Russian forces battled Wednesday to surround the Ukrainian military's last stronghold in a long-contested eastern province, as shock reverberated from a Russian airstrike on a shopping mall that killed at least 18 in the centre of the country two days earlier.\n\nKremenchuk (Ukraine), Jun 30 (AP) Russian forces battled Wednesday to surround the Ukrainian military's last stronghold in a long-contested eastern province, as shock reverberated from a Russian airstrike on a shopping mall that killed at least 18 in the centre of the country two days earlier.\n\nMoscow's battle to wrest the entire Donbas region from Ukraine saw Russian forces pushing toward two villages south of Lysychansk while Ukrainian troops fought to prevent their encirclement.\n\nAlso Read | UK PM Boris Johnson Says if Vladimir Putin Was a Woman He Would Not Have Started Such 'Macho War' in Ukraine.\n\nBritain's defense ministry said Russian forces were making \"incremental advances\" in their offensive to capture Lysychansk, the last city in the Luhansk province under Ukrainian control following the retreat of Ukraine's forces from the neighbouring city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nRussian troops and their separatist allies control 95% of Luhansk and about half of Donetsk, the two provinces that make up the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas.\n\nAlso Read | US President Joe Biden Announces US Reinforcement of NATO Forces in Europe To Meet Threats Amid Russia-Ukraine Conflict.\n\nThe latest assessment by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said the Ukrainians were likely in a fighting withdrawal to seek more defensible positions while draining the Russian forces of manpower and resources.\n\nAvril Haines, the U.S. director of national intelligence, said Russia \"may think time is on its side\" due to the escalating costs borne by the West and fatigue as the war grows longer. The most likely scenario predicted by American intelligence, Haines said, is a \"grinding struggle\" in which Russia consolidates its hold over southern Ukraine by the fall.\n\nThe US correctly predicted Russia would invade Ukraine in February, but was wrong in assessing that it would quickly seize Kyiv. Speaking at an event in Washington on Wednesday, Haines said Russian President Vladimir Putin \"has effectively the same political goals that he had previously, which is to say that he wants to take most of Ukraine\" and push it away from NATO.\n\n\"We perceive a disconnect between Putin's near-term military objectives in this area and his military's capacity, a kind of mismatch between his ambitions and what the military is able to accomplish,\" Haines said.\n\nMeanwhile, crews continued to search through the rubble of the shopping mall in Kremenchuk where Ukrainian authorities say 20 people remain missing.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Services press officer Svitlana Rybalko told The Associated Press that along with the 18 people killed, investigators found fragments of eight more bodies. It was not immediately clear whether that meant there were more victims. A number of survivors suffered severed limbs.\n\n\"The police cannot say for sure how many (victims) there are. So we are finding not the bodies but the fragments of bodies,\" Rybalko said. \"Now we are clearing at the very epicentre of the blast. Here, we practically cannot find bodies as such.\"\n\nSeveral families stood by what was left of the Amstor shopping centre Wednesday morning in hope of finding missing loved ones.\n\n\"This is pure genocide,\" local resident Tatiana Chernyshova said while going to lay flowers at the site. \"Such things cannot happen in the 21st century.\"\n\n\"We need to engage everyone to help stop the war, help us fight these scum -- these Russian aggressors,\" Chernyshova said.\n\nPsychologists working at the site with families said they were trying to help people come to terms with their loss.\n\n\"We are trying to help them release their emotions now, as later it becomes harder and much more painful,\" said one psychologist, who did not give his name as he was not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nAfter the attack on the mall, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of becoming a \"terrorist\" state. On Wednesday, he reproached NATO for not embracing or equipping his embattled country more fully.\n\n\"The open-door policy of NATO shouldn't resemble old turnstiles on Kyiv's subway, which stay open but close when you approach them until you pay,\" Zelenskyy told NATO leaders meeting in Madrid, speaking by video link. \"Hasn't Ukraine paid enough? Hasn't our contribution to defending Europe and the entire civilization been sufficient?\"\n\nHe asked for more modern artillery systems and other weapons and warned the NATO leaders they either had to provide Ukraine with the help it needed to defeat Russia or \"face a delayed war between Russia and yourself.\"\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Wednesday dismissed what she claimed was the Ukrainian government's \"blatant provocation\" in trying to blame the mall missile strike on Russia's military.\n\nBritain's defense ministry said there was a \"realistic possibility\" that the mall strike \"was intended to hit a nearby infrastructure target.\"\n\n\"Russian planners highly likely remain willing to accept a high level of collateral damage when they perceive military necessity in striking a target,\" the ministry said. \"It is almost certain that Russia will continue to conduct strikes in an effort to interdict the resupplying of Ukrainian front-line forces.\"\n\nRussia's military also is experiencing a shortage of more modern precision strike weapons, which is compounding civilian casualties, the British ministry said.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, a Russian missile strike on a multi-story apartment building Wednesday in Mykolaiv killed at least four people and injured five, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said in a statement that the missile strike on Mykolaiv targeted a base for training \"foreign mercenaries,\" as well as ammunition depots.

Information on the number of victims is being updated,\" Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Russia.\n\nRussian artillery was also pounding Lysychansk, just across the Siverskyi Donets River from now-ruined Severodonetsk.\n\nLuhansk province governor Serhiy Gaidai said Lysychansk was suffering \"catastrophic\" damage.

Mykolaiv is a major port and seizing it -- as well as Odesa farther west -- would be key to Russia's objective of cutting off Ukraine from its Black Sea coast.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said in a statement that the missile strike on Mykolaiv targeted a base for training \"foreign mercenaries,\" as well as ammunition depots.\n\nIn other developments Wednesday:\n\n-- A senior Russian lawmaker warned that Lithuania's refusal to allow some goods targeted by European Union sanctions through to Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad could trigger a military confrontation.\n\nThe statement by Vladimir Dzhabarov, a deputy head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of Russia's parliament, followed the Kremlin's warning that it will retaliate against restrictions of transit to Kaliningrad. The region borders EU and NATO members Poland and Lithuania.\n\n-- Russia's foreign ministry summoned Norway's charge d'affaires to protest Oslo's blocking of a shipment of supplies to a Russian coal-mining town in the Svalbard islands.\n\nAlthough the Svalbards are Norwegian territory, a 1920 treaty allows all signatory countries the right to exploit its natural resources. Russia operates a coal mine in Barentsburg, a settlement of about 450 people, which relies on shipments from the mainland of food, machinery and other supplies. Norway imposed sanctions on shipments from Russia in April.\n\n-- Ukrainian military intelligence says that in the largest prisoner swap since the start of the war 144 Ukrainian troops were released from Russian captivity. Of those released, 95 were involved in defending the Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's devastated southern city of Mariupol before Russian forces captured it weeks ago. Denis Pushilin, the separatist leader in Donetsk, said an equal number of soldiers was released by both sides.\n\n-- European Union leaders approved a 600-million euro ($631 million) package to address food security issues brought on by the Ukrainian war in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.\n\n-- British businessman Richard Branson met with Zelenskyy in Kyiv and also visited the Hostomel airport outside the city. Zelenskyy said Branson, whose Virgin Group includes an airline, may be interested in rebuilding the airport, which was badly damaged early in the war.\n\n-- Britain is imposing sanctions on Russia's second-richest man and on a cousin of Putin's. Vladimir Potanin, owner of the Interross conglomerate, has continued to amass wealth while backing Putin, acquiring Rosbank and shares in Tinkoff Bankonith in the period following the invasion of Ukraine, a U.K. government statement said Wednesday.\n\nThe statement said Putin's cousin, Anna Tsivileva, and her husband, Sergey Tsivilev, have \"significantly benefited\" from their relationship with Putin. Tsivileva is president of the JSC Kolmar Group coal mining company, and Tsivilev is governor of the coal-rich Kemerovo region.\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

The most likely scenario predicted by American intelligence, Haines said, is a \"grinding struggle\" in which Russia consolidates its hold over southern Ukraine by the fall.\n\nThe U.S. correctly predicted Russia would invade Ukraine in February, but was wrong in assessing that it would quickly seize Kyiv. Speaking at an event in Washington on Wednesday, Haines said Russian President Vladimir Putin \"has effectively the same political goals that he had previously, which is to say that he wants to take most of Ukraine\" and push it away from NATO.\n\n\"We perceive a disconnect between Putin's near-term military objectives in this area and his military's capacity, a kind of mismatch between his ambitions and what the military is able to accomplish,\" Haines said.\n\nMeanwhile, crews continued to search through the rubble of the shopping mall in Kremenchuk where Ukrainian authorities say 20 people remain missing.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Services press officer Svitlana Rybalko told The Associated Press that along with the 18 people killed, investigators found fragments of eight more bodies. It was not immediately clear whether that meant there were more victims. A number of survivors suffered severed limbs.\n\n\"The police cannot say for sure how many (victims) there are. So we are finding not the bodies but the fragments of bodies,\" Rybalko said. \"Now we are clearing at the very epicenter of the blast. Here, we practically cannot find bodies as such.\"\n\nSeveral families stood by what was left of the Amstor shopping center Wednesday morning in hope of finding missing loved ones.\n\n\"This is pure genocide,\" local resident Tatiana Chernyshova said while going to lay flowers at the site. \"Such things cannot happen in the 21st century.\"\n\n\"We need to engage everyone to help stop the war, help us fight these scum -- these Russian aggressors,\" Chernyshova said.\n\nPsychologists working at the site with families said they were trying to help people come to terms with their loss.\n\n\"We are trying to help them release their emotions now, as later it becomes harder and much more painful,\" said one psychologist, who did not give his name as he was not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nAfter the attack on the mall, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of becoming a \"terrorist\" state. On Wednesday, he reproached NATO for not embracing or equipping his embattled country more fully.\n\n\"The open-door policy of NATO shouldn't resemble old turnstiles on Kyiv's subway, which stay open but close when you approach them until you pay,\" Zelenskyy told NATO leaders meeting in Madrid, speaking by video link. \"Hasn't Ukraine paid enough? Hasn't our contribution to defending Europe and the entire civilization been sufficient?\"\n\nHe asked for more modern artillery systems and other weapons and warned the NATO leaders they either had to provide Ukraine with the help it needed to defeat Russia or \"face a delayed war between Russia and yourself.\"\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Wednesday dismissed what she claimed was the Ukrainian government's \"blatant provocation\" in trying to blame the mall missile strike on Russia's military.\n\nBritain's defense ministry said there was a \"realistic possibility\" that the mall strike \"was intended to hit a nearby infrastructure target.\"\n\n\"Russian planners highly likely remain willing to accept a high level of collateral damage when they perceive military necessity in striking a target,\" the ministry said. \"It is almost certain that Russia will continue to conduct strikes in an effort to interdict the resupplying of Ukrainian front-line forces.\"\n\nRussia's military also is experiencing a shortage of more modern precision strike weapons, which is compounding civilian casualties, the British ministry said.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, a Russian missile strike on a multi-story apartment building Wednesday in the city of Mykolaiv killed at least four people and injured five, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said. Mykolaiv is a major port and seizing it -- as well as Odesa farther west -- would be key to Russia's objective of cutting off Ukraine from its Black Sea coast.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said in a statement that the missile strike on Mykolaiv targeted a base for training \"foreign mercenaries,\" as well as ammunition depots.\n\nIn other developments Wednesday:\n\n-- A senior Russian lawmaker warned that Lithuania's refusal to allow some goods targeted by European Union sanctions through to Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad could trigger a military confrontation.\n\nThe statement by Vladimir Dzhabarov, a deputy head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of Russia's parliament, followed the Kremlin's warning that it will retaliate against restrictions of transit to Kaliningrad. The region borders EU and NATO members Poland and Lithuania.\n\n-- Russia's foreign ministry summoned Norway's charge d'affaires to protest Oslo's blocking of a shipment of supplies to a Russian coal-mining town in the Svalbard islands.\n\nAlthough the Svalbards are Norwegian territory, a 1920 treaty allows all signatory countries the right to exploit its natural resources. Russia operates a coal mine in Barentsburg, a settlement of about 450 people, which relies on shipments from the mainland of food, machinery and other supplies. Norway imposed sanctions on shipments from Russia in April.\n\n-- Ukrainian military intelligence says that in the largest prisoner swap since the start of the war 144 Ukrainian troops were released from Russian captivity. Of those released, 95 were involved in defending the Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's devastated southern city of Mariupol before Russian forces captured it weeks ago. Denis Pushilin, the separatist leader in Donetsk, said an equal number of soldiers was released by both sides.\n\n-- European Union leaders approved a 600-million euro ($631 million) package to address food security issues brought on by the Ukrainian war in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.\n\n-- British businessman Richard Branson met with Zelenskyy in Kyiv and also visited the Hostomel airport outside the city. Zelenskyy said Branson, whose Virgin Group includes an airline, may be interested in rebuilding the airport, which was badly damaged early in the war.\n\n-- Britain is imposing sanctions on Russia's second-richest man and on a cousin of Putin's. Vladimir Potanin, owner of the Interross conglomerate, has continued to amass wealth while backing Putin, acquiring Rosbank and shares in Tinkoff Bankonith in the period following the invasion of Ukraine, a U.K. government statement said Wednesday.\n\nThe statement said Putin's cousin, Anna Tsivileva, and her husband, Sergey Tsivilev, have \"significantly benefited\" from their relationship with Putin. Tsivileva is president of the JSC Kolmar Group coal mining company, and Tsivilev is governor of the coal-rich Kemerovo region.\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

He also denounced a missile strike on a crowded mall in central Ukraine, blamed on Russia, as an \"abomination\". His comments came as G7 leaders wrapped up a two-day meeting in Germany.\n\nLeaders of the world's wealthiest nations struck a united stance on Tuesday, promising \"to provide financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,\" as Russia's invasion entered its fifth month.\n\nThe final statement Tuesday from the Group of Seven summit in Germany underlined their intent to impose \"severe and immediate economic costs\" on Russia, maintaining sanctions on Moscow \"for as long as necessary, acting in unison at every stage\".\n\nMacron said he did not see the war in Ukraine coming to an end in the next few weeks or even months, but that he hoped it would be over by year-end.\n\n\"Russia cannot and must not win this war,\" he said, noting the West would continue to make Russian President Vladimir Putin pay a high price for his invasion of Ukraine through sanctions, arms deliveries to Kyiv and possibly also by capping Russian oil prices.\n\nThe G7 also vowed that Putin and those responsible would be held to account for an attack on a shopping mall in the city of Kremenchuk, which killed at least 18 people on Monday.\n\n\"Indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime,\" the G7 leaders said in a statement condemning the \"abominable attack,\" which targeted during its busiest hours.\n\n\"We share the pain of the victims' families, and the anger against such a despicable act. The Russian people must know the truth,\" Macron wrote on Twitter. The message was published in French, English and Russian.\n\nUkraine accused Russia of deliberately targeting civilians, with President Volodymyr Zelensky calling it \"one of the most brazen terrorist acts in European history\" in his evening broadcast posted on Telegram.\n\n\"A peaceful town, an ordinary shopping centre - women, children ordinary civilians inside,\" said Zelensky, who earlier shared a video of the mall engulfed in flames with dozens of rescuers and a fire truck outside.\n\nRussia's defence ministry on Tuesday said it fired missiles at a weapons depot in Kremenchuk, with the subsequent explosion of ammunition triggering a fire in the nearby shopping mall, which they described as \"non-functioning\".\n\nDiplomats said Ukraine requested a Tuesday meeting on the strikes at the UN Security Council, where Russia wields veto power but has not been able to prevent critical discussion of the invasion.\n\nLeaders earlier agreed on a ban on imports of Russian gold and to step up aid to countries hit with food shortages by the blockage on Ukraine grain shipments through the Black Sea.\n\nThe proposed price cap on Russian oil would in theory work by barring service providers such as shippers or insurers from dealing with oil priced above a fixed level. That could work because the service providers are mostly located in the European Union or the UK and thus within reach of sanctions.\n\nTo be effective, however, it would have to involve as many consuming countries as possible, particularly India, where refiners have been snapping up the cheap Russian oil shunned by Western traders.\n\nTo help bring down surging prices, France urged

Ukrainian authorities confirmed there are no military targets in the vicinity and the strike was designed purely to inflict terror on Ukraine's civilian population.\n\n\"Today's attack on the shopping mall in Kremenchuk is one of the most defiant terrorist attacks in European history. A peaceful shopping mall with women, children, ordinary citizens inside,\" Zelenskiy said. \"Only insane terrorists who should have no place on earth, can strike missiles at such an object.\"\n\nThe president went on to emphasise that the strike was a deliberate targeting of civilians and said that he had appealed to the US to classify Russia a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\n\"Russia will stop at nothing. This morning I called on the State Department of America to recognise Russia as a state that sponsors terrorism. The relevant resolution is approved by the US Senate Committee, and the legal decision can be adopted by the Department of State. Such a decision is clearly needed, and it must be supported by the entire democratic world.\"\n\nAt least a dozen people were killed, and more than three dozen injured after Russian missiles slammed into a packed supermarket in the middle of the day on June 27.\n\nZelenskiy tweeted that there were more than 1,000 people shopping in the mall when Russian missiles struck the building, setting it on fire and causing the roof to collapse on customers still trapped inside.\n\nEmergency services were quickly on the scene attempting to pull survivors from the rubble in an ongoing operation.

Rosemary DiCarlo, undersecretary-general for political and peacebuilding affairs, said the true toll was \"considerably higher.\"\n\nIn addition to the 18 confirmed dead in the missile strike on the shopping center, dozens were injured and many are still missing, authorities said on June 28.\n\nRegional Governor Dmytro Lunyn said the mall was \"completely destroyed\" by the missile strike, which Ukraine said was fired from Tu-22 long-range bombers.\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven (G7) nations pledged on the last day of a summit in Germany to support Kyiv for \"as long as it takes\" as the war grinds on.\n\nThe G7 leaders agreed that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"must not win this war, and we will continue to keep up and drive higher the economic and political costs for President Putin and his regime,\" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a closing news conference.\n\n\"For that, it is important to stand together -- including in the long haul that we certainly still face.\"\n\nSpeaking at the end of the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed that the seven leading industrialized democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\"\n\nHe called the attack on the shopping center \"a new war crime\" and said \"Russia cannot and should not win\" the war.\n\nIn another strike reported on June 28, Russian missiles hit in the city of Dnipro, the regional governor said. Fire broke out as a result of the strike, and rescuers were searching for people under the rubble, said a spokeswoman for emergency services in the Dnipropetrovsk region.\n\nThe missile hit a transport company, destroying 21 cars and 13 trucks, the spokeswoman said. A second missile hit an industrial enterprise, damaging several buildings.\n\nThe head of the Luhansk regional military administration, Serhiy Hayday said that Ukrainian defenders will try to hold the line against Russian forces in the east as they look to buy time until the arrival of Western weapons.\n\nRussian forces were trying to storm Lysychansk, which lies across the Siverskiy Donets River from Syevyerodonetsk, to complete their capture of Luhansk in the Donbas region.\n\nTo the west of Lysychansk, the mayor of Slovyansk said Russian forces fired cluster munitions, including one that hit a residential neighborhood. Authorities said the number of victims had yet to be confirmed.\n\nSeparately, Zelenskiy said he had told NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg that his country needs missile defense systems to prevent Russian attacks.\n\nBritain's Ministry of Defense said in its daily intelligence bulletin on June 28 that Ukrainian forces continued to consolidate their positions on higher ground in Lysychansk, after abandoning its twin city, Syevyerodonetsk, to the Russians.\n\nThe bulletin said Ukrainian forces continued to disrupt the Russians' command and control with successful strikes deep behind Russian lines.\n\nBritish intelligence assessed that Russian forces in the Donbas are increasingly \"hollowed out\" and their combat effectiveness has been degraded -- a situation that is \"probably unsustainable\" in the long term.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty"}, "authors": [], "image":

He added that Monday's attack on the shopping centre was \"a new war crime\".\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian authorities claimed that the shopping centre was not the target.\n\nHow to counter Russia and back Ukraine will be the focus of a summit this week of the western Nato alliance, whose support has been critical to Kyiv's ability to fend off Moscow's larger and better equipped forces.\n\nUkrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to continue to hold off and even drive back Russia, which is pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern region of the Donbas.\n\nAs Mr Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping centre that authorities said was struck with more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers inside.\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian interior minister Denis Monastyrsky said.\n\nSeveral of the bodies of those who did not make it out in time are burned beyond recognition and their identification could take days, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded. Another 21 people are still missing, Mr Monastyrsky said.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theatre, a train station, and a hospital.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history\", while the G7 leaders said \"indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime\".\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the UN Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the attack.\n\nAs condemnation of the strike came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfils its goals.\n\nHe said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognising its control over territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian defence ministry spokesman Lt Gen Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire.\n\nUkrainian officials have contradicted that, saying the shopping centre was hit directly.\n\nLt Gen Konashenkov said the depot was near a factory for road construction equipment.\n\nMykola Danileiko, a spokesman for that factory, confirmed that it was hit along with the mall, but insisted that there were no weapons there.\n\nWayne Jordash, a British lawyer who is working with Ukrainian officials to investigate possible war crimes, meanwhile, said that initial indications were that there were no military targets nearby, but the investigation is ongoing.\n\nElsewhere on Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a six-year-old child.\n\nA further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a three-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to local officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire in recent days came as the G7 leaders gathered in Europe. They pledged continued support for Ukraine and the world's major economies prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nMr Zelensky has called for more air defence systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. The US appeared ready to respond to that call, and Nato's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of its summit as the alliance turns its attention once again to confronting an adversarial Russia.\n\nIn a sinister warning as Nato leaders gathered in Madrid ahead of that summit, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where the meeting will be held.\n\nIt also posted the images and coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin -- referring to them as \"decision-making centres supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app.\n\nThat wording echoes Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier warnings that he could target such centres in response to what he has called aggressive Western actions.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.independent.ie/world-news/690e2/41798710.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/ipanews_cbb5b762-82b5-4602-b308-f87469f6d1d8_1", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 23, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 36, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7096856205", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-29", "time": "22:52:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-29T22:52:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-29T22:46:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5490196347236633, "url": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/2022/06/29/breaking-news/russians-fight-to-encircle-ukraines-last-eastern-stronghold/", "title": "Russians fight to encircle Ukraine's last eastern stronghold", "body": "Ukrainian emergency service personnel help an injured local resident after Russian shelling in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, today.\n\nKREMENCHUK, Ukraine >> Russian forces battled Wednesday to surround the Ukrainian military's last stronghold in a long-contested eastern province, as shock reverberated from a Russian airstrike on a shopping mall that killed at least 18 in the center of the country two days earlier.\n\nMoscow's battle to wrest the entire Donbas region from Ukraine saw Russian forces pushing toward two villages south of Lysychansk while Ukrainian troops fought to prevent their encirclement.\n\nBritain's defense ministry said Russian forces were making \"incremental advances\" in their offensive to capture Lysychansk, the last city in the Luhansk province under Ukrainian control following the retreat of Ukraine's forces from the neighboring city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nRussian troops and their separatist allies control 95% of Luhansk and about half of Donetsk, the two provinces that make up the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas.\n\nThe latest assessment by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said the Ukrainians were likely in a fighting withdrawal to seek more defensible positions while draining the Russian forces of manpower and resources.\n\nAvril Haines, the U.S. director of national intelligence, said Russia \"may think time is on its side\" due to the escalating costs borne by the West and fatigue as the war grows longer.

See below for the latest updates.\n\nThe NATO summit continues in Spain on Wednesday, with a historic deal already under its belt after the alliance reached a deal with Turkey to accept membership bids from Sweden and Finland.\n\nThe two nations moved to join NATO after Russia's invasion of Ukraine raised fears about Russian aggression elsewhere. The summit is arguably the most important meeting of the alliance in recent months, and years.\n\nNATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced earlier in the week that the Western military organization would increase the number of troops within its rapid response force -- which comprises land, air, sea and special forces units that are capable of being deployed quickly -- to 300,000 from about 40,000 personnel.\n\nIn Ukraine, the search and rescue operation following the Russian strike on a shopping mall in central Ukraine continued Tuesday. Twenty people are now confirmed to have died in the strike and at least 59 were injured in the attack.\n\nUkraine's Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky said yesterday that there are no survivors under the rubble of the mall because of the fire that broke out after the missile hit the building.\n\nRussia's shortage of more modern precision strike weapons and the professional shortcomings of their targeting planners will highly likely result in further civilian casualties like those caused by Russia's deadly strike on a Ukrainian shopping mall on Monday, the U.K. said on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.K.'s defense ministry said in its latest intelligence update that while there was a \"realistic possibility\" that Russia was targeting some kind of infrastructure target in the strike, it was not the first time that its targeting had been inaccurate, nor was it likely to be the last.\n\n\"Russia's inaccuracy in conducting long range strikes has previously resulted in mass civilian casualty incidents, including at Kramatorsk railway station on 9 April 2022,\" the ministry said on Twitter.\n\n\"Russian planners highly likely remain willing to accept a high level of collateral damage when they perceive military necessity in striking a target,\" it added, noting that \"it is almost certain that Russia will continue to conduct strikes in an effort to interdict the resupplying of Ukrainian frontline forces.\"\n\nThe strike on the Amstor shopping mall in the Poltava province in central Ukraine on Monday killed at least 20 people and injured many others. Ukraine released footage of the strike last night:\n\nIt was decried as a war crime by the G-7 leaders who met earlier this week as the strike took place, but Russia said it was aiming at a nearby depot which is said contained Western arms given to Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian officials believe a Kh-22 missile was used in the strike although this has not been independently confirmed. Kh-22s are Soviet-era, long-range, anti-ship missiles that were first used in the 1960s. Military experts believe Russian forces could be turning to older, less accurate missiles as its stockpile of more modern ones runs low.\n\n- Holly Ellyatt\n\nUkraine's government has released footage showing the missile that hit the Amstor shopping mall in the city of Kremenchuk in central Ukraine on Monday, a strike that killed at least 20 people and injured 59 others.\n\nThe video, which shows CCTV footage from a machinery plant near the mall on Monday, was shown in Ukraine's President Zelenskyy nightly address on Tuesday, and posted on Facebook.\n\nCNBC has not been able to independently verify that the missile is a Kh-22 as stated in the tweet, and has been stated by several Ukrainian officials.\n\nKh-22 missiles are large, long-range anti-ship missiles that were developed by the Soviet Union and first used in the early 1960s, intended for use against U.S. Navy aircraft carriers in the Cold War.\n\nThe strike on the shopping mall was condemned as a war crime by Western leaders. For its part, Russia said it was targeting a depot of weapons donated by the U.S. and Europe that it said was located near the mall, a claim dismissed by Ukraine.\n\n- Holly Ellyatt\n\nAt least 4,731 civilians have been killed since the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, though the actual figures likely to be far higher given the difficult nature of gathering accurate data during periods of war.\n\nMatilda Bogner, head of the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, said on Wednesday morning at a presentation on the human rights situation in the country that \"civilians continue to bear the brunt of hostilities\" in Ukraine.\n\nBogner said more than 10,000 people have been officially documented as being killed or injured, including several hundred children, between the start of the conflict on Feb. 24 and May 15. The data is largely based on field visits and interviews with victims and witnesses of human rights violations.\n\n\"I stress that the actual figures are considerably higher,\" she added.\n\nRussia attacks on civilian infrastructure, from homes to educational and places of worship, did not comply with international humanitarian law, Bognor said. On a much lower scale, it also appears that Ukrainian armed forces did not comply with the law in eastern parts of the country, she added.\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nThe NATO summit taking place in Madrid will be a historic one, its Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday, with a deal on the table to admit new members and a proposal of a new \"strategic concept\" which would be a blueprint to, he said, \"take NATO into the future in a more competitive and dangerous world.\"\n\nWith the alliance set to shift its defenses, Stoltenberg said the summit would be a \"historic and transformative\" for the alliance.\n\nNATO has already reached a deal to allow Sweden and Finland to join the alliance after Turkey dropped its opposition to the bid. It has also already announced that it will massively increase its rapid response force to 300,000, up from a current level of around 40,000 troops.\n\nAs he spoke to the press after arriving at the summit Wednesday, CNBC's Hadley Gamble asked Stoltenberg about the timeline and structure of those additional troops.\n\n\"I expect them to be available and ready next year, that's the plan. Those forces will be paid for and organized by the different allied NATO countries,\" he noted, and would then be pre-assigned to specific NATO territories, most in the eastern part of the alliance, where they would train and become experienced with that terrain.\n\nPre-positioned heavy equipment and pre-assigned forces in certain countries would allow NATO to strengthen its deterrents and defenses, Stoltenberg said.\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nUkrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskyy has said Russia is responsible for \"state terrorism\" in Ukraine, with over 2,800 Russian missiles having hit its cities so far during the war.\n\nIn his latest address overnight, Zelenskyy said he had taken part in a special meeting of the U.N. Security Council, convened at the request of Ukraine on Tuesday, in order to \"take advantage of all international levers to bring Russia to justice for state terrorism.\"\n\n\"For everything done by the Russian army against Ukrainians in Kremenchuk, in Ochakiv, in Lysychansk, in Kharkiv, in Dnipro, in many, many other cities of Ukraine. As of this evening, the total number of Russian missiles that have hit our cities is already 2,811. And there are many more air bombs, many artillery shells,\" he said.\n\nThe president noted that the U.N. Security Council today stood in silence to commemorate all Ukrainians killed by the Russian army so far during the conflict, noting that \"the members of the Russian delegation looked at everyone present in the Security Council and also decided to stand up ... but everyone knows that it is Russian terror, it is the Russian state that is killing innocent people in this war waged against the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nRussia has again been accused of war crimes after a Russian missile hit a shopping mall in Kremenchuk in central Ukraine. The strike killed at least 20 civilians shopping in the building and injured at least 59 people, with others still missing. Ukraine's interior minister said yesterday that there were no survivors under the rubble because of the fire that spread through the building after the missile strike.\n\nRussia has repeatedly denied that it has targeted civilians or civilian infrastructure despite multiple instances refuting those claims. It has also spread falsehoods and disinformation about such attacks; on Tuesday, Russia said it was targeting a depot of weapons donated by the U.S. and Europe near the mall, a claim dismissed by Ukraine.\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nGermany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has described the situation the country faces as a \"hybrid war,\" with the conflict in Ukraine having deep implications for the energy landscape in Europe, and Germany having to put plans in place in case its gas supplies -- which are supplied via Nord Stream 1 from Russia to Germany -- are cut by Moscow.\n\n\"We are faced now in Germany with the question now that if there's no gas coming through Nord Stream 1 ... we have to decide which institution may be cut off the grid,\" Baerbock told CNBC's Hadley Gamble on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are in a time of war, in Ukraine people are dying, but we are in a hybrid war where the war is also being done [fought] by energy,\" Baerbock said.\n\nGermany is particularly reliant on Russian gas supplies via its Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Before the war, there were plans for this supply to be doubled with a second pipeline, Nord Stream 2, despite misgivings about the pipeline from the United States, Ukraine and other countries in eastern Europe, particularly Poland.\n\nThe giant energy infrastructure project, while fully built and ready to function, has been put on ice -- perhaps permanently -- because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that the world's most powerful military alliance reached a deal to admit Sweden and Finland after resolving the concerns of holdout Turkey.\n\nThe push to add Sweden and Finland to the world's most powerful military alliance comes as Russia's assault on Ukraine amplifies fears of other countries in the region. Moscow, long wary of NATO expansion, has opposed the two nations' plans to join the alliance.\n\nBoth Finland and Sweden already meet many of the requirements to be NATO members. Some of the requirements include having a functioning democratic political system, a willingness to provide economic transparency and the ability to make military contributions to NATO missions.\n\nHowever, all 30 NATO members must approve a country's bid for it to be accepted into the alliance.\n\n-- Amanda Macias\n\nA satellite image by Planet Labs shows the destruction of a shopping mall in Kremenchuk, Ukraine.\n\nOn Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on the Telegram messaging platform that more than 1,000 people were inside at the time of the Russian rocket attack, according to an NBC News report.\n\n\"This is not an off-target missile strike, this is a calculated Russian strike -- exactly at this shopping mall,\" Zelenskyy said in his evening address.\n\nG-7 leaders condemned the Russian missile strike and pledged to hold \"Russian President Putin and those responsible\" to account.\n\nThe Kremlin has previously denied that it targets civilians.\n\n-- Amanda Macias\n\nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said the EU's stocks of gas are increasing as the bloc looks to other suppliers aside from Russia, but added that the region must have contingency plans in case Russia cuts its supplies.\n\n\"There will have to be -- particularly if Russia decides to cut supply altogether -- contingency plans but [gas] stocks are increasing nicely. We've reached a good level of stocks ... and if we complete the stocks we are able to manage this transition to the time when we will be completely independent from Russian gas,\" he told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick at a press conference.\n\nDraghi said Europe had implemented measures to tackle the economic fallout of the conflict including diversifying its suppliers and investing in renewable forms of energy.\n\n\"We went all over [for other suppliers], and we've replaced a good deal of the Russia gas,\" he said, noting that 40% of the EU's gas supplies came from Russia last year, whereas now it was down to 25%.\n\nA recession in Europe on account of the war in Ukraine is not an immediate forecast, Draghi also noted, saying: \"For the time being, the economy of the euro area is slowing down but we don't foresee a recession now. The Italian economy is actually going better than we expected a couple of months ago.\"\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://media.nbcchicago.com/2022/06/107082329-1656482889349-gettyimages-1241590195-AFP_32DE4XV.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 31, "stanza_neu": 49, "stanza_pos": 4, "swn_neg": 84, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094185246", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "01:28:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T01:28:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T01:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.545098066329956, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/28/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-125-of-the-invasion", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 125 of the invasion", "body": "Russia's attack on a shopping centre in Kremenchuk met with global outrage as officials confirm at least 16 killed in the strike\n\nA Russian missile hit a crowded shopping centre in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk on Monday, killing and injuring scores of people, Ukrainian authorities said.

AP Photo/George Ivanchenko\n\nKREMENCHUK, Ukraine -- Russian forces battled Wednesday to surround the Ukrainian military's last stronghold in a long-contested eastern province, as shock reverberated from a Russian airstrike on a shopping mall that killed at least 18 in the center of the country two days earlier.\n\nMoscow's battle to wrest the entire Donbas region from Ukraine saw Russian forces pushing toward two villages south of Lysychansk while Ukrainian troops fought to prevent their encirclement.\n\nBritain's defense ministry said Russian forces were making \"incremental advances\" in their offensive to capture Lysychansk, the last city in the Luhansk province under Ukrainian control following the retreat of Ukraine's forces from the neighboring city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nRussian troops and their separatist allies control 95% of Luhansk and about half of Donetsk, the two provinces that make up the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas.\n\nThe latest assessment by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said the Ukrainians were likely in a fighting withdrawal to seek more defensible positions while draining the Russian forces of manpower and resources.\n\nAvril Haines, the U.S. director of national intelligence, said Russia \"may think time is on its side\" due to the escalating costs borne by the West and fatigue as the war grows longer. The most likely scenario predicted by American intelligence, Haines said, is a \"grinding struggle\" in which Russia consolidates its hold over southern Ukraine by the fall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. correctly predicted Russia would invade Ukraine in February, but was wrong in assessing that it would quickly seize Kyiv. Speaking at an event in Washington on Wednesday, Haines said Russian President Vladimir Putin \"has effectively the same political goals that he had previously, which is to say that he wants to take most of Ukraine\" and push it away from NATO.\n\n\"We perceive a disconnect between Putin's near-term military objectives in this area and his military's capacity, a kind of mismatch between his ambitions and what the military is able to accomplish,\" Haines said.\n\nAn elderly Ukrainian woman looks on after Russian shelling in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, Wednesday, June 29, 2022. AP Photo/George Ivanchenko\n\nMeanwhile, crews continued to search through the rubble of the shopping mall in Kremenchuk where Ukrainian authorities say 20 people remain missing.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Services press officer Svitlana Rybalko told The Associated Press that along with the 18 people killed, investigators found fragments of eight more bodies. It was not immediately clear whether that meant there were more victims. A number of survivors suffered severed limbs.\n\n\"The police cannot say for sure how many (victims) there are. So we are finding not the bodies but the fragments of bodies,\" Rybalko said. \"Now we are clearing at the very epicenter of the blast. Here, we practically cannot find bodies as such.\"\n\nSeveral families stood by what was left of the Amstor shopping center Wednesday morning in hope of finding missing loved ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This is pure genocide,\" local resident Tatiana Chernyshova said while going to lay flowers at the site. \"Such things cannot happen in the 21st century.\"\n\n\"We need to engage everyone to help stop the war, help us fight these scum -- these Russian aggressors,\" Chernyshova said.\n\nPsychologists working at the site with families said they were trying to help people come to terms with their loss.\n\n\"We are trying to help them release their emotions now, as later it becomes harder and much more painful,\" said one psychologist, who did not give his name as he was not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nAfter the attack on the mall, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of becoming a \"terrorist\" state. On Wednesday, he reproached NATO for not embracing or equipping his embattled country more fully.\n\n\"The open-door policy of NATO shouldn't resemble old turnstiles on Kyiv's subway, which stay open but close when you approach them until you pay,\" Zelensky told NATO leaders meeting in Madrid, speaking by video link. \"Hasn't Ukraine paid enough? Hasn't our contribution to defending Europe and the entire civilization been sufficient?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky addresses a round table meeting via video link during a NATO summit in Madrid, Spain on Wednesday, June 29, 2022. AP Photo/Manu Fernandez\n\nHe asked for more modern artillery systems and other weapons and warned the NATO leaders they either had to provide Ukraine with the help it needed to defeat Russia or \"face a delayed war between Russia and yourself.\"\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Wednesday dismissed what she claimed was the Ukrainian government's \"blatant provocation\" in trying to blame the mall missile strike on Russia's military.\n\nBritain's defense ministry said there was a \"realistic possibility\" that the mall strike \"was intended to hit a nearby infrastructure target.\"\n\n\"Russian planners highly likely remain willing to accept a high level of collateral damage when they perceive military necessity in striking a target,\" the ministry said. \"It is almost certain that Russia will continue to conduct strikes in an effort to interdict the resupplying of Ukrainian front-line forces.\"\n\nRussia's military also is experiencing a shortage of more modern precision strike weapons, which is compounding civilian casualties, the British ministry said.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, a Russian missile strike on a multi-story apartment building Wednesday in the city of Mykolaiv killed at least four people and injured five, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said. Mykolaiv is a major port and seizing it -- as well as Odesa farther west -- would be key to Russia's objective of cutting off Ukraine from its Black Sea coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia's defense ministry said in a statement that the missile strike on Mykolaiv targeted a base for training \"foreign mercenaries,\" as well as ammunition depots.\n\nIn other developments Wednesday:\n\n-- A senior Russian lawmaker warned that Lithuania's refusal to allow some goods targeted by European Union sanctions through to Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad could trigger a military confrontation.\n\nThe statement by Vladimir Dzhabarov, a deputy head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of Russia's parliament, followed the Kremlin's warning that it will retaliate against restrictions of transit to Kaliningrad. The region borders EU and NATO members Poland and Lithuania.\n\n-- Russia's foreign ministry summoned Norway's charge d'affaires to protest Oslo's blocking of a shipment of supplies to a Russian coal-mining town in the Svalbard islands.\n\nAlthough the Svalbards are Norwegian territory, a 1920 treaty allows all signatory countries the right to exploit its natural resources. Russia operates a coal mine in Barentsburg, a settlement of about 450 people, which relies on shipments from the mainland of food, machinery and other supplies. Norway imposed sanctions on shipments from Russia in April.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n-- Ukrainian military intelligence says that in the largest prisoner swap since the start of the war 144 Ukrainian troops were released from Russian captivity. Of those released, 95 were involved in defending the Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's devastated southern city of Mariupol before Russian forces captured it weeks ago. Denis Pushilin, the separatist leader in Donetsk, said an equal number of soldiers was released by both sides.\n\n-- European Union leaders approved a 600-million euro ($631 million) package to address food security issues brought on by the Ukrainian war in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.\n\n-- Britain is imposing sanctions on Russia's second-richest man and on a cousin of Putin's. Vladimir Potanin, owner of the Interross conglomerate, has continued to amass wealth while backing Putin, acquiring Rosbank and shares in Tinkoff Bankonith in the period following the invasion of Ukraine, a U.K. government statement said Wednesday.\n\nThe statement said Putin's cousin, Anna Tsivileva, and her husband, Sergey Tsivilev, have \"significantly benefited\" from their relationship with Putin. Tsivileva is president of the JSC Kolmar Group coal mining company, and Tsivilev is governor of the coal-rich Kemerovo region.\n\n___\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

They help an old guy like me with the techy stuff,\" said Mr Freedman, who moved to Kremenchuk to be with his Ukrainian wife.\n\n\"But I know that at least two of them are missing. It's terrible. Most of the people who worked in that place were young folk in their 20s or 30s.\"\n\nAt least 18 people died and 50 more were injured in Monday's missile attack on the Amstor mall, which happened while it was packed with shoppers. Ukrainian officials said that up to 36 more people were still feared missing in the wreckage, their bodies incinerated beyond recognition.\n\nWhatever the final death count, it is already one of the deadliest Russian missile attacks on civilian buildings since the war began four months ago. Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has branded it \"one of the most defiant terrorist attacks in European history\".\n\nAt the scene on Tuesday, teams of firefighters sat exhausted after working all night to pull bodies from the rubble.\n\nMeanwhile, from his bed in a nearby hospital, one survivor peppered with shrapnel described how two massive explosions engulfed the building the previous afternoon, creating a smoking inferno that briefly turned day into night.\n\n\"There was an air raid warning a few minutes beforehand, and I stepped outside the building to have a smoke,\" said Alexander, 33, who declined to give his surname.\n\n\"The blast threw me under a truck, and there was a huge amount of dust and smoke. It was only after a while that I could see light. I am very lucky to be alive.\"\n\nIt was not the first time that Moscow has bombed Ukrainian shopping malls, which it claims are used as storage depots for weapons. One mall was completely destroyed in Odesa in early May, killing one person and injuring six, while another was hit in Kyiv in March, killing eight.\n\nHowever, in both previous shopping mall strikes, the missiles hit late in the evening, when the premises were occupied only by night staff, keeping casualties to a relative minimum.\n\nThere was no such caution with Monday's strike in Kremenchuk, a gritty industrial city where the centre is one of the few attractions. Among locals, it is popular for its coffee shops, well-stocked deli and having the best toy shop in town.\n\nCCTV footage from a nearby water park captured how the missile shook the entire neighbourhood, with chunks of shrapnel and debris splashing like giant raindrops into the park's artificial lake. Passers-by could be seen running for cover.\n\nMr Freedman, who is originally from Margate, said that after the explosions, the heat and smoke from the blaze made it perilous for rescue workers to get close.\n\n\"A lot of cars in the car park started to explode, which made it even more difficult for the emergency services to do anything,\" he added.\n\nLocated on the River Dnipro in central Ukraine, Kremenchuk has until now been largely unscathed by the war, hence Mr Freedman's decision to stay put when the Foreign Office advised all Britons to leave. Yet like many Ukrainian cities, air raid sirens still ring out several times every day - so much so, that they are often simply ignored.\n\nThat, though, may have made the difference between life and death for those in the Amstor mall on Monday.\n\n\"I left the mall after I heard the air raid alarm, and a few minutes later the explosions happened. If I hadn't left, I would have died,\" said Daria Yukhno, 25, a mall worker whose jewellery store stock was melted by the heat of the blaze.\n\n\"I think some people just figured it was a false alarm as usual and stayed where they were. A friend of mine who worked in a coffee shop has died, and lots of other people I know have just disappeared.\"\n\nSvetlana Rybalko, a spokesman for Ukraine's Fire and Rescue Service, said the missile strike was the worst carnage she had encountered in 21 years in the emergency services.\n\n\"I have seen a lot of bad stuff, but this was something unreal - and this was done deliberately,\" she said.\n\n\"The firefighters themselves are shocked. They hoped to rescue some people, but the fire engulfed the building in just a few minutes and they found hardly anybody left alive.\n\n\"They are finding body parts that are unrecognisable. We are hoping that it's not children.\"\n\nUkrainian prosecutors have described the attack as a \"crime against humanity\" and international war crimes investigators have already visited the scene.\n\nWithin hours of its previous missile attack on a shopping mall in Kyiv in March, the Kremlin promptly produced detailed video footage that appeared to support its claim that the premises had been used to hide mobile weapons systems. As of Tuesday night, there had been no such footage produced for the Kremenchuk attack.\n\nMoscow claimed that the blaze at the shopping mall was caused by fire spreading from its strike on a nearby Western arms depot. It also falsely said that the mall was empty.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Freedman was still waiting anxiously to hear news of his friends from the electronics shop. When it finally come through, it was even worse than he had feared.\n\n\"One is dead, five are in hospital and nine are missing,\" he revealed.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_freeman@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Colin Freeman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/EU9WBAuLPX0/maxresdefault.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 25, "stanza_neu": 20, "stanza_pos": 4, "swn_neg": 49, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094274851", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "03:58:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T03:58:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T03:57:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.545098066329956, "url": "https://foreignaffairs.co.nz/2022/06/28/mil-osi-china-16-killed-in-missile-strike-on-ukrainian-mall-2/", "title": "MIL-OSI China: 16 killed in missile strike on Ukrainian mall", "body": "At least 16 people were killed and 59 others wounded in a missile strike on a mall in Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, the head of Ukraine's emergency services said early Tuesday.\n\n\"As of now, we know of 16 dead and 59 wounded, 25 of them hospitalized.

Hasn't our contribution to defending Europe and the entire civilization been sufficient?\"\n\nHe asked for more modern artillery systems and other weapons and warned the NATO leaders they either had to provide Ukraine with the help it needed to defeat Russia or \"face a delayed war between Russia and yourself.\"\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Wednesday dismissed what she claimed was the Ukrainian government's \"blatant provocation\" in trying to blame the mall missile strike on Russia's military.\n\nBritain's defense ministry said there was a \"realistic possibility\" that the mall strike \"was intended to hit a nearby infrastructure target.\"\n\n\"Russian planners highly likely remain willing to accept a high level of collateral damage when they perceive military necessity in striking a target,\" the ministry said. \"It is almost certain that Russia will continue to conduct strikes in an effort to interdict the resupplying of Ukrainian front-line forces.\"\n\nRussia's military also is experiencing a shortage of more modern precision strike weapons that is compounding civilian casualties, the British ministry said.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, a Russian missile strike on a multi-story apartment building Wednesday in the city of Mykolaiv killed at least four people and injured five, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said. Mykolaiv is a major port and seizing it - as well as Odesa further west - would be key to Russia's objective of cutting off Ukraine from its Black Sea coast.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said in a statement that the missile strike on Mykolaiv targeted a base for training \"foreign mercenaries,\" as well as ammunition depots.\n\nKyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko on Tuesday urged NATO leaders in Madrid to do whatever it took to stop the war, saying that if Ukraine is defeated, \"you're going to be next.\"\n\nIn other developments:\n\n- A senior Russian lawmaker has warned that Lithuania's refusal to allow some goods targeted by European Union sanctions through to Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad could trigger a military confrontation.\n\nWednesday's statement by Vladimir Dzhabarov, a deputy head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of Russia's parliament, followed the Kremlin's warning that it will retaliate against restrictions of transit to Kaliningrad. The region borders EU and NATO members Poland and Lithuania.\n\n- Russia's foreign ministry summoned Norway's charge d'affaires to protest Oslo's blocking of a shipment of supplies to a Russian coal-mining town in the Svalbard islands.\n\nAlthough the Svalbards are Norwegian territory, a 1920 treaty allows all signatory countries the right to exploit its natural resources. Russia operates a coal mine in Barentsburg, a settlement of about 450 people, which relies on shipments from the mainland of food, machinery and other supplies. Norway imposed sanctions on shipments from Russia in April.\n\n- European Union leaders approved Wednesday a 600-million euro ($631 million) package to address food security issues brought on by the Ukraine war in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.\n\n- Britain is imposing sanctions on Russia's second-richest man and on a cousin of President Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Potanin, owner of the Interross conglomerate, has continued to amass wealth while backing Putin, acquiring Rosbank and shares in Tinkoff Bankonith in the period following the invasion of Ukraine, a U.K. government statement said Wednesday.\n\nThe statement said Putin's cousin, Anna Tsivileva, and her husband, Sergey Tsivilev, have \"significantly benefited\" from their relationship with Putin. Tsivileva is president of the JSC Kolmar Group coal mining company, and Tsivilev is governor of the coal-rich Kemerovo region.\n\n---", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/06/29/PDTN/e81aa643-04fd-4bf2-9daf-bed69cfeb09c-GettyImages-1241584161.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1023,575,x0,y52&format=pjpg&width=1200", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 15, "stanza_neu": 35, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 50, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093886363", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "18:20:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T18:20:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T18:10:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5372549295425415, "url": "https://www.tmz.com/2022/06/27/ukraine-shopping-center-mall-russian-missile-strike-3-dead-wounded-war/", "title": "Ukraine Shopping Mall in Flames After Russian Missile Strike, At Least 3 Dead", "body": "Vladimir Putin is showing no mercy ... disgustingly firing missiles into a Ukraine shopping mall, and video following the attack shows the building -- with nearly 1,000 civilians inside -- up in flames.\n\nTwo Russian missiles were reportedly fired Monday into the shopping center, on Monday, in the central city of Kremenchuk.

Lysychansk is the last major area of the province under Ukrainian control following the retreat of Ukraine's fighters from the neighboring city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nRussian troops and their separatist allies control 95% of Luhansk and hold about half of Donetsk region, the other province that makes up the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas.\n\nThe latest assessment by the Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said the Ukrainians were likely in a fighting withdrawal to seek more defensible positions while draining the Russian military forces of manpower and resources.\n\nMeanwhile, crews continued to search through the rubble of the shopping mall in Kremenchuk where Ukrainian authorities say 20 people remained missing. Authorities in the city declared three days of mourning.\n\nThe blast from Tuesday's airstrike was so powerful, relatives may not be able to recover any trace of their loved ones' remains.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Services press officer Svitlana Rybalko told The Associated Press that along with the 18 people killed, investigators found fragments of eight more bodies. A number of survivors were being treated for injuries such as skull fractures and severed limbs.\n\n\"The police cannot say for sure how many (victims) there are. So we are finding not the bodies but the fragments of bodies,\" Rybalko said. \"Now we are clearing at the very epicenter of the blast.

The first hit the shopping mall, while the second struck a nearby factory, the one Russia claims was used to store weapons.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said it conducted two in-site investigations at the factory in question and did not uncover any evidence to support Russia's claims that the facility was used to store military equipment provided by the West.\n\n\"It's a place for making road equipment, machines for road construction,\" Svitlana Rybalko, from the regional State Emergency Service, told the BBC. \"There's also a greenhouse nearby where workers grow cucumbers.\"\n\nThe BBC reported that the factory is about 300 meters away from the shopping center, separated by a wall and rail tracks.

More than a dozen of people were killed.\n\nBy FRANCESCA EBEL and YURAS KARMANAU - Associated Press\n\nKREMENCHUK, Ukraine (AP) -- France's president said Tuesday that Russia \"cannot and should not win\" in Ukraine, voicing the West's continued support for Kyiv following Moscow's horrific missile attack on a shopping mall that underscored the war's terrible toll on civilians.\n\nUkrainian leaders denounced the strike, which killed 18 in the central city of Kremenchuk, as a war crime and a terrorist attack, and it drew swift condemnation from the Group of Seven leaders meeting in Europe at the time. It came as an unusually intense barrage of Russian fire all across Ukraine, including in the capital of Kyiv, drew new attention to a war that some fear could fade from the headlines as it drags on.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G-7 summit in Germany, French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven leading industrialized democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

He added that Monday's attack on the mall was \"a new war crime.\"\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian authorities claimed that the mall was not the target.\n\nHow to counter Russia and back Ukraine will be the focus of a summit this week of the western NATO alliance, whose support has been critical to Kyiv's ability to fend off Moscow's larger and better equipped forces. Ukrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to continue to hold off and even drive back Russia, which is pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern region of the Donbas.\n\nAs Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping mall that authorities said was struck when more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when there was an explosion. The blast knocked her down. When another came about 10 minutes later, she realized she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicenter with all of my strength,\" she said. Fighting back tears, she added: \"You have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nMany of those inside quickly fled the building when an air raid siren sounded and took shelter across the street, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said. Several of the bodies of those who didn't make it out in time are burned beyond recognition and their identification could take days, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded. Another 21 people are still missing, Monastyrsky said.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theater, a train station, and a hospital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history,\" while the G-7 leaders said \"indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.\"\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the attack.\n\nAs condemnation of the strike came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals. He said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognizing its control over territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire. Ukrainian officials have contradicted that, saying the mall was hit directly.\n\nKonashenkov said the depot was near a factory for road construction equipment. Mykola Danileiko, a spokesman for that factory, confirmed that it was hit along with the mall, but insisted that there were no weapons there. Wayne Jordash, a British lawyer who is working with Ukrainian officials to investigate possible war crimes, meanwhile, said that initial indications were that there were no military targets nearby, but the investigation is ongoing.\n\nKonashenkov also alleged that the mall was not in use, a false claim contradicted by witnesses.\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity,\" noting that Moscow's military has been \"systematically shelling civilian infrastructure with the aim to scare people, to kill people, to bring terror to our cities and villages.\"\n\nVenediktova emphasized the need for Ukrainians across the entire country to remain alert, adding that they should expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. A further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to local officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire in recent days came as the G-7 leaders gathered in Europe. They pledged continued support for Ukraine and the world's major economies prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. The U.S. appeared ready to respond to that call, and NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of its summit as the alliance turns its attention once again to confronting an adversarial Russia.\n\nIn a sinister warning as NATO leaders gathered in Madrid ahead of that summit, Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos published satellite images and the precise coordinates of the conference hall where the meeting will be held.\n\nIt also posted the images and coordinates of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin -- referring to them as \"decision-making centers supporting the Ukrainian nationalists\" in a message on the Telegram app. That wording echoes Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier warnings that he could target such centers in response to what he has called aggressive Western actions.\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

Lysychansk is the last major area of the province under Ukrainian control following the retreat of Ukraine's forces from the neighbouring city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nRussian troops and their separatist allies control 95% of Luhansk and about half of the Donetsk region, the other province that makes up the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas.\n\nThe latest assessment by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said the Ukrainians were likely in a fighting withdrawal to seek more defensible positions while draining the Russian military forces of manpower and resources.\n\nMeanwhile, crews continued to search through the rubble of the shopping mall in Kremenchuk where Ukrainian authorities say 20 people remain missing. Authorities in the city declared three days of mourning.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Services press officer Svitlana Rybalko told The Associated Press that along with the 18 people killed, investigators found fragments of eight more bodies. It was not immediately clear whether that meant there were more victims. A number of survivors suffered severed limbs.\n\n\"The police cannot say for sure how many (victims) there are. So we are finding not the bodies but the fragments of bodies,\" Rybalko said. \"Now we are clearing at the very epicenter of the blast. Here, we practically cannot find bodies as such.\"\n\nSeveral families stood by what was left of the Amstor shopping center Wednesday morning in hope of finding missing loved ones.\n\n\"This is pure genocide,\" local resident Tatiana Chernyshova said while going to lay flowers at the site. \"Such things cannot happen in the 21st century.\"\n\n\"We need to engage everyone to help stop the war, help us fight these scum -- these Russian aggressors,\" Chernyshova said.\n\nPsychologists working at the site with families said they were trying to help people come to terms with their loss.\n\n\"We are trying to help them release their emotions now, as later it becomes harder and much more painful,\" said one psychologist, who did not give his name as he was not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nAfter the attack on the mall, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of becoming \"a terrorist\" state. On Wednesday, he reproached NATO for not embracing or equipping his embattled country more fully.\n\n\"The open-door policy of NATO shouldn't resemble old turnstiles on Kyiv's subway, which stay open but close when you approach them until you pay,\" Zelenskyy told NATO leaders meeting in Madrid, speaking by video link. \"Hasn't Ukraine paid enough? Hasn't our contribution to defending Europe and the entire civilization been sufficient?\"\n\nHe asked for more modern artillery systems and other weapons and warned the NATO leaders they either had to provide Ukraine with the help it needed to defeat Russia or \"face a delayed war between Russia and yourself.\"\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Wednesday dismissed what she claimed was the Ukrainian government's \"blatant provocation\" in trying to blame the mall missile strike on Russia's military.\n\nBritain's defence ministry said there was a \"realistic possibility\" that the mall strike \"was intended to hit a nearby infrastructure target.\"\n\n\"Russian planners highly likely remain willing to accept a high level of collateral damage when they perceive military necessity in striking a target,\" the ministry said. \"It is almost certain that Russia will continue to conduct strikes in an effort to interdict the resupplying of Ukrainian front-line forces.\"\n\nRussia's military also is experiencing a shortage of more modern precision strike weapons that is compounding civilian casualties, the British ministry said.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, a Russian missile strike on a multi-story apartment building Wednesday in the city of Mykolaiv killed at least four people and injured five, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said. Mykolaiv is a major port and seizing it -- as well as Odesa further west -- would be key to Russia's objective of cutting off Ukraine from its Black Sea coast.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said in a statement that the missile strike on Mykolaiv targeted a base for training \"foreign mercenaries,\" as well as ammunition depots.\n\nKyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko on Tuesday urged NATO leaders in Madrid to do whatever it took to stop the war, saying that if Ukraine is defeated, \"you're going to be next.\"\n\nIn other developments:\n\n-- A senior Russian lawmaker has warned that Lithuania's refusal to allow some goods targeted by European Union sanctions through to Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad could trigger a military confrontation.\n\nWednesday's statement by Vladimir Dzhabarov, a deputy head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of Russia's parliament, followed the Kremlin's warning that it will retaliate against restrictions of transit to Kaliningrad. The region borders EU and NATO members Poland and Lithuania.\n\n-- Russia's foreign ministry summoned Norway's charge d'affaires to protest Oslo's blocking of a shipment of supplies to a Russian coal-mining town in the Svalbard islands.\n\nAlthough the Svalbards are Norwegian territory, a 1920 treaty allows all signatory countries the right to exploit its natural resources. Russia operates a coal mine in Barentsburg, a settlement of about 450 people, which relies on shipments from the mainland of food, machinery and other supplies. Norway imposed sanctions on shipments from Russia in April.\n\n-- Ukrainian military intelligence says that in the largest prisoner swap since the start of the war 144 Ukrainian troops were released from Russian captivity. Of those released, 95 were involved in defending the Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's devastated southern city of Mariupol that Russian forces captured weeks ago. There was no word on how many Russian soldiers were freed in return.\n\n-- European Union leaders approved Wednesday a 600-million euro (US$631 million) package to address food security issues brought on by the Ukraine war in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.\n\n-- Britain is imposing sanctions on Russia's second-richest man and on a cousin of President Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Potanin, owner of the Interross conglomerate, has continued to amass wealth while backing Putin, acquiring Rosbank and shares in Tinkoff Bankonith in the period following the invasion of Ukraine, a U.K. government statement said Wednesday.\n\nThe statement said Putin's cousin, Anna Tsivileva, and her husband, Sergey Tsivilev, have \"significantly benefited\" from their relationship with Putin. Tsivileva is president of the JSC Kolmar Group coal mining company, and Tsivilev is governor of the coal-rich Kemerovo region.\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

It was only after a while that I could see light. I am very lucky to be alive.\"\n\nIt was not the first time that Russia has bombed Ukrainian shopping malls, which it claims are used as storage depots for weapons. One mall was completely destroyed in Odesa in early May, killing one person and injuring six, while another was hit in Kyiv in mid-March, killing eight.\n\nHowever, in both previous shopping mall strikes, the missiles hit late in the evening, when the premises were occupied only by night staff, keeping casualties to a relative minimum. There was no such caution with Monday's strike in Kremenchuk, a gritty industrial city where the mall is one of the few attractions.\n\nAmong locals it was popular for its coffee shops, well-stocked deli, and having the best toy shop in town.\n\nCCTV footage from a nearby water park captured how the missile shook the neighbourhood, with chunks of shrapnel and debris falling into the park's artificial lake. Passers-by could be seen running for cover.\n\nMr Freedman said that after the explosions, the heat and smoke from the blaze made it perilous for rescue workers to get close.\n\n\"A lot of cars in the car park started to explode, which made it even more difficult for the emergency services to do anything,\" he added.\n\nLocated on the River Dnipro in central Ukraine, Kremenchuk has until now been largely unscathed by the war - hence Mr Freedman's decision to stay put when the UK foreign office advised all Britons to leave. Yet like many Ukrainian cities, air raid sirens still ring out several times every day - so much so that they are often simply ignored.\n\nThat, though, may have made the difference between life and death for those in the Amstor mall on Monday.\n\n\"I left the mall after I heard the air raid alarm, and a few minutes later the explosions happened - if I hadn't left, I would have died,\" said mall worker Daria Yukhno (25) whose jewellery store stock had been melted by the heat of the blaze. \"I think some people just figured it was a false alarm as usual and stayed where they were. A friend of mine who worked in a coffee shop has died, and lots of other people I know have just disappeared.\"\n\nSvetlana Rybalko, a spokesman for Ukraine's Fire and Rescue Service, said the missile strike was the worst carnage she had encountered in 21 years in the emergency services.\n\n\"I have seen a lot of bad stuff, but this was something unreal - and this was done deliberately. The firefighters themselves are shocked - they hoped to rescue some people but the fire engulfed the building in just a few minutes and they found hardly anybody left alive,\" she said. \"They are finding body parts that are unrecognisable - we are hoping that it's not children.\"\n\nUkrainian prosecutors have described the attack as a \"crime against humanity\", and international war crimes investigators have already visited the scene.\n\nWithin hours of its previous missile attack on a shopping mall in Kyiv in March, the Kremlin promptly produced detailed video footage that appeared to support its claim that the premises had been used to hide mobile weapons systems.\n\nAs of last night, there had been no such footage produced for the Kremenchuk attack.\n\nMoscow claimed the blaze at the shopping mall was caused by fire spreading from its strike on a nearby Western arms depot. It also falsely said the mall was empty.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Freedman was still waiting anxiously to hear of news of his friends from the electronics shop.\n\nWhen it finally come through, it was even worse than he had feared: \"One is dead, five are in hospital and nine are missing,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/469eb/41800394.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/-RESIDENTS%202-a", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 23, "stanza_neu": 16, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 41, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7096656053", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-29", "time": "18:40:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-29T18:40:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-29T18:40:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5254902243614197, "url": "http://hosted.ap.org/article/82812f3897b0aeb0f196dbc837f35d2e/russians-fight-encircle-ukraines-last-eastern-stronghold", "title": "Russians fight to encircle Ukraine's last eastern stronghold", "body": "KREMENCHUK, Ukraine (AP) -- Russian forces battled Wednesday to surround the Ukrainian military's last stronghold in a long-contested eastern province, as shock reverberated from a Russian airstrike on a shopping mall that killed at least 18 in the center of the country two days earlier.\n\nMoscow's battle to wrest the entire Donbas region from Ukraine saw Russian forces pushing toward two villages south of Lysychansk while Ukrainian troops fought to prevent their encirclement.\n\nBritain's defense ministry said Russian forces were making \"incremental advances\" in their offensive to capture Lysychansk, the last city in the Luhansk province under Ukrainian control following the retreat of Ukraine's forces from the neighboring city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nRussian troops and their separatist allies control 95% of Luhansk and about half of Donetsk, the two provinces that make up the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas.\n\nThe latest assessment by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said the Ukrainians were likely in a fighting withdrawal to seek more defensible positions while draining the Russian forces of manpower and resources.\n\nAvril Haines, the U.S. director of national intelligence, said Russia \"may think time is on its side\" due to the escalating costs borne by the West and fatigue as the war grows longer. The most likely scenario predicted by American intelligence, Haines said, is a \"grinding struggle\" in which Russia consolidates its hold over southern Ukraine by the fall.\n\nThe U.S. correctly predicted Russia would invade Ukraine in February, but was wrong in assessing that it would quickly seize Kyiv. Speaking at an event in Washington on Wednesday, Haines said Russian President Vladimir Putin \"has effectively the same political goals that he had previously, which is to say that he wants to take most of Ukraine\" and push it away from NATO.\n\n\"We perceive a disconnect between Putin's near-term military objectives in this area and his military's capacity, a kind of mismatch between his ambitions and what the military is able to accomplish,\" Haines said.\n\nMeanwhile, crews continued to search through the rubble of the shopping mall in Kremenchuk where Ukrainian authorities say 20 people remain missing.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Services press officer Svitlana Rybalko told The Associated Press that along with the 18 people killed, investigators found fragments of eight more bodies.

Mykolaiv is a major port and seizing it -- as well as Odesa farther west -- would be key to Russia's objective of cutting off Ukraine from its Black Sea coast.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said in a statement that the missile strike on Mykolaiv targeted a base for training \"foreign mercenaries,\" as well as ammunition depots.\n\nIn other developments Wednesday:\n\n-- A senior Russian lawmaker warned that Lithuania's refusal to allow some goods targeted by European Union sanctions through to Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad could trigger a military confrontation.\n\nThe statement by Vladimir Dzhabarov, a deputy head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of Russia's parliament, followed the Kremlin's warning that it will retaliate against restrictions of transit to Kaliningrad. The region borders EU and NATO members Poland and Lithuania.\n\n-- Russia's foreign ministry summoned Norway's charge d'affaires to protest Oslo's blocking of a shipment of supplies to a Russian coal-mining town in the Svalbard islands.\n\nAlthough the Svalbards are Norwegian territory, a 1920 treaty allows all signatory countries the right to exploit its natural resources. Russia operates a coal mine in Barentsburg, a settlement of about 450 people, which relies on shipments from the mainland of food, machinery and other supplies. Norway imposed sanctions on shipments from Russia in April.\n\n-- Ukrainian military intelligence says that in the largest prisoner swap since the start of the war 144 Ukrainian troops were released from Russian captivity. Of those released, 95 were involved in defending the Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's devastated southern city of Mariupol before Russian forces captured it weeks ago. Denis Pushilin, the separatist leader in Donetsk, said an equal number of soldiers was released by both sides.\n\n-- European Union leaders approved a 600-million euro ($631 million) package to address food security issues brought on by the Ukrainian war in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.\n\n-- Britain is imposing sanctions on Russia's second-richest man and on a cousin of Putin's. Vladimir Potanin, owner of the Interross conglomerate, has continued to amass wealth while backing Putin, acquiring Rosbank and shares in Tinkoff Bankonith in the period following the invasion of Ukraine, a U.K. government statement said Wednesday.\n\nThe statement said Putin's cousin, Anna Tsivileva, and her husband, Sergey Tsivilev, have \"significantly benefited\" from their relationship with Putin.

It was where teenagers went to hang out on weekends.\n\nBy Monday evening, Amstor was a smouldering mess after it was struck by a pair of Russian missiles. At least 13 people were killed, a number that was expected to continue to rise as an unknown number of shoppers were believed to be buried beneath the wreckage of the shopping centre's roof, which collapsed on top of them as they tried to escape the blazing mall.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that as many as 1,000 people were in the mall at the time of the attack, and that it was \"impossible to even imagine the number of victims.\" In his evening video message, Mr. Zelensky said, \"This is not an accidental hit, this is a calculated Russian strike exactly onto this shopping centre.\"\n\nZelensky tells G-7 summit Ukraine forces face urgent moment\n\nWalking through the wreckage of the mall, Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the country's Interior Minister, said, \"A large number of people have died. Almost everyone who was inside. How can we know how many?\"\n\nMany interpreted the attack as the latest in a series of messages aimed at scaring both Ukrainians and their allies in the West. The strike on Kremenchuk was one of several Russian barrages on Sunday and Monday, with missiles hitting civilian targets in cities including Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa as G7 leaders were gathering in Germany pledging to support Ukraine militarily and economically \"for as long as it takes.\"\n\nIn a joint statement, the G7 leaders said Monday that they condemned \"the abominable attack on a shopping mall in Kremenchuk,\" noting that the targeting of innocent civilians was a war crime. \"We will not rest until Russia ends its cruel and senseless war on Ukraine,\" the statement concludes.\n\nThe G7 meeting ended Monday, but there are worries that Russia will continue to bombard Ukrainian cities throughout the NATO summit, which runs Tuesday through Thursday in Madrid. On Monday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the 30-member alliance would name Russia as \"the most significant and direct threat to our security\" and increase the number of troops on high readiness for combat to \"well over 300,000.\"\n\nHours after the attack on Kremenchuk, smoke was still rising from the twisted metal and broken cement that once was a collection of dozens of smaller shops under the Amstor roof: among them a popular grocer, a trendy jeans store, a pet shop and a jeweller. On one clothing rack that somehow remained upright after the blast, an \"Air Jordan\" Nike sweatshirt still hung, blackened by soot.\n\nThe Prosecutor General's Office reported on Monday that more than 40 people were missing after the attack.\n\nSmall fires continued to burn as evening fell, and the painstaking hunt for survivors was interrupted by an air-raid siren that sent firefighters, police and local residents scrambling into shelters, fearing a follow-up attack.\n\nBut four months into Russia's invasion of Ukraine - and after hearing air-raid sirens several times a day for most of that time - not everyone goes into the shelters any more, a reality that likely cost lives in Kremenchuk. Anna Vasenko, a local spokeswoman for the National Police of Ukraine, said that a siren had sounded \"five to seven minutes\" before the rockets slammed into the mall around 4 p.m. local time.\n\nSome shoppers, she said, had likely decided to ignore the sirens that had long since become routine everywhere in Ukraine. Others, she said, simply didn't have time to get out.\n\nRoman Shamray, a manager at one of the shops inside Amstor, likely survived for two reasons: He was on a smoke break when the sirens went, and he had promised his wife and young daughter - who have been living as refugees in Germany since the start of the war - that he would always go into a shelter when he heard a siren.\n\nHours after the attack, he stood outside Kremenchuk's Hospital No. 3, waiting for news about colleagues - some of whom were injured and inside the hospital, others from whom he had heard nothing since the explosions. Evidently still in shock from the day's events, Mr. Shamray said he couldn't even say how many of his friends were missing.\n\n\"This shopping centre had the biggest toy store in the city. How could this be a strategic object?\" the 28-year-old said. \"It was targeted because it was a large accumulation of people, and the Russians want to create panic. They can't win the war, so they want to sow panic.\"\n\nMr. Shamray said the management of the mall had decided three days ago to end its previous practice of shutting down during air-raid sirens and asking shoppers and staff to go into shelters, and to instead allow stores to operate as normal during the alarms.\n\nKremenchuk, which had a prewar population of 217,000, is home to the country's largest oil refinery, which was hit by Russian missiles in April. Like many Ukrainian cities, something like prewar life had only been starting to return in recent weeks as some of those who had fled Kremenchuk at the start of the war had started to trickle back.\n\nSome residents said they believed the Amstor mall was hit by accident, and that the real target might have been the city's railway station.\n\n\"A lot of armour and heavy weapons are transported through the railway, so maybe that was their target. Even their so-called precise missiles miss the target quite often,\" said Alyona Zakharova, a 41-year-old foreign languages teacher who was watching the rescue operation on Monday evening with her 15-year-old daughter, Irina, who had been at the mall on Saturday.\n\n\"But maybe their aim was to scare people. Who knows? Putin is a monster. He doesn't really give a damn about the lives of his own people, and especially not Ukrainians, whom he hates,\" she said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nFear has certainly arrived in Kremenchuk. Lyudmilla Yorzh was in her apartment across the street from Amstor when the missiles struck and blew her window in. The 67-year-old retiree said she grabbed some medicine and tried to go across to help survivors, but couldn't get closer than the parking lot because of the heat and the smoke.\n\nAs evening fell, she was sitting on a bench, steps from the local bomb shelter. \"I'm afraid even to go back into my home, in case there's another attack,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/eLVDR8zWk4h2TocJsweIfmm2P8k=/560x0/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tgam/J37RK34DV5FOXMU35B6PHNQ45Q.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 18, "stanza_neu": 29, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 48, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7095865847", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-29", "time": "07:48:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-29T07:48:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-29T07:09:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5215686559677124, "url": "https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/842392.html", "title": "Zelensky: All Russian servicemen responsible for terror against Ukrainian cities will be identified", "body": "President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian law enforces will identify all Russian servicemen responsible for terror against civilians in Ukraine.\n\n\"Ukraine's law enforcement and intelligence agencies are doing their best to identify all Russian servicemen responsible for the terror against our cities.

One of them, a three-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to local officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire in recent days came as the G7 leaders gathered in Europe.

Ukraine said three people died in the attack, including a six-year-old girl, while 17 others including hospital staff were wounded.\n\nMeanwhile, Solovyov led a media offensive against Boris Johnson, threatening again to use the Kremlin's Satan-2 hypersonic nuclear missile against the UK.\n\nIn his latest TV diatribe, Solovyov declared: 'So, Johnson says he'll deliver tanks [to Ukraine] in August.\n\n'I've got a question: Why are you so timid, Boris? Go on, declare war on Russia...\n\n'Go on, throw all your giant British army, your planes, your rusty submarines, all your nuclear ammunition - go on, throw them at Russia. The fact is that you are actually scared.'\n\n'You are sending your [mercenaries], then abandon them in the Donetsk People's Republic courts,' Solovyov added, referring to Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner who have been sentenced to death after being caught fighting along side Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol.\n\nSolovyov continued: 'What are you scared of Brits? Do you want to declare a war on us? Do! Go on, finally do it!\n\n'Do it! Pluck up your courage, don't you want to show how cool you are? Lead your troops, land somewhere...\n\n'This might give [space chief Dmitry] Rogozin a chance to test his Sarmat [hypersonic missile].\n\nMeanwhile, Solovyov led a media offensive against Boris Johnson, threatening again to use the Kremlin's Satan-2 hypersonic nuclear missile against the UK. Pictured: Boris Johnson with world leaders at the G7 Summit\n\nDelving back into history, he claimed the British royals had betrayed their Russian cousin Nicholas II in his hour of need after the Bolshevik revolution of 1917.\n\n'We remember you Brits, when you betrayed Nicholas II and his family,' he said. 'Remember that Boris? You seem to like history, don't you?\n\n'Ask Liz Truss what you did to the Tsar's family, how you promised to save them - and betrayed them! But this is your British tradition, to betray, and to be scared.'\n\nSolovyov also mocked Johnson for urging other G7 leaders to show Putin 'our chest muscles'.\n\n'Well, that is important for Johnson,' said the propagandist known as Putin's Voice. 'And it is important that when showing his chest muscles he doesn't step on them accidentally.\n\n'Because, well... this is what Boris Johnson looks like.'\n\nThe camera showed Johnson on a morning run, provoking hilarity among pro-Putin TV pundits.\n\nSolovyov said: 'This is how he was going for a walk. Well, to be blunt, there is no hint of macho here.'\n\nAnother pundit body shames Johnson: 'This is a special type of macho.'\n\nSolovyov goes on: 'A new type of macho, gender appropriate. At the same time, he doesn't change his underwear. These underwear-shorts, he always runs only in them.\n\n'Apparently, this is his lucky underwear . Today, he went for a run.\n\n'He was offloaded [from a car] and he immediately started running. As far as I understand, he ran straight into a hotel, so it's not too far [for him to run]. Perfect run.\n\n'If you run out of the car and run to the hotel, then it's perfect.

Lysychansk is the last major area of the province under Ukrainian control following the retreat of Ukraine's fighters from the neighboring city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nRussian troops and their separatist allies control 95% of Luhansk and hold about half of Donetsk region, the other province that makes up the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas.\n\nThe latest assessment by the Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said the Ukrainians were likely in a fighting withdrawal to seek more defensible positions while draining the Russian military forces of manpower and resources.\n\nMeanwhile, crews continued to search through the rubble of the shopping mall in Kremenchuk where Ukrainian authorities say 20 people remained missing. Authorities in the city declared three days of mourning.\n\nThe blast from Tuesday's airstrike was so powerful, relatives may not be able to recover any trace of their loved ones' remains.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Services press officer Svitlana Rybalko told The Associated Press that along with the 18 people killed, investigators found fragments of eight more bodies. A number of survivors were being treated for injuries such as skull fractures and severed limbs.\n\n\"The police cannot say for sure how many (victims) there are. So we are finding not the bodies but the fragments of bodies,\" Rybalko said. \"Now we are clearing at the very epicenter of the blast. Here, we practically cannot find bodies as such.\"\n\nSeveral families stood by what was left of the Amstor shopping center Wednesday morning in hopes of finding missing loved ones. One young woman sat cross-legged on the ground weeping behind dark sunglasses,.\n\n\"This is pure genocide,\" local resident Tatiana Chernyshova said while going to lay flowers at the site. \"Such things cannot happen in the 21st century. Peaceful people suffer.\"\n\n\"We need to engage everyone to help stop the war, help us fight these scum - these Russian aggressors,\" Chernyshova said. \"It needs to be stopped by any means possible.\"\n\nPsychologists working at the site with families told the AP they were trying to help people come to terms with their loss.\n\n\"We are trying to help them release their emotions now, as later it becomes harder and much more painful,\" said one psychologist, who did not give his name as he was not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nAfter the attack on the mall, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of becoming \"a terrorist\" state carrying out \"daily terrorist acts.\" On Wednesday, he reproached NATO for not embracing or equipping his embattled country more fully.\n\n\"The open-door policy of NATO shouldn't resemble old turnstiles on Kyiv's subway, which stay open but close when you approach them until you pay,\" Zelenskyy told NATO leaders meeting in Madrid, speaking by video link. \"Hasn't Ukraine paid enough? Hasn't our contribution to defending Europe and the entire civilization been sufficient?\"\n\nHe asked for more modern artillery systems and other weapons and warned the leaders they either had to provide Ukraine with the help it needed to defeat Russia or \"face a delayed war between Russia and yourself.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Wednesday dismissed what she claimed was the Ukrainian government's \"blatant provocation\" in trying to blame the mall missile strike on Russia's military.\n\n\"All these fakes, unfortunately, were replicated and distributed,\" Zakharova said.\n\nBritain's Defense Ministry said there was a \"realistic possibility\" the missile strike on the shopping center \"was intended to hit a nearby infrastructure target.\"\n\n\"Russian planners highly likely remain willing to accept a high level of collateral damage when they perceive military necessity in striking a target,\" the ministry said. \"It is almost certain that Russian will continue to conduct strikes in an effort to interdict the resupplying of Ukrainian front-line forces.\"\n\nRussia's military also is experiencing a shortage of \"more modern precision strike weapons\" that together with \"the professional shortcomings of their targeting planners\" is compounding civilian casualties, the British ministry said.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, a Russian missile strike in the city of Mykolaiv killed at least four people and injured five after a missile hit a multi-story apartment building Wednesday, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said.\n\nMykolaiv is a major port in Ukraine's south and seizing it - as well as Odesa further west - would be key to Russia's objection of cutting off Ukraine from its Black Sea coast.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said in a statement that the missile strike on Mykolaiv targeted a base for training \"foreign mercenaries,\" as well as ammunition depots.\n\nRussian forces have been regularly pummeling Ukrainian weapons and munitions depots, oil storages and other facilities across Ukraine.\n\nVitali Klitschko, the mayor of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, urged the NATO leaders in Madrid to do whatever it took to stop the war, saying that if Ukraine is defeated, \"you're going to be next.\"\n\n\"If it's not going to be stopped now, all of us are going to be affected. The free world, the so-called free world is going to be affected. And NATO and the world society needs to learn how to act fast,\" Klitschko said.\n\nSeparately, European Union leaders approved Wednesday a 600 million euro package to address food security issues brought on by the Ukraine war. The money, from European Development Fund reserves, will be earmarked for African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.\n\n___\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

It came during an unusually intense barrage of Russian strikes all across Ukraine, including in the capital of Kyiv, that drew new attention to a war that some fear could fade from the headlines as it drags on.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G-7 summit in Germany, Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven industrialized democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it \"one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\" The G-7 leaders said \"indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.\"\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the attack.\n\nStriking a defiant note, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia would press its offensive until it fulfills its goals, noting that the hostilities could end \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to meet the Russian demands and orders its troops to surrender.\n\nThe Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine recognize Russia's sovereignty over Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, acknowledge the independence of Moscow-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, and recognize the current situation, an apparent reference gains Russia has made since the start of the war.\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian authorities claimed that the mall was not the target. Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot containing Western weapons and ammunition, causing powerful blasts that set the mall on fire.\n\nUkrainian officials have directly contradicted that, saying the mall itself was hit in the strike. Wayne Jordash, a British lawyer who is working with Ukrainian officials to investigate possible war crimes, meanwhile. said that initial indications were that there were no military targets nearby, but the investigation is ongoing. He did say a factory nearby was also hit.\n\nKonashenkov also alleged that the mall was not in use, a false claim contradicted by witnesses.\n\nKateryna Romashyna, a local resident, told The Associated Press that she had just arrived at the mall when there was an explosion. The blast knocked her down. When another came about 10 minutes later, she realized she needed to get away.\n\n\"I ran away from the epicenter with all of my strength,\" she said. \"It was terrifying.\"\n\nFighting back tears, she said that \"you have to be a real monster\" to strike a shopping mall.\n\nThe regional governor, Dmytro Lunin, said at least 18 people were killed in the attack and 59 others sought medical assistance, of whom 25 were hospitalized. The region declared a day of mourning Tuesday for the victims of the attack.\n\nUkrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said after visiting the scene that many bodies were burned beyond recognition and their identification could take days, adding that 21 people were considered missing.\n\nMonastyrsky noted that most of up to 1,000 people who were in the mall when an air raid siren sounded quickly moved to a shelter across the road.\n\n\"Unfortunately, those people who stayed during the air alarm died only because they remained there,\" he added, urging both businesses and customers to adhere to safety protocols and quickly get to safety after an attack warning.\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the missile attack was one of Russia's \"crimes against humanity,\" noting that Moscow's military has been \"systematically shelling civilian infrastructure with the aim to scare people, to kill people, to bring terror to our cities and villages.\"\n\nVenediktova emphasized the need for Ukrainians across the entire country to remain alert, adding that they should expect a similar strike \"every minute.\"\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire in recent days came as the G-7 leaders gathered in Europe. They pledged continued support for Ukraine and the world's major economies prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nThe Russian strike echoed earlier attacks that caused large numbers of civilian casualties -- such as one in March on a Mariupol theater where many civilians had holed up, killing an estimated 600, and another in April on a train station in eastern Kramatorsk that killed at least 59 people.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv in the Mykolaiv region, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. A further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to local officials.\n\nRussia has increasingly used long-range bombers in the war. Ukrainian officials said Russian Tu-22M3 long-range bombers flying over Russia's western Kursk region fired the missiles, one of which hit the shopping center and another that struck a sports arena in Kremenchuk.\n\nZelenskyy has called for more air defense systems from his Western allies to help his forces fight back. The U.S. appeared ready to respond to that call, and NATO's support for Ukraine will be a major focus of its summit this week.\n\nThe attack on Kremenchuk came as Russia was pressing an all-out assault on the last Ukrainian stronghold in eastern Luhansk province -- part of its campaign to wrest the eastern Donbas region from Ukraine.\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

He noted that firefighters were able to locate the fire that broke out in the building after the impact.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky described the missile strike as one of the most heinous acts of terrorism in Europe. According to him, the attack was completely deliberate and was carried out by \"immoral terrorists who should not have a place on Earth\":\n\n\"The Russian state has become the largest terrorist organization in the world. This is a fact and must become a legal one. Everyone in the world must know that by buying or transporting Russian oil, it maintains ties with Russian banks, pays taxes and duties to the Russian state, that means giving money to terrorists.\"\n\nAbout 1,000 civilians were in the busy shopping center during the attack yesterday afternoon, Volodymyr Zelensky said. He said the mall had no strategic value for Russia and did not pose a threat to its forces\n\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia is a disgrace to humanity and must bear the consequences.

And they will respond to us. The war has started on the path of escalation. We will strike at military targets, this is an issue that cannot be discussed.\"\n\nA call for UN Security Council\n\nUkraine also called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on the latest Russian strikes. The main issue for it will be exactly what happened in Kremenchuk.\n\nA spokesman for the UN, Stephane Dujarric, called the attack \"pathetic\", and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it was the next in a series of atrocities.\n\nFor their part, the leaders of the G7 countries described it as \"disgusting\". According to them, what happened in Kremenchuk is a war crime and those involved must be held accountable.\n\nRussia is also reacting. Russia's deputy UN envoy, Dmitry Polyansky, described the incident as a new Ukrainian provocation in the style of Bucha and stressed that there were many inconsistencies \"that stand out\".\n\nKilled and wounded after shelling in Kharkiv\n\nRussian shelling on Monday in the central areas of the city of Kharkiv damaged residential buildings and a primary school, killing five people and injuring dozens, the regional governor of the Kharkiv region said.", "source": {"uri": "novinite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Novinite.com"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.novinite.com/media/images/2022-06/photo_verybig_215673.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 18, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 29, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093912048", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "18:50:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T18:50:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T18:34:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5176470875740051, "url": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/law-order/2089015-at-least-11-killed-in-russian-missile-strike-on-shopping-mall-ukraine-says", "title": "At least 11 killed in Russian missile strike on shopping mall, Ukraine says | Law-Order", "body": "It's useless to hope for decency and humanity from Russia,\" Zelenskiy wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Dmytro Lunin, governor of the central Poltava region, wrote on Telegram that 11 people had now been confirmed killed by the strike, adding that rescue workers would keep searching through the smouldering rubble, with more bodies likely to be found.\n\nTwo Russian missiles slammed into a crowded shopping centre in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk on Monday, killing at least 11 people and wounding 50, the regional governor said.

Rescue workers are still searching the site and authorities expect the death toll to rise.\n\nThe attack, which is likely to lead to one of the worst civilian death tolls in a single strike since Russia's invasion of its neighbour in February, was the latest in a series of missile strikes in a conflict that shows no sign of abating.\n\nDmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian president Vladimir Putin, said the war was going \"according to plan\" and that it would only end once Ukraine capitulated to Moscow's demands.\n\n\"The Ukrainian side can end everything by the end of today. They just need to order Ukrainian troops to lay down their weapons and fulfil Russia's conditions. And it'll all be over,\" Peskov told reporters.\n\nPutin's conditions for ending the war have been vague throughout the conflict.

A UK intelligence briefing on Tuesday described the wave of attacks as \"unusually intense\".\n\nThe latest assaults coincided with the G7 summit being held in Germany and a plea by Zelenskyy for G7 leaders to step up weapons supplies and sanctions against Russia.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Monday that the strike in Kremenchuk was \"the latest in a string of atrocities\".\n\nThe White House's ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, described it as \"absolutely sickening\" and said the organisation's security council -- of which Russia is a member -- would meet on Tuesday to \"discuss Russia's atrocities against civilians\".\n\nMoscow has repeatedly denied targeting populated areas and said it was only firing on military facilities.\n\nAt least 4,700 civilians have died since the invasion, according to the UN, although Ukrainian officials say the toll is likely to be many times higher.", "source": {"uri": "techbizweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechBizWeb"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://techbizweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/3debe5ab-b4ee-43ca-a0f0-66201dd8dc50.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 10, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 23, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7095064292", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "15:36:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T15:36:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T15:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5137255191802979, "url": "https://jerseyeveningpost.com/uncategorised/2022/06/28/macron-says-russia-cannot-win-in-ukraine-after-strike-on-shopping-centre/", "title": "Macron says Russia cannot win in Ukraine after strike on shopping centre", "body": "France's president has said Russia \"cannot and should not win\" in Ukraine, voicing the West's continued support for Kyiv following Moscow's horrific missile attack on a shopping centre.\n\nUkrainian leaders denounced the strike, which killed 18 people in the central city of Kremenchuk, as a war crime and a terrorist attack.\n\nThe attack drew swift condemnation from the Group of Seven (G7) leaders meeting in Germany at the time.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G7 summit in Germany, French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven leading industrialised democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity\".\n\n\"Russia cannot and should not win,\" he said. He added that Monday's attack on the shopping centre was \"a new war crime\".\n\nAs they have in other attacks, Russian authorities claimed that the shopping centre was not the target.\n\nHow to counter Russia and back Ukraine will be the focus of a summit this week of the western Nato alliance, whose support has been critical to Kyiv's ability to fend off Moscow's larger and better equipped forces.\n\nUkrainian leaders, however, say they need more and better weapons if they are to continue to hold off and even drive back Russia, which is pressing an all-out assault in Ukraine's eastern region of the Donbas.\n\nAs Mr Macron spoke, rescuers combed through the charred rubble of the shopping centre that authorities said was struck with more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers inside.\n\nSeveral of the bodies of those who did not make it out in time are burned beyond recognition and their identification could take days, he said.\n\nIn addition to the 18 killed, authorities said 59 were wounded. Another 21 people are still missing, Mr Monastyrsky said.\n\nThe attack recalled strikes earlier in the war that hit a theatre, a train station, and a hospital.\n\nAt Ukraine's request, the UN Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the attack.\n\nAs condemnation of the strike came in from many quarters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov struck a defiant note, saying Russia would press its offensive until it fulfils its goals.\n\nHe said the hostilities could stop \"before the end of the day\" if Ukraine were to surrender and meet Russia's demands, including recognising its control over territory it has taken by force.\n\nRussian defence ministry spokesman Lt Gen Igor Konashenkov claimed that warplanes fired precision-guided missiles at a depot that contained Western weapons and ammunition, which detonated and set the mall on fire.\n\nUkrainian officials have contradicted that, saying the shopping centre was hit directly.\n\nLt Gen Konashenkov said the depot was near a factory for road construction equipment.\n\nMykola Danileiko, a spokesman for that factory, confirmed that it was hit along with the mall, but insisted that there were no weapons there.\n\nElsewhere on Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a six-year-old child.\n\nA further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a three-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to local officials.\n\nThe unusually intense spate of fire in recent days came as the G7 leaders gathered in Europe.

Dozens of people who feared their loved ones had been inside the building when the deadly explosions ripped through it looked on in grim silence as a giant crane removed sections of the collapsed roof, exposing blackened debris and twisted metal underneath.\n\nAway from onlookers, rescue workers had placed a stretcher where they carefully placed fragments of charred human remains found in the rubble.\n\nAuthorities estimate that there were between 200 and 1000 people inside at the time of the attack. Many managed to flee to a nearby bomb shelter when they heard the air raid sirens. Others didn't make it in time and remained trapped inside. At least 18 people were killed and 21 are still missing.\n\nWhen the missile struck, at 3.53pm on Monday, it ignited a huge fire that took 300 emergency workers more than four hours to extinguish.\n\nMykola Lukash, from the Kremenchuk district prosecutor's office, said that members of his team had recovered dozens of body fragments.\n\n\"We need to carry out DNA tests to identify them,\" Lukash said. \"What concerns us are the 21 missing persons reports which had been submitted by locals searching for loved ones who had gone missing in the building.\"\n\nFor over 20 hours, military personnel, volunteers, firefighters and police have been working non-stop to recover bodies from the rubble in the hope of finding survivors.\n\n\"We pulled out several bodies, but there are definitely more trapped under the rubble,\" said Oleksii, 46, a firefighter. \"This is normally a very crowded place.\"\n\nEvery day, hundreds of people flock to the mall in Kremenchuk to do their shopping or have a coffee and a chat with friends. The only difference between this and any other shopping centre around the world is that here an unpredictable war is raging, one capable of destroying lives in a matter of seconds, even in a place hundreds of miles from the frontline or in cities that have never been bombed before. The truth is that nowhere in Ukraine is safe from Russian missiles or air raids.\n\n\"I left the building two minutes before the explosion,\" said Yevhenia Semyonova, 38, a shop assistant at a sportswear outlet inside the mall. \"My colleagues who are working in bigger stores, like the supermarket for example, had to wait for the customers to get out before they could leave. We were lucky because there were no customers in our store during the alarm.\n\n\"At the beginning of the war, all the shops stopped working during air sirens. But eventually people got used to it and started ignoring the sirens. Unfortunately that's what happened yesterday too. A lot of people I know and some friends are still missing.\"\n\nThe Guardian has seen a phone message allegedly sent by the local management of the mall on 23 June, urging employees not to leave the shopping centre when air raid sirens go off.\n\n\"Starting from today, this shopping centre will not close during the air alarms'', reads the message. \"The shopping centre works from 8am till 9pm. No breaks.\"\n\nAt least five employees confirmed they had received the message.\n\nA woman who worked in the supermarket inside the mall said she managed to escape immediately after the explosion.\n\n\"Usually on Mondays I was forced to take my little daughter to work because the kindergarten was closed. But luckily yesterday I found someone to take care of her while I was working. Some of my colleagues didn't make it. Someone will certainly still be there, under the rubble.\"\n\nOleksandra, who worked in a jewellery shop, was supposed to open her store today at 10am. \"I had a day off yesterday'', she said, tears streaming down her face as she surveyed the rubble. \"I had coffee with my colleagues here yesterday morning. There are some people I know who are missing. There was a huge toy store inside the mall. There could be children.''\n\nAs night fell in Kremenchuk on Monday, the burned-out building was illuminated by floodlights as emergency workers and soldiers combed through the rubbles, and relatives of those missing waited across the street.\n\n\"The relatives are confused and anxious,\", said Yulia Fesieieva, a senior psychologist of Poltava regional state emergency service. \"We observe and single out people who are visibly in distress. We approach them and introduce ourselves and try to help them. I've spoken to about 20 people so far.\"\n\nShe continued: \"There was a young man who was shaking, holding his dog in his arms. He was extremely nervous and in shock. He was trying to call his wife who had left the house with her best friend to buy food for their pet but she didn't pick up. In the end, fortunately, his wife left the building 10 minutes before the attack. But her best friend, unfortunately, decided to stay behind and continue shopping. She wasn't able to leave the building before the explosion and died in an intensive care unit.\"\n\nThe attack came on the day of a G7 meeting in Germany where leaders discussed ways to punish Moscow for its invasion and pledged to stand with Ukraine \"for as long as it takes\".\n\nUkraine's air force command said in a statement that Russia hit the mall, which is located near a railway station, with two X-22 cruise missiles that were fired from Tu-22M long-range bombers. According to Kyiv, the planes fired their rockets while in the sky over the Kursk region of Russia, located near the Ukrainian border.\n\nCommenting on the strike in his nightly video address, Volodymyr Zelenskiy called Russia \"the largest terrorist organisation in the world\".\n\nway line.\n\nOn Monday, Russia's ministry of defence claimed the fire in the shopping mall in Kremenchuk was caused by \"the detonation of stored ammunition for western weapons\". No evidence was offered to back up the claim.\n\nOutside the mall, Ukrainian police had set up a table where they had placed twisted bits of metal believed to be from the missiles.\n\nVolodymyr Vasylenko, 61, born and raised in Kremunchuk arrived on Tuesday morning at the site of the attack, to leave some flowers among the rubble. \"I don't know how and why we deserve this,\" he said. \"They want us to live in fear. But we must not be afraid. We can just continue to pray. Maybe this was God's plan so we could finally get the weapons we needed.

And though Russia continues to tell its people that its military operation's goal is to liberate their allegedly oppressed neighbors, the rest of the world is seeing a very different picture -- one in which indiscriminate violence wreaks havoc and terror on an invaded land.\n\nREAD MORE: 'I Was Flying Headfirst': A Shopping Trip Shattered by a Missile [The New York Times]", "source": {"uri": "futurism.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Futurism"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://wp-assets.futurism.com/2022/06/camera-footage-russian-missiles-hitting-ukraine-shopping-mall.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 8, "stanza_neu": 9, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 17, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094758893", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "11:31:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T11:31:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T11:31:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5098039507865906, "url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/russia-brags-about-airstrike-that-killed-20-at-ukrainian-shopping-mall", "title": "Russia Brags About Airstrike That Killed 20 at Ukrainian Shopping Mall ", "body": "As the death toll in Russia's airstrike on a Ukrainian shopping center full of civilians climbed to 20 on Tuesday, Russian defense officials took full responsibility for the attack -- and then bragged about it as a successful military operation.\n\nIgor Konashenkov, a spokesperson for Russia's defense ministry, described the attack on the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk in a Tuesday briefing, framing it as one of the Russian military's successful strikes against Ukrainian \"military facilities.\"\n\nHe said the \"high-accuracy strike\" was conducted not on a shopping mall, but on an arms depot, and that it had successfully destroyed \"Western-made weapons and ammunition\" intended for Ukrainian troops in the Donbas. Bizarrely, he blamed a fire at the arms depot for the damage at the Amstor shopping mall, which he claimed was \"non-functional.\"\n\nHe made no mention of the 20 civilians killed. An additional 59 people were injured in the strike.\n\nRussia's version of events is sure to infuriate Ukrainian authorities, who at a Tuesday briefing at the bombed out mall called BS on the Kremlin narrative, showing reporters the children's toys and consumer goods that were destroyed in what Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky described as a \"targeted hit on a civilian facility.\"\n\nPhotos of what was described as fragments of a Russian missile found at the scene also circulated in Ukrainian media.\n\nIn addition to the 20 fatalities confirmed by the Ukrainian presidential office Tuesday, many more people remain unaccounted for. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the presidential administration, put the figure at 40, while Monastyrsky said at least 21 remain unaccounted for.

Lysychansk is the last major area of the province under Ukrainian control following the retreat of Ukraine's forces from the neighboring city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nRussian troops and their separatist allies control 95% of Luhansk and about half of the Donetsk region, the other province that makes up the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Authorities in the city declared three days of mourning.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Services press officer Svitlana Rybalko told The Associated Press that along with the 18 people killed, investigators found fragments of eight more bodies. It was not immediately clear whether that meant there were more victims. A number of survivors suffered severed limbs.\n\n\"The police cannot say for sure how many (victims) there are.

The region borders EU and NATO members Poland and Lithuania.\n\n-- Russia's foreign ministry summoned Norway's charge d'affaires to protest Oslo's blocking of a shipment of supplies to a Russian coal-mining town in the Svalbard islands.\n\nAlthough the Svalbards are Norwegian territory, a 1920 treaty allows all signatory countries the right to exploit its natural resources. Russia operates a coal mine in Barentsburg, a settlement of about 450 people, which relies on shipments from the mainland of food, machinery and other supplies. Norway imposed sanctions on shipments from Russia in April.\n\n-- Ukrainian military intelligence says that in the largest prisoner swap since the start of the war 144 Ukrainian troops were released from Russian captivity. Of those released, 95 were involved in defending the Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's devastated southern city of Mariupol that Russian forces captured weeks ago.

The most likely scenario predicted by American intelligence, Haines said, is a \u201cgrinding struggle\u201d in which Russia consolidates its hold over southern Ukraine by the fall.\n\nThe US correctly predicted Russia would invade Ukraine in February, but was wrong in assessing that it would quickly seize Kyiv. Speaking at an event in Washington on Wednesday, Haines said Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201chas effectively the same political goals that he had previously, which is to say that he wants to take most of Ukraine\u201d and push it away from Nato.\n\n\u201cWe perceive a disconnect between Putin\u2019s near-term military objectives in this area and his military\u2019s capacity, a kind of mismatch between his ambitions and what the military is able to accomplish,\u201d Haines said.G20 boycott over Putin would leave floor to Russia and China, UK PM warns\n\nMeanwhile, crews continued to search through the rubble of the shopping centre in Kremenchuk where Ukrainian authorities say 20 people remain missing.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Services press officer Svitlana Rybalko told Associated Press that along with the 18 people killed, investigators found fragments of eight more bodies.

The prime minister said the government had already presided over the biggest increase in defence spending since the Cold War.\n\nSpeaking at the Royal United Services Institute land warfare conference in London, Mr Wallace said the \u00a324 billion increase announced in the 2020 spending review had been a \"strong start\".\n\nHowever he said more action was needed to reverse the cuts made by successive governments after the end of the Cold War when the threat of conflict with Russia subsided.\n\n\"If governments historically responded every time the NHS has a winter crisis so must they when the threat to the very security which underpins our way of life increases,\" he said.\n\nThe United States is actively trying to resolve WNBA star Brittney Griner's detention in Russia, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Tuesday, reiterating Washington's call for Moscow to release her.\n\n\"The United States government is actively engaged in trying to resolve this case and get Brittney home,\" Mr Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One, declining to give any details.\n\nMs Griner has been held since February and faces up to 10 years in prison after Russian officials alleged her luggage contained multiple cannabis oil vape cartridges.

The whole place was collapsing,\" she said at a nearby public hospital where she was being treated.\n\n\"It was hell,\" said her husband, Mykola, 45, blood seeping through a bandage around his head.\n\nExhausted fire fighters sat on a curb alongside another of the shopping centre's walls.

We didn't find anybody alive,\" said a fire fighter who gave his name only as Oleksandr.\n\nOutside the hospital, a small group of mall workers were filled with worry and grief, but also relief.\n\nHearing an air-raid siren, they had made their way to a nearby basement when the missiles struck, said Roman, 28, who asked to be identified by only one name.\n\nHe added that many others had stayed inside as the mall's management had three days ago allowed shops to remain open during air raid sirens.\n\nMany Ukrainians have stopped reacting to the now regular warning sirens as strikes have been occurring less frequently outside of Ukraine's battle-torn east.\n\nBack in the intensive-care ward, Yulia, a 21-year-old woman covered with deep cuts, said Monday was her first day working in one of the stores in the mall.\n\n14:41 , Thomas Kingsley\n\nRussian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday the more western countries send weapons to Ukraine the longer the conflict will last.\n\nRussia has repeatedly blamed the west for prolonging the conflict, which Moscow calls a \"special military operation\", and has targeted missile strikes against arms depots storing weapons provided to Kyiv by the United States and Europe.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference during a visit to Turkmenistan, Lavrov said Russia did not target a shopping centre in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk on Monday, where at least 18 people died following a Russian strike.\n\nEchoing a statement issued by Russia's defence ministry earlier on Tuesday, Lavrov told reporters the mall was empty at the time a fire occurred as a result of Russia hitting an arms depot storing western weapons that was next to the shopping centre.\n\n14:10 , Thomas Kingsley\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron told the G7 summit that Russia had one goal in mind - the surrender of Ukraine.\n\n\"Right now, it is clear, Russia's attack on Ukraine's territory has one objective - the surrender of Ukraine,\" said Mr Macron.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G-7 summit in Germany, Macron appeared to address that concern, vowing that the seven industrialized democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \"as long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\"\n\n\"Russia cannot and should not win,\" he said, adding that Monday's attack on the mall was \"a new war crime.\"\n\n13:50 , Thomas Kingsley\n\nOn the eve of the Nato summit, Baltic states are urging the military alliance to increase the number of troops earmarked to defend their corner of Europe against Russia to as many as 25,000 after secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg promised the \"biggest overhaul of its collective deterrence and defence since the Cold War\".\n\nTop of the agenda in the meeting in Madrid, which starts in earnest on Wednesday, is Moscow's invasion of Ukraine which has sparked a geopolitical shift, even prompting once neutral countries Finland and Sweden to apply to join Nato.\n\nRead more below from our international correspondent, Bel Trew:\n\nWe could be next: Fearful Baltic states urge Nato for more troops\n\n13:27 , Thomas Kingsley\n\nFirefighters and soldiers searched on Tuesday for survivors in the rubble of a Ukrainian shopping mall, where authorities said 36 people were still missing after a Russian missile strike that had killed at least 18.\n\nRelatives of the missing were lined up on Tuesday at a hotel across the street from the wreckage of the shopping centre, where rescue workers had set up a base.\n\nExhausted-looking firefighters sat on a kerb after a night battling the blaze and searching for survivors, mostly in vain. Oleksandr, wetting his face from a water bottle on a bench, said his team had worked all night picking through the rubble.\n\n\"We pulled out five bodies. We didn't find anybody alive,\" he said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of deliberately targetting civilians in the attack in the city of Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, far from the frontline. He called it \"one of the most defiant terrorist attacks in European history\".\n\nRussia said the incident was caused by a strike on a legitimate military target. Its defence ministry said it had fired missiles at an arms depot for Western weapons, where an explosion of ammunition caused the blaze at the nearby mall.\n\n13:00 , Thomas Kingsley\n\nA Moscow court jauled prominent Russian opposition politician Ilya Yashin for 15 days on Tuesday for disobeying a police officer.\n\nYashin, a municipal deputy for Moscow's Krasnoselsky district, was detained on Monday. \"The case against me is trumped up, I am innocent,\" Yashin said on his Telegram social media channel, linking his detention to his political activities.\n\nYashin is an outspoken critic of Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine, which it calls a \"special military operation\".\n\nUK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said he did not think Britain would end up at war with Russia.\n\nAsked if Britain was preparing for war with Russia, he told reporters at the G7 summit: \"I don't think it will come to that and clearly we're working very hard to make sure that we confine this to Ukraine.\"\n\nIt comes as new UK army chief Patrick Sanders said Britain must be ready to fight Russia as the threat of war grows. He added that the Kremlin will be an even greater threat to European security after the war and the army must be ready to fight to \"avert conflict.\"\n\n\"We're not at war, but we must act rapidly so that we aren't drawn into one through a failure to contain territorial expansion,\" he said.\n\nHe said the army should focus on boosting readiness so troops could be deployed quickly, and on urban combat and rebuilding stockpiles. He described the choice facing Britain as its \"1937 moment\" in what appeared to be a reference to when Nazi leader Adolf Hitler invaded Austria.\n\n12:05 , Thomas Kingsley\n\nG7 leaders urged China on Tuesday to uphold the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes by pressing Russia to stop its invasion of Ukraine and to drop its \"expansive maritime claims\" in the South China Sea.\n\nIn a communique concluding their three-day summit in the Bavarian Alps, the G7 leaders also said they were gravely concerned by the human rights situation in China and that they were consulting on collective approaches to challenges posed by non-market economic policies.\n\n11:50 , Thomas Kingsley\n\nLeaders of the world's wealthiest democracies struck a united stance Tuesday to support Ukraine for \"as long as necessary\" as Russia's invasion grinds on, and said they would explore far-reaching steps to cap Kremlin income from oil sales that are financing the war.\n\nThe final statement from the Group of Seven summit in Germany left out key details on how the fossil fuel price caps would work in practice, setting up more discussion in the weeks ahead to \"explore\" measures to bar import of Russian oil above a certain level. That would hit a key Russian source of income and, in theory, relieve the energy price spikes afflicting the global economy as a result of the war.\n\nLeaders also agreed on a ban on imports of Russian gold and to step up aid to countries hit with food shortages by the blockage on Ukraine grain shipments through the Black Sea.\n\n11:37 , Thomas Kingsley\n\nRussian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov will attend the Group of 20 (G20) foreign ministers' meeting in Bali next week, a spokesperson for the Russian embassy in Jakarta told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nThe meeting, hosted by current G20 chair Indonesia takes place from 7-8 July.\n\n11:21 , Thomas Kingsley\n\nRussia will likely be an even greater threat to European security after the war in Ukraine than it was before and the British army must be prepared, its Chief of the General Staff Patrick Sanders said on Tuesday.\n\nMr Sanders, who became chief of the general staff this month, used his first speech to warn that the army must be ready to fight to \"avert conflict\", in what appeared to be an appeal for modernisation and possibly further defence spending.\n\n\"We don't know how the war in Ukraine will end. But in most scenarios Russia will be an even greater threat to European security after Ukraine than it was before.\"\n\nHe said the army should focus on boosting readiness so troops could be deployed quickly, and on urban combat and rebuilding stockpiles. He described the choice facing Britain as its \"1937 moment\" in what appeared to be a reference to when Nazi leader Adolf Hitler invaded Austria.\n\n\"We're not at war, but we must act rapidly so that we aren't drawn into one through a failure to contain territorial expansion,\" he said.\n\n11:05 , Thomas Kingsley\n\nRussia's defence ministry on Tuesday denied hitting a shopping mall in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk with missiles, saying it had struck a weapons depot and a subsequent explosion of ammunition had triggered a fire in the nearby mall.\n\nAt least 18 people were killed on Monday in what Kyiv said was a direct Russian missile strike against the busy shopping centre in Kremenchuk. The G7 called the hit a Russian war crime, while Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said it was \"one of the most defiant terrorist attacks in European history,\" accusing Russia of directly targeting civilians.\n\nMoscow on Tuesday rejected those accounts, saying it had hit a legitimate military target in the city, and that the shopping centre was not in use.\n\n\"In Kremenchuk, Russian forces struck a weapons depot storing arms received from the United States and Europe with high-precision air-based weapons. As a result of the precision strike, Western-made weapons and ammunition concentrated in the warehouse ... were hit,\" Moscow's defence ministry said in a statement posted on its Telegram channel.\n\n\"The detonation of stored ammunition for Western weapons caused a fire in a non-functioning shopping centre located next to the depot,\" it added.\n\n10:45 , Thomas Kingsley\n\nA Moscow court said it had fined video streaming service Twitch, social network Pinterest and United Parcel Service in three of several cases expected on Tuesday over alleged refusal by foreign companies to store Russian citizens' personal data in Russia.\n\nMoscow has clashed with Big Tech over content, censorship, data and local representation in a simmering dispute that has erupted into a full-on information battle since the invasion started.\n\nRussia's communications regulator Roskomnadzor in late May opened administrative cases against Alphabet Inc's Google and six other foreign technology companies, including Amazon-owned Twitch, Pinterest and UPS , for alleged violations of personal data legislation.\n\nThe Moscow courts' press service said Twitch had been found guilty by the Tagansky District Court of violating Russian personal data legislation and fined 2 million roubles ($37,700). Pinterest was also fined 2 million roubles, news agencies reported, and UPS 1 million roubles.\n\nTwitch, Pinterest and UPS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n10:15 , Thomas Kingsley\n\nMoscow has announced that is placing sanctions on the wife and daughter of US President Joe Biden.\n\nThe decision is part of a new package of sanctions announced by Russia on 25 American individuals.\n\nRead the developing news below:\n\nRussia sanctions First Lady Jill Biden and daughter Ashley\n\n10:04 , Thomas Kingsley\n\nG7 leaders are working on finding a way of letting Ukraine export its grain, British prime minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday.\n\n\"We're working on it, we're all working on it,\" he said at the start of a five-way meeting with France's Emmanuel Macron, Italy's Mario Draghi, Germany's Olaf Scholz and the US's Joe Biden, when asked if they were going to get the grain out of Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's bulk grain exports are being hindered by a Russian blockade of its Black Sea ports, forcing exporters to use less efficient land routes.\n\n09:42 , Thomas Kingsley\n\nRussia will likely be an even greater threat to European security after the war in Ukraine than it was before, the British army's chief of the general staff Patrick Sanders said on Tuesday.\n\n\"While Russia's conventional capability will be much reduced for a time at least, (Russian president Vladimir) Putin's declared intent recently to restore the lands of historic Russia makes any respite temporary and the threat will become even more acute,\" Mr Sanders said in a speech.\n\n\"We don't know how the war in Ukraine will end. But in most scenarios Russia will be an even greater threat to European security after Ukraine than it was before.\"\n\nG7 leaders have agreed to study placing price caps on imports of Russian oil and gas to try to limit Moscow's ability to fund its invasion of Ukraine, G7 officials said on Tuesday.\n\nThe European Union will explore with international partners ways to curb energy prices, including the feasibility of introducing temporary import price caps, a section of the final G7 communique seen by Reuters said. The officials said this meant both oil and gas.\n\nThe Group of Seven rich nations have been debating a global price cap for Russian energy to prevent Moscow profiting from its invasion of Ukraine, which has sharply raised oil and gas prices.\n\nRussian oil export revenues climbed in May even though sanctions reduced its export volumes, the International Energy Agency said in its June monthly report.\n\n08:40 , Thomas Kingsley\n\nTechnology minister Chris Philp told Sky News that a Russian attack on a shopping centre in Ukraine was \"sickening and appalling\".\n\nRussian missiles slammed into a shopping centre in Kremenchuk on Monday, prompting international condemnation.\n\nMr Philps likened it to an \"act of terrorism\", as he pointed to UK efforts to support Ukraine in the war.\n\nHe was asked about comments by general Sir Patrick Sanders, the chief of the general staff, who has likened the current situation to the run up to the Second World War.\n\n\"I think that refers to the fact we need to do everything we can to support Ukraine.\n\n\"We don't want to see an escalation into a wider conflict. I think Russia would be literally insane to attempt to do that, because Nato is a far larger and far stronger bloc.\"\n\n08:22 , Thomas Kingsley\n\nDefence secretary Ben Wallace is set to issue a call for a significant hike in government spending on the UK's armed forces in the face of Russian aggression.\n\nThe senior cabinet minister has reportedly asked Boris Johnson to increase the country's military spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP - an additional 20 per cent a year.\n\nIn a letter, Mr Wallace urged him to call on fellow Nato leaders to raise their own spending from the current minimum target of 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent of national income, according to Talk TV.\n\nOur political correspondent, Adam Forrest, has the full story below:\n\nBen Wallace 'asks Boris Johnson for 20% hike in defence spending'\n\n08:01 , Thomas Kingsley\n\nAs war rages on in Ukraine, a journalist who has been running a Twitter thread of developments since the conflict began, will be on hand to answer reader questions.\n\nTim White, who tweets under the handle @TWMCLtd, is a documentary maker specialising in Ukraine and eastern Europe and appeared on a recent panel event run by The Independent: Deciphering Russia's misinformation: How do we sort fact from fiction?\n\nRead below for more details on how to get a ticket to the event:\n\nExpert on Russia Ukraine war to answer your questions in 'Ask Me Anything'\n\n07:40 , Thomas Kingsley\n\nThe death toll from the Kremenchuk airstrike has been increased to 18, the State Emergency Services of Ukraine has confirmed.\n\nIn a statement today, the service said: \"Search and rescue operations continue, damaged construction structures and being disassembled using heavy engineering equipment and small machinery.\n\n\"The units of the dsns examined and analyzed the debris of construction structures at 60 per cent of the total area of the object.\n\n\"As a result of the bombing of the mall, 18 people were killed (of which 1 person died in the hospital).\"\n\n\"59 people applied for medical assistance, 25 of them were hospitalized to the hospital of intensive care.\"\n\nA warning from the new Army chief that Ukraine is our \"1937 moment\" is front page of The Daily Telegraph.\n\nUkrainian forces continue to disrupt Russian command and control with successful strikes deep behind Russian lines, the UK ministry of defence says in its latest update.\n\nIt says Ukrainian troops are consolidating their positions on higher ground in the city of Lyschansak, after falling back from Sievierodonetsk.\n\nThe latest intelligence update also says that the wave of missile attacks launched by Moscow earlier included weapons like the Soviet-era AS-4 KITCHEN and more modern AS-23a KODIAK missiles, which were fired from both Belarusian and Russian airspace.\n\n\"These weapons were designed to take on targets of strategic importance, but Russia continues to expend them in large numbers for tactical advantage.\"\n\nThe defence ministry said that despite fielding the core elements of six different armies, Russia only achieved tactical success at Sievierodonetsk, adding that the Russian armed forces are \"increasingly hollowed out\".\n\n06:45 , Stuti Mishra\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin is set to make his first international visit since the Ukrainian invasion today amid strong condemnation from the G7 after the Kremenchuk airstrike.\n\n\"A working visit by President Putin is scheduled for tomorrow in Tajikistan,\" Dmitry Peskov said on Monday of the visit to the former Soviet republic and Moscow ally.\n\nMr Putin will meet Tajik president Emomali Rahmon, a close Russian ally and the longest-serving ruler of Tajikistan.\n\nThe warning comes as Boris Johnson prepares to join other Nato leaders in Madrid for a summit at which they are expected to agree the biggest overhaul of the Western military alliance since the end of the Cold War.\n\n\"This is our 1937 moment. We are not at war - but must act rapidly so that we aren't drawn into one through a failure to contain territorial expansion.\n\nUkrainian representatives at the UN have requested for a security council meeting today to discuss the Russian airstrike at the crowded Kremenchuk shopping centre where scores of civilians are believed to have died, according to CNN.\n\nUN under-secretary-general for political and peacebuilding affairs will brief the council at the meeting, which is scheduled for 3pm ET, a UN spokesperson told CNN.\n\nThe airstrike left at least 16 people dead with 59 wounded.\n\n05:26 , Stuti Mishra\n\n\"Often as not, it is what doesn't come out of an international summit that is the important thing - and right now that is heartbreakingly true of the G7 leaders.

I got in my car and parked about 500 metres from the building.\n\n'The police were there and there were many people wounded.

Many of the dead were refugees fleeing west, away from the escalating fighting in Donbas.\n\nIt is this attack that came to mind when on Monday 27 June, a similar strike on a busy shopping centre in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk was confirmed to have killed at least 20. Though the death toll will likely rise over the coming days. Ukrainian officials estimate that 1,000 people were inside the shopping centre at the time of the attack.\n\nBoth strikes appear to have been indiscriminate attacks on cities that had been spared much fighting. Both utilised highly advanced weaponry to target buildings with no apparent military purpose, which Russian forces would have known contained civilians. Even if they did host legitimate targets under international law, targeting them would still have been illegal: the civilian casualties in both cases were too disproportionate to allow the strikes to go ahead.\n\nThe purpose of Russia's brutal tactics is clear: to sow terror into the hearts of Ukrainian defenders and civilians. There is no way that Russian forces could have not known that a railway station would have been full of civilians at 10.30am, when the Tochka-U ballistic missile hit Kramatorsk station; similarly, the recent targeting of the shopping centre in Kremenchuk could only have been intended to kill civilians.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defence has admitted responsibility for the attack on Kremenchuk, saying in a statement that its forces hit an ammunition storage facility in the city, the detonation of which \"caused a fire in a non-functioning shopping centre located next to the plant\". The admission of responsibility came after Russia's deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, claimed the attack was a fake Ukrainian \"provocation\". He compared it to Bucha, the suburb of Kyiv where hundreds of Ukrainians were found to have been murdered by Russian troops in the early days of the war.\n\nAlong with cruise missile attacks on the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv, the first for weeks, the targeting of Kremenchuk sends a message to Ukrainians: nowhere in their country is safe. More than that, the bombings signal that Russia is willing and able to use overwhelming force to punish Ukrainian counterattacks.\n\nOlga Musafirova, Ukraine correspondent for the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta Europe, wrote that central Kyiv could be targeted in retaliation for Western countries providing multiple-launch rocket systems, which Ukraine has requested. Or if it attempts to retake occupied Kherson. Or if it targets the bridge connecting occupied Crimea with the Russian mainland. Resistance will be punished with terror.\n\nIn a sense, Russia's increasingly brutal tactics are a return to form. Its wars - from Chechnya in the 1990s to Syria from 2015 - are characterised by indiscriminate bombing of cities until they are all but razed to the ground, and the flag of Russia or its proxies is raised over the ruins. First Grozny, then Aleppo, then Mariupol. Russia's military is effective at waging wars of annihilation involving the heavy use of artillery and terror tactics; that is how it is now making slow - if consistent - progress in Donbas. It is less effective at prosecuting regime change \"special operations\", the ill-fated initial aim of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe recent strikes came ahead of two pivotal summits among Western countries. At the G7, held in southern Germany on 26-28 June, leaders of the world's richest democracies agreed to ban imports of Russian gold and explore a price cap on Russian energy, intended to limit the Kremlin's benefits from rising energy costs. That summit is to be followed by a meeting of Nato in Madrid on 28-30 June, which is expected to see the alliance define Russia as a threat and beef up its capabilities for the defence of the Baltic states, which fear that they could be Vladimir Putin's next targets.\n\nIf anything, the attacks on Kremenchuk, Kyiv and Lviv signal that the Kremlin is committed to the war in Ukraine. Kyiv is worried about \"war fatigue\" setting in among Western populations as their attention turns towards the cost of living and the prospect of a difficult winter. Moscow has no such fear.", "source": {"uri": "newstatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Statesman"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.newstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/RTS9212N-800x418.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.6705882352941177, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 18, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 31, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094788355", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "11:56:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T11:56:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T11:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4980392158031464, "url": "https://www.scotsman.com/news/world/zelensky-shopping-centre-attack-one-of-most-daring-terrorist-attacks-in-european-history-3748091", "title": "Zelensky: Shopping centre attack 'one of most daring terrorist attacks in European history'", "body": "The Russian strike echoed earlier attacks that caused large numbers of civilian casualties - such as one in March on a Mariupol theatre where many civilians were sheltering, killing hundreds of people - and another in April on a train station in eastern Kramatorsk that killed at least 59 people.\n\nMr Zelensky's comments came as an extensive investigation by Amnesty International has concluded that Russian military forces committed a war crime when they struck the Mariupol drama theatre.\n\nIn a new report, 'Children': The Attack on the Donetsk Regional Academic Drama Theatre in Mariupol, Ukraine, the organisation documents how the Russian military likely deliberately targeted the theatre despite knowing hundreds of civilians were sheltering there on 16 March, making the attack a clear war crime.\n\nCasualty figures rose as rescuers sifted through the rubble.

Kyiv called the strike a terrorist act and an \"unintentional attack on a civilian target.\" Russian officials initially claimed the attack was a \"Bucha-style false flag,\" but the Russian Defense Ministry soon acknowledged that a strike had indeed occurred. In Russia's telling, however, a strike \"on a foreign munitions warehouse\" caused some of the weapons stored there to detonate, damaging a nearby defunct shopping mall. Meduza explains the holes in Russia's story.\n\nAt around 4:00 pm on June 27, there was a powerful explosion in the center of Kremenchuk, and almost ten seconds later, there was another. At the same time, the Amstor shopping mall caught on fire. Within several hours, it had burned to the ground.\n\nThe city authorities reported that evening that 19 bodies had been found at the fire scene and that another person had died in the hospital. About 40 other people who had been in the mall were now missing. Over 50 people had injuries, most of which were burns.\n\nUkraine's Interior Ministry reported that the strikes were carried out by Kh-22 missiles launched from Tu-22 bombers that had taken off from the Shaykovka air base in Russia's Kaluga region.\n\nThe Kremenchuk authorities later showed journalists a giant crater and a destroyed production facility at a road machinery plant close to the Amstor mall. The hole is about a third of a mile from the shopping center, which would seem to confirm the Russian Defense Ministry's version of events; according to the Ministry, they had launched a strike on the plant because Ukraine had been storing weapons there, and that some of the weapons had detonated, setting the mall nearby on fire. But that story is false.\n\nOn June 28, several videos from surveillance cameras in a Kremenchuk city park were posted online. The park is located directly behind the road machinery plant, halfway between the plant and the Amstor mall. At the start of the video, the people and the birds at the park are visibly alarmed, presumably by a distant explosion; ten seconds later, a second explosion can be seen -- this one much closer.\n\nBased on the layout of the things seen in the videos, it's clear that the second explosion was the one at the road machinery plant. It's not possible to determine the epicenter of the first explosion based on the footage, but in one of the videos, a heavy column of smoke can be seen rising behind the plant from the approximate location of the mall.\n\nIn addition, Meduza has obtained photos taken on the day of the attack from a higher elevation about two miles from the Amstor mall. The person who sent the photos asked Meduza not only not to use his name, but also not to publish the photos themselves, as they could be used to determine where he lives, and publishing images of possible military targets can bring criminal charges in Ukraine. Meduza was unable to confirm his claims regarding the photos' origin, but also found no evidence to suggest the photos had been forged.\n\nThe photos show two explosions of similar size; the smoke in the upper part of the mushroom cloud over one of them has already begun to dissipate, suggesting that that one occurred slightly earlier. Meduza has geolocated the location where the photo was taken, as well as the approximate locations of the explosions: the first explosion (whose smoke had begun to dissipate) happened at or near the mall, while the second happened at or near the road machinery plant.\n\nThe photos (which appear to have been taken consecutively over roughly a half-hour period) don't show any signs of secondary munitions detonations (such as what happened, for example, in March 2022 after a missile strike on Kyiv's Retroville mall, where the Ukrainian military was hiding artillery and shells). The smoke from the explosions simply continues to dissipate, and the fire can be seen breaking out at the mall.\n\nBy comparing satellite images from April and from June 28, it's possible to determine where exactly the missile landed near the Amstor mall. In addition to the destruction at the mall, the June images show what is presumably the crater left by the missile; it's right next to the single-track railway that divides the mall from the plant. The likely impact site is about a hundred feet from the mall -- specifically from a store called Comfy, which had more victims and missing persons after the strike than any other store, according to mall employees, because the store caught on fire immediately after the explosion. Security camera footage showing the missile strike confirms the location (the coordinates can be seen here).\n\nBased on this evidence, we can safely conclude that the first missile detonated in the immediate vicinity of Amstor, and that the second missile hit the production facility at the road machinery plant. The evidence also suggests that there was no \"detonation of munitions,\" which the Russian Defense Ministry claims was the cause of the fire at the Amstor mall (at the very least, in the days since the explosion, no evidence has appeared to suggest that any munitions were detonated).\n\nThat leaves one question: was there ammunition or any other military equipment at the plant? So far, the Russian Defense Ministry has made this claim without presenting any evidence. The Ukrainian authorities and the plant's management have denied it, and none of the journalists reporting at the scene have found any sign of munitions at the plant.\n\nJudging by the evidence at the strike site, it's difficult to conclude that Russia's airstrike was a \"deliberate attack\" on the Amstor mall. The missile didn't hit the mall directly. Its most crowded section, the Silpo supermarket, suffered almost no damage in the initial minutes after the attack, according to mall employees (but it was later destroyed in the fire). Technically, while one of the missiles landed in the immediate vicinity of the mall, both of them landed on the territory of the nearby road machinery plant. It stands to reason that the plant was the target of both strikes.\n\nThe rest can be explained by the particular features of the missiles used to carry out the strikes (based on the Ukrainian authorities' reports that they were Kh-22s). These missiles were developed in the 1960s (and modernized in the 1970s) and intended not for precise strikes on ground targets but for attacks on large groups of NATO ships and aircraft carriers.\n\nThe missiles have two possible guidance systems:\n\nNo. this attack has all the hallmarks of a war crime -- one of many committed Russia in its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe shelling of the mall in Kremenchuk shows that when Russia's military commanders are planning a strike, they prioritize effectiveness and cost above all else -- including civilian lives.", "source": {"uri": "meduza.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "Meduza"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://meduza.io/imgly/share/1656485919/en/feature/2022/06/29/the-kremenchuk-missile-strike-what-the-evidence-shows", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 22, "stanza_neu": 24, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 47, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7096393194", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-29", "time": "14:47:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-29T14:47:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-29T14:47:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4941176474094391, "url": "https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/06/29/in-photos-ukrainian-shopping-center-lies-in-ruins-following-russian-missile-strike-a78147", "title": "In Photos: Ukrainian Shopping Center Lies in Ruins Following Russian Missile Strike", "body": "A Russian missile struck a shopping center in Kremenchuk, central Ukraine on Monday, killing at least 20 people and injuring dozens more in what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has blasted as a \"brazen terrorist attack.\"\n\nRussia maintains that the mall hadn't been open during the strike and that its forces were targeting a nearby stockpile of Western-supplied weapons -- a version of events that Ukraine denies.\n\nDays later, rescuers are still working to recover victims from the rubble:", "source": {"uri": "themoscowtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Moscow Times"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.themoscowtimes.com/image/og/de/78147__de7b0407a00e10d48b04c20be8581854.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.6549019607843137, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 1, "stanza_neu": 2, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 3, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094134876", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "23:57:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T23:57:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T23:21:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4941176474094391, "url": "https://au.news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-mall-attack-war-crime-232123812.html", "title": "Ukrainian mall attack is a war crime: G7", "body": "The leaders of the G7 group of industrialised nations have condemned a Russian missile strike on a crowded shopping centre in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk, describing the \"abominable attack\" as a \"war crime\".\n\n\"Indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.

Here's today's news.\n\nJAN. 6 ATTACK\n\nFederal agents have seized the phone of John Eastman, a lawyer who advised former President Trump on key elements of the effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The seizure, which was included in a court filing by Eastman yesterday, is the latest evidence that the Justice Department is stepping up its criminal investigation into the various strands of Trump's efforts to remain in power. Prosecutors are also investigating former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark for charges that include conspiracy to obstruct the certification of the presidential election, a warrant issued by the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General has indicated. Alan Feuer and Adam Goldman report for the New York Times.\n\nThe committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack has abruptly scheduled a hearing for this afternoon to hear \"recently obtained evidence\" and take witness testimony. The announcement - and its sudden and secretive nature - has stirred a wave of speculation about a potentially explosive revelation. Luke Broadwater and Maggie Haberman report for the New York Times.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is expected to testify today before the select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack, sources familiar with the matter have revealed. Hutchinson has already been interviewed by the committee behind closed doors and video clips from her deposition have been featured by the panel during earlier hearings. However, her live testimony would mark a significant moment in the committee's series of hearings as Hutchinson has long been considered one of its most consequential witnesses due to her proximity to Trump's then-White House chief of staff. Ryan Nobles, Zachary Cohen and Annie Grayer report for CNN.\n\nToday's hearing is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. EST. Live coverage is provided by the January 6th Committee Media Center.\n\nOTHER DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS\n\nAt least 46 people were found dead yesterday in a tractor-trailer in San Antonio, according to city officials. The people are believed to be migrants who were being transported to the U.S. in a smuggling operation, according to a statement from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It's the highest number of fatalities ever in a suspected migrant smuggling operation in the U.S., said federal officials with knowledge of the incident. San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood said his department transported 16 survivors to hospitals, four of whom were teenagers or young adults. Alicia A. Caldwell and Talal Ansari report for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE - ATTACK ON KREMENCHUK SHOPPING MALL\n\nAt least 18 people have been killed following a missile strike on the Amstory shopping mall in Kremenchuk, central Ukraine, according to this morning's figures. 36 are also believed to be missing and 25 are in hospital. Authorities estimate there could have been anywhere between 200 and 1,000 people inside the shopping centre when it was targeted. Many managed to flee to a nearby bomb shelter but others remain trapped in the building, reports suggest. Rescue workers are continuing to search the rubble. BBC News reports.\n\nGroup of Seven leaders meeting in Germany called the attack on the shopping mall a \"war crime\" in a statement yesterday night. The leaders condemned Russia's missile strike on the shopping centre in Kremenchuk, saying in a joint statement: \"Indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime.\" The leaders have promised to support Ukraine \"for as long as it takes\" and have pledged to impose new sanctions on Moscow to limit its ability to import technologies for its arms industry. BBC News reports.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated his call for the U.S. to name Russia a state sponsor of terrorism -- a designation that would trigger significant penalties -- after the Russian missile strike on the Kremenchuk shopping mall. Zelensky called the strike \"one of the most defiant terrorist attacks in European history\" in an address yesterday evening. Annabelle Timsit, Amy Cheng and Andrew Jeong report for the Washington Post.\n\nRussia's defense ministry has admitted responsibility for the missile strike on the shopping mall in Kremenchuk but said it had hit a military target and denied reports of civilian casualties. Russia claimed that it had hit a weapons depot in a factory with high-precision air-based missiles in a strike on U.S. and European munitions supplies for Ukrainian armed forces. \"The detonation of the munitions for western weaponry in storage led to a fire in a non-functioning shopping centre next to the factory,\" defense ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. Max Seddon reports for the Financial Times.\n\nDmitry Polyanskiy, a deputy Russian ambassador to the United Nations, previously suggested on Twitter that the explosion and fire at the shopping mall had been caused by the Ukrainians themselves. He described it as a \"provocation\" by Ukraine intended to keep attention on the country before an annual meeting of NATO countries in Madrid. Valerie Hopkins, Ivan Nechepurenko, Megan Specia and Dan Bilefsky report for the New York Times.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE - OTHER FIGHTING\n\nRussian forces shelled central districts of the city of Kharkiv yesterday, hitting apartment buildings and a primary school and killing five people and wounding 22. All of those affected by the attack were \"civilians of Kharkiv, who were walking on the streets, on playgrounds,\" the regional governor Oleh Synehubov said in a Telegram post. Five children were among the injured, he added. Vitalii Hnidyi reports for Reuters.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE - NATO SUMMIT\n\nPresident Biden and other NATO heads of state and government will gather in Madrid today for a three-day summit focused on urgent support for Ukraine as well as the alliance's longer-term strategy. The meeting comes a day after NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced that the number of alliance forces kept at a high readiness level will increase sharply -- to more than 300,000 troops from 40,000 -- in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In Madrid, NATO leaders and officials are set to discuss a more responsive force model, debate plans to bolster NATO's eastern flank and release a new strategy document, diplomats said. Allies are also expected to announce additional financial and military support for Ukraine. Emily Rauhala and Loveday Morris report for the Washington Post.\n\nTurkey wants results not \"empty words\" from Sweden and Finland if it is to approve their bids for Nato membership, president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan warned ahead of the NATO summit in Madrid. The Turkish president said that Ankara would block the accession of the two Nordic nations if it felt they had offered no tangible commitments on combating the activities of Kurdish militias that Turkey views as terrorists. Erdo\u011fan, whose nation has been a Nato member since 1952, is due to hold a four-way summit with the prime minister of Sweden and the president of Finland along with Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg today. Laura Pitel reports for the Financial Times.\n\nAny encroachment on the Crimea peninsula by a NATO member-state could amount to a declaration of war on Russia and lead to \"World War Three,\" Russia's former president, Dmitry Medvedev, said yesterday. \"For us, Crimea is a part of Russia. And that means forever. Any attempt to encroach on Crimea is a declaration of war against our country,\" Medvedev told the news website Argumenty i Fakty. \"And if this is done by a NATO member-state, this means conflict with the entire North Atlantic alliance; a World War Three. A complete catastrophe.\" Reuters reports.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE - GROUP OF SEVEN SUMMIT\n\nThe Group of Seven (G7) will pledge to spend $5 billion this year to help ensure food security around the globe, in an effort to counter global food shortages caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. An announcement about the commitment is expected to come today when the leaders of the G7 wealthy democracies issue their final statement after two days of meetings in the German Alps. The New York Times reports.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appealed yesterday to G7 leaders for more support from allies to push Russia out of newly conquered territories before winter. Zelensky told the leaders during a video address, that the harsh Ukrainian winter would make it more difficult for his troops to defend their positions and maintain supply lines to the front. Ukraine aims to push Russia back to the separation line before the February invasion, Zelensky said, according to officials present at the address. Tarini Parti, Bojan Pancevski and Alex Leary report for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nOTHER U.S. RELATIONS\n\nThe U.S. conducted an airstrike in Syria yesterday that killed a suspected militant leader affiliated with al Qaeda, the U.S. military has announced. The attack, which was carried out in Syria's Idlib province, targeted Abu Hamzah al Yemeni, whom the U.S. Central Command said was a senior leader of the al Qaeda-affiliated Hurras al-Din organization. The strike is notable because so few strikes targeting al Qaeda have been conducted recently. Gordon Lubold and Michael R. Gordon report for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIndirect talks between Iran and the U.S. will start today in Qatar's capital, the Iranian foreign ministry has said. The meeting comes amid a push by the E.U. to break a months-long impasse in negotiation to revive the 2015 nuclear deal. Negotiations stalled chiefly over Tehran's insistence that Washington remove the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), from the U.S. Foreign Terrorist Organization list (FTO). Last week, one Iranian and one European official indicated that Iran had dropped its demand for the removal of the IRGC's FTO sanctions, but two issues, including one on sanctions, remained to be resolved. Parisa Hafezi and Andrew Mills report for Reuters.\n\nJust Security has published a piece by Brian Rosen on the action the Biden Administration must take in order to walk Iran back from the nuclear brink.\n\nOTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nMohammed Zubair, an Indian journalist and prominent critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was arrested yesterday over posts he made on Twitter. Zubair, co-founder of the fact-checking site Alt News, was charged with violating two federal laws: \"doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony\" and \"deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class.\" Suman Nalwa, a spokeswoman for the Delhi police, confirmed in a phone interview that the charges were based on Zubair's Twitter posts, but would not comment on the content of the posts themselves.

This is exactly what the Kyiv regime needs to keep the focus on Ukraine in the run up to the [June 28] NATO summit,\" in Madrid.\n\nThe next day Igor Konashenkov, spokesman of Russia's Ministry of Defence, said at a press briefing that the country's air force had carried out a \"high precision air attack at hangars where armament and munitions were stored\" delivered by the US and European countries at the Kremenchuk road machinery plant, which is a few hundred metres north ofAmstor shopping mall.\n\nThe shopping mall, he added, was non-functioning and that it had caught fire as a result of the strikes on targets nearby.\n\nRussian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov also blamed western media for misrepresenting the situation. \"The Ministry of Defence has clearly explained it\", he remarked.\n\nHowever, Vitaly Kiselyev, assistant to the head of the \"LNR\", alleged that mall itself was used as an armoury for local territorial defence forces. Similar claims can now be found across social media. Prominent is a pro-Kremlin 'fact-check' shared by a Russian embassy account.\n\nYet as with other claims made by Russia, such as in Bucha and Kramotorsk earlier in the war, these do not appear to be supported by the available open source evidence and videos from the scene.\n\nAs the MOD and foreign minister Lavrov's statements show, Russia does not dispute that the mall was impacted and it admits to carrying out a strike in Kremenchuk.\n\nFootage on social media clearly shows the shopping centre ablaze.\n\nLater imagery shows it completely burned out with the roof entirely caved in.\n\nYet the Russian MOD's comments state that the mall was only impacted as a result of the detonation of ammunition which it claimed was stored nearby at the Kremenchug road machinery plant.\n\nSatellite imagery, as well as open source footage videos posted online, appear to contradict those statements.\n\nA selection of CCTV video from the Mis'ky park, which is north of the factory and mall, shows two moments of impact.\n\nA freeze-frame from one camera looking south towards the factory shows a plume of smoke (red arrow) in the direction of the Amstor mall.\n\nA few seconds later, a second strike appears to land much closer to the camera with flames clearly visible and reflected on the water.\n\nSatellite imagery confirms the areas that were hit by these missiles.\n\nThe below image comparison from the Sentinel-2 L1C satellites shows a comparison of the area around the factory and the mall before (the most recent clear imagery was from May 4) and after the strike.\n\nThe roof of the shopping centre is flattened in the later image while there also seems to have been an impact at the edge of the industrial facility.\n\nThere appears to be little noticeable damage to the area in between the two strikes.\n\nThis is confirmed by Planet satellite imagery.\n\nSeveral buildings between the mall and the site of the second impact appear undamaged. The distance between these two points is approximately one kilometre.\n\nA video shared by an advisor to the Ukrainian presidency late on June 28 appears to show the missile approaching the location of the mall and exploding on impact.\n\nThis, aligned with the fact that the mall appears to have taken a direct hit given there is no clear or significant impact site anywhere in the area around it, would seemingly undermine Russian MOD claims that a fire spread from the factory area.\n\nMoreover, the fact that multiple explosions could not be observed after the initial impact likely suggests that, in contrast to 'LNR' politician Vasilyev's claim, munitions were not kept at the Amstor building.\n\nA freeze frame of the video even appears to provide a view of the type of missile used.\n\nExactly what was hit within the plant by the second missile is also not entirely clear from open source evidence alone.\n\nA series of smaller buildings visible in YouTube videos appear to populate the area that is detailed as being damaged in satellite imagery.\n\nThe building highlighted in the red square above also appears to have been damaged, as the GIF below shows.\n\nAlthough one report in 2014 stated that the factory had been used to repair three military vehicles, this in itself does not prove that it was a storage site for US and European weapons and ammunition eight years later, as Russia has claimed. Vehicles being repaired at the facility would appear to tally up with it being a road machinery plant. Corporate videos taken in recent years show equipment in the plant such as furnaces, cranes and other machinery. It is not possible to verify Russian claims of the plant being an ammo dump from open sources alone.\n\nThe area of the factory that was hit is detailed as being the \"workshop of the plant and greenhouse\" in one regional media report. This is corroborated by one video posted to Facebook by a local, which showed a huge crater at the site of the strike.\n\nOfficial Russian accounts also shared claims that a train yard nearby had also been hit.\n\nHowever, Planet Skysat imagery from June 28, taken at 08:51 UTC, shows no sign of any damage to nearby the Kremenchuk train yard located to the east of the Amstor mall.\n\nSome debris from the strike that hit the mall would likely have impacted a rail line that ran past back of the mall itself.\n\nHowever, this was not close to where a diagram shared by Russian state accounts, produced by the pro-Kremlin 'War on Fakes' project, indicated that it had hit the train yard.\n\nRussia also claimed in its reaction to the strike that the mall was not in use.\n\nThis claim was echoed by the likes of pro-Kremlin news site LifeNews. It stated that a lack of recent reviews on Google for any other websites over recent months, and a lack of images from inside the mall, showed that it was closed at the time of the strikes.\n\nYet these claims omit key details to the contrary.\n\nA blog post from the Comfy retail chain from June 25 listed its outlet at Halamenyuk Street 7 in Kremenchuk in a list of shops which had reopened - this is the address of the Amstor shopping mall.\n\nA local Telegram channel shared a screenshot of messages on June 23 from what appears to be a closed Telegram chat group for Amstor employees stating that the shops would continue to work from 8AM to 9PM as usual, despite air-raid sirens.\n\nSome people posted receipts of transactions undertaken at the mall in recent days to show it was indeed open.\n\nThen there were posts by stores which stated they had been in operation when the strike happened. Some offered their best wishes to staff who had been impacted.\n\nA post on the Toy House Facebook page on June 28 offered condolences to staff that worked on site and were injured.\n\nAnother business based at the mall, Zerna, posted an Instagram story about the fate of a 19-year-old barista who had been badly burnt in the blaze. The coffee shop's account shared her mother's plea for help, in order to cover medical costs.\n\nThe BBC Reality Check team detailed how local Telegram groups had been highlighting that multiple people at the mall were missing in the hours after the attack.\n\nIt also pointed to a YouTube video that had purportedly been recorded the day before the attack and showed the mall open. It was posted on June 27.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpDrt56hPX0&t=771s&ab_channel=FamilyLapkinLife\n\nThe pro-Kremlin news website Regnum, as well as the aforementioned 'fact check' shared by the Russian Embassy also sought to prove that the mall was closed at the time of the attack - and Zelensky's claim of 1,000 civilians present - due to the small number of vehicles at the car park.\n\nHowever, satellite imagery of the mall going back to 2016 shows that, there were many occasions during daylight hours when its car park was sparsely occupied.\n\nThese claims also do not account for the possibility of visitors arriving by public transport. Mapping services show bus, trolleybus and minibus stops in walking distance.\n\nPro-Kremlin media outlet EurasiaDaily, like the aforementioned 'fact check', claimed that only men of military age could be seen at the scene of the explosion. This is also inconsistent with the available open source evidence, in which several women were present after the attack.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of some men in military fatigues is not out of keeping with the aftermath of other attacks across Ukraine on civilian infrastructure behind frontlines, in which members of the territorial defence forces have been seen alongside firefighters, medics and policemen.\n\nThe aforementioned Regnum article also stated that \"there is information that equipment repaired at the nearby Kremenchuk road machinery plant was kept on the territory of the shopping centre\".\n\nAlongside the 'LNR' politician Vasilyev's assertions, the Regnum and EurasiaDaily reports further illustrate a key trend in pro-Russian claims about the strike on Amstor -- that the shopping centre was itself a military facility.\n\nNone of these sources provided any evidence for this claim, nor has any open source information surfaced which might lend credence to it.\n\nThe Russian account of these events presented so far does not tally with the available open source evidence; neither have the Russian authorities provided any verifiable information which could substantiate their claims.\n\nIn contrast to claims by the MoD, the open source evidence indicates that the Amstor shopping centre was not destroyed by an explosion erupting from the nearby industrial area. Instead, video footage appeared to show a missile landed directly on the building - a central shopping centre serving a city of 219,000.\n\nAt the time of publication, dozens are reported to remain missing.", "source": {"uri": "bellingcat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bellingcat"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2022/06/2022-06-28T083611Z_1978898385_MT1EYEIM250192_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-MALL-HIT-BY-RUSSIA-MISSILES.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 38, "stanza_neu": 36, "stanza_pos": 5, "swn_neg": 79, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7096452688", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-29", "time": "15:35:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-29T15:35:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-29T15:34:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4941176474094391, "url": "https://uk.news.yahoo.com/could-children-search-continues-amid-154645654.html", "title": "'There could be children': search continues amid Kremenchuk rubble", "body": "Twenty-four hours after two Russian X-22 cruise missiles hit a crowded shopping centre in Kremenchuk, small plumes of black smoke could still be seen rising from the smoking ruins. Dozens of people who feared their loved ones had been inside the building when the deadly explosions ripped through it looked on in grim silence as a giant crane removed sections of the collapsed roof, exposing blackened debris and twisted metal underneath.\n\nAway from onlookers, rescue workers had placed a stretcher where they carefully placed fragments of charred human remains found in the rubble.\n\nAuthorities estimate there were between 200 and 1,000 people inside at the time of the attack. Many managed to flee to a nearby bomb shelter when they heard the air raid sirens. Others did not make it in time and remained trapped inside. At least 18 people were killed and 21 are still missing.\n\nWhen the missile struck, at 3.53pm local time (1353 BST) on Monday, it ignited a huge fire that took 300 emergency workers more than four hours to extinguish.\n\nMykola Lukash, from the Kremenchuk district prosecutor's office, said members of his team had recovered dozens of body fragments.\n\n\"We need to carry out DNA tests to identify them,\" Lukash said. \"What concerns us are the 21 missing persons reports which had been submitted by locals searching for loved ones who had gone missing in the building.\"\n\nFor more than 20 hours military personnel, volunteers, firefighters and police have been working non-stop to recover bodies from the rubble in the hope of finding survivors.\n\n\"We pulled out several bodies but there are definitely more trapped under the rubble,\" said Oleksii, 46, a firefighter. \"This is normally a very crowded place.\"\n\nEvery day, hundreds of people head to the mall in Kremenchuk to do their shopping or have a coffee and a chat with friends. The only difference between this and any other shopping centre around the world is that here an unpredictable war is raging, one capable of destroying lives in a matter of seconds, even in a place hundreds of miles from the frontline or in cities that have never been bombed before. The truth is that nowhere in Ukraine is safe from Russian missiles or air raids.\n\n\"I left the building two minutes before the explosion,\" said Yevhenia Semyonova, 38, a shop assistant at a sportswear outlet inside the mall. \"My colleagues who are working in bigger stores, like the supermarket for example, had to wait for the customers to get out before they could leave. We were lucky because there were no customers in our store during the alarm.\n\n\"At the beginning of the war, all the shops stopped working during air sirens. But eventually people got used to it and started ignoring the sirens. Unfortunately that's what happened yesterday too. A lot of people I know and some friends are still missing.\"\n\nThe Guardian has seen a phone message allegedly sent by the local management of the mall on 23 June, urging employees not to leave the shopping centre when air raid sirens go off.\n\n\"Starting from today, this shopping centre will not close during the air alarms,\" reads the message. \"The shopping centre works from 8am till 9pm. No breaks.\"\n\nAt least five employees confirmed they had received the message.\n\nA woman who worked in the supermarket inside the mall said she managed to escape immediately after the explosion.\n\n\"Usually on Mondays I was forced to take my little daughter to work because the kindergarten was closed. But luckily yesterday I found someone to take care of her while I was working. Some of my colleagues didn't make it. Someone will certainly still be there, under the rubble.\"\n\nOleksandra, who worked in a jewellery shop, was supposed to open her store today at 10am. \"I had a day off yesterday,\" she said, tears streaming down her face as she surveyed the rubble. \"I had coffee with my colleagues here yesterday morning. There are some people I know who are missing. There was a huge toy store inside the mall. There could be children.\"\n\nAs night fell in Kremenchuk on Monday, the burned-out building was illuminated by floodlights as emergency workers and soldiers combed through the rubble, and relatives of those missing waited across the street.\n\n\"The relatives are confused and anxious,\" said Yulia Fesieieva, a senior psychologist of Poltava regional state emergency service. \"We observe and single out people who are visibly in distress. We approach them and introduce ourselves and try to help them. I've spoken to about 20 people so far.\"\n\nShe continued: \"There was a young man who was shaking, holding his dog in his arms. He was extremely nervous and in shock. He was trying to call his wife who had left the house with her best friend to buy food for their pet but she didn't pick up. In the end, fortunately, his wife left the building 10 minutes before the attack. But her best friend, unfortunately, decided to stay behind and continue shopping. She wasn't able to leave the building before the explosion and died in an intensive care unit.\"\n\nThe attack came on the day of a G7 meeting in Germany where leaders discussed ways to punish Moscow for its invasion and pledged to stand with Ukraine \"for as long as it takes\".\n\nUkraine's air force command said in a statement that Russia hit the mall, which is located near a railway station, with two X-22 cruise missiles that were fired from Tu-22M long-range bombers. According to Kyiv, the planes fired their rockets while in the sky over the Kursk region of Russia, near the Ukrainian border.\n\nCommenting on the strike in his nightly video address, Volodymyr Zelenskiy called Russia \"the largest terrorist organisation in the world\".\n\nOn Monday, Russia's ministry of defence claimed the fire in the shopping mall in Kremenchuk was caused by \"the detonation of stored ammunition for western weapons\". No evidence was offered to back up the claim.\n\nOutside the mall, Ukrainian police set up a table where they placed twisted bits of metal believed to be from the missiles.\n\nVolodymyr Vasylenko, 61, who was born and raised in Kremunchuk, arrived on Tuesday morning at the site of the attack to leave some flowers among the rubble. \"I don't know how and why we deserve this,\" he said. \"They want us to live in fear. But we must not be afraid. We can just continue to pray. Maybe this was God's plan so we could finally get the weapons we needed. In the meantime, there is nothing we can do but to continue doing what one can do.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "image":

The committee had said last week that there would be no more hearings until July.\n\nThe subject of the hearing is so far unclear, but the panel's announcement on Monday said it would be \"to present recently obtained evidence and receive witness testimony.\" A spokesman for the panel declined to elaborate.\n\nThe committee's investigation has been ongoing during the hearings, which started three weeks ago, and the nine-member panel has continued to probe the attack by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. Among other investigative evidence, the committee recently obtained new footage of Trump and his inner circle taken both before and after Jan. 6 from British filmmaker Alex Holder.\n\nHolder said last week that he had complied with a congressional subpoena to turn over all the footage he shot in the final weeks of Trump's 2020 reelection campaign, including exclusive interviews with Trump, his children and then-Vice President Mike Pence. The footage includes material from before the insurrection and afterward.\n\nPost-Roe: Dems challenge GOP to show they care for mothers\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade's constitutional protections for abortion rights set off a contest between Democrats and Republicans going into the midterm elections over whose policies would do more to help vulnerable mothers and children.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who heads the Republican campaign committee in the Senate, said GOP lawmakers now have the responsibility to \"do everything in our power to meet the needs of struggling women and their families so they can choose life.\"\n\nIt's a recognition that, even with a focus on inflation and high gas prices that have vexed President Joe Biden and Democrats, the culturally sensitive issue could complicate the expectations of a GOP takeover of Congress.\n\nThe fallout from Friday's ruling could add to the uncertainty in political races because abortion is also an economic issue for many people. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last month said a repeal \"would have very damaging effects on the economy and would set women back decades.\"\n\nDemocrats suggest their rivals are eleventh-hour converts who would offer half-measures at best and voters should judge them accordingly.\n\nElection 2022: Abortion central in first post-Roe primaries\n\nDENVER (AP) -- The midterm primary season enters a new, more volatile phase on Tuesday as voters participate in the first elections since the U.S. Supreme Court's decision revoking a woman's constitutional right to an abortion jolted the nation's politics.\n\nIn Colorado's Republican U.S. Senate primary, voters are choosing between businessman Joe O'Dea and state Rep. Ron Hanks. O'Dea is the rare Republican who supports most abortion rights while Hanks backs a ban on the procedure in all cases.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Republican race for governor in Illinois, Darren Bailey, a farmer endorsed by former President Donald Trump over the weekend, wants to end the state's right to abortion except for instances in which the mother's life is in danger. He doesn't support exceptions for rape or incest. His opponent, Richard Irvin, the first Black mayor of Aurora, has said he would allow abortions in instances of rape, incest or when the mother's life is at risk.\n\nBoth races are unfolding in states where abortion remains legal. Democrats have sought to elevate both Hanks and Bailey, betting that they have a better chance of winning the fall campaign if they're competing against Republicans they could portray as extreme. In Colorado, Democrats have spent more than $2 million boosting Hanks' candidacy. In Illinois, the sums have been vastly higher, with Democrats spending at least $16 million against Irvin and to boost Bailey as the nominee against Gov. J.B. Pritzker.\n\nThe strategy carries risks, especially if the magnitude of the GOP's expected gains this fall becomes so significant that Democrats lose in states like Illinois and Colorado, which have become strongholds for the party. But at a moment when Democrats are confronting voter frustration over inflation and rising gas prices, the focus on abortion may be their best hope.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell to be sentenced in Epstein sex abuse case\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Ghislaine Maxwell, the jet-setting socialite who once consorted with royals, presidents and billionaires, is set to be sentenced Tuesday for helping the wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse underage girls.\n\nThe 11 a.m. sentencing in New York is the culmination of a prosecution that detailed how the power couple flaunted their riches and prominent connections to lure vulnerable girls as young as 14, and then exploit them.\n\nProsecutors said Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial, sexually abused children hundreds of times over more than a decade, and couldn't have done so without the help of Maxwell, his longtime companion and onetime girlfriend.\n\n\"Maxwell's conduct was shockingly predatory. She was a calculating, sophisticated, and dangerous criminal who preyed on vulnerable young girls and groomed them for sexual abuse,\" prosecutors wrote in a court filing.\n\nIn December, a jury convicted Maxwell of sex trafficking, transporting a minor to participate in illegal sex acts and two conspiracy charges. Prosecutors say she deserves 30 to 55 years in prison.\n\nHong Kong burnishes China ties as luster as global hub fades\n\nHONG KONG (AP) -- Every few generations, Hong Kong transforms itself, evolving from a swampy fishing village to 19th century colonial port, to capitalist outpost and factory after China's 1949 revolution, to 21st century financial center.\n\nAs the former British colony marks the 25th anniversary of its return to China, reeling from pandemic curbs that devastated business and a crackdown on its pro-democracy movement, Hong Kong leaders say it is time to transform again. They say the city should become a leader in technology that relies more on its ties with nearby Chinese factory cities than on global trade.\n\nChief Executive-elect John Lee's government is under pressure to generate new sources of economic growth, looking beyond COVID outbreaks and anti-virus controls that have devastated tourism and business and uncertainty about the legal climate after a crackdown on the city's pro-democracy movement.\n\nIn April, during his election campaign, Lee promised to \"start a new chapter\" for the city better known as one of Asia's busiest ports and biggest stock markets and \"strengthen its competitiveness\" in technology and innovation as well as trade and finance.\n\nLee gave no details but pointed to the Greater Bay Area, a Chinese government initiative to link Hong Kong with neighboring mainland cities including the technology and finance hub of Shenzhen and the manufacturing powerhouses of Dongguan and Foshan.\n\nAP PHOTOS: The iPhone at 15, through pro photographers' eyes\n\nThis week marks 15 years since the iPhone first went on sale and ushered in a new era: the age of the smartphone.\n\nIt's hard to imagine today how different mobile access was before that evening of June 29, 2007. The internet in your pocket didn't look like, well, the internet. Social media -- and the ability for everyone to respond globally to everything -- was in its infancy. And while older phones certainly had cameras, the quality - and the potential for instant editing and filtering and sharing that exists today -- wasn't there yet.\n\nThe modern smartphone has changed photography. To capture a snapshot of that change, we asked more than a dozen Associated Press photographers across the world who use iPhones -- some of the most talented journalists in the business -- to capture an image on their phone and submit it.\n\nHere is what they came up with.

I took a few days to continue to recuperate from my sinus infection and I wanted to give everyone the weekend to process and work through the events of the end of last week, so that's where I've been.\n\nI'm going to ease back into things tonight and just cover the basics including the attack on the shopping center today.\n\nLet's start with President Zelenskyy's address from earlier this evening. Video below with English language transcript after the jump: (emphasis mine)\n\nThis address is without greetings.\n\nToday's Russian strike at a shopping mall in Kremenchuk is one of the most defiant terrorist attacks in European history. A peaceful city, an ordinary shopping mall with women, children, ordinary civilians inside... Before the air alarm there were about a thousand people. Fortunately, as far as we know at this time, many people managed to get out in time. They were taken out in time. But there were still people inside: staff, some visitors...\n\nOnly totally insane terrorists, who should have no place on earth, can strike missiles at such an object. And this is not an off-target missile strike, this is a calculated Russian strike - exactly at this shopping mall.\n\nIt is not yet possible to establish the number of victims for now. A fire broke out in an area of more than 10 thousand square meters. The rescue operation continues, but we must be aware that the losses may be significant. As of now, we know about 12 dead and 24 wounded. We are establishing the number of people under the rubble.\n\nAll the wounded will be provided with all the necessary assistance - Kyiv doctors have already left for Kremenchuk. The Minister of Internal Affairs is already there, he will coordinate all the necessary actions.\n\nMy condolences to the families and friends of those killed in this terrible terrorist attack.\n\nAnd I ask each and every one - whenever you hear the air alarm siren, go to the shelter. Necessarily. Don't ignore it. Russia will stop at nothing.\n\nThis morning, I appealed to the United States to recognize Russia as a state that sponsors terrorism. The relevant resolution is approved by the US Senate Committee, and the legal decision can be adopted by the Department of State. And such a decision is clearly needed, and it must be supported by the entire democratic world. I told this to the participants of the G7 Summit, which took place in Germany.\n\nAs of today, Russia has used almost 2,800 different cruise missiles against Ukraine. The number of air bombs and MLRS rockets hitting our cities simply cannot be counted. There were hundreds of thousands of them in the four months of the war. This is nothing but terror.\n\nAnother brutal shelling of Kharkiv, northern Saltivka took place today. At present, we know about 5 people killed and more than 30 wounded, 5 of them children. All are civilians, no military.\n\nThe Russian state has become the largest terrorist organization in the world. And this is a fact. And this must be a legal fact. And everyone in the world must know that buying or transporting Russian oil, maintaining contacts with Russian banks, paying taxes and customs duties to the Russian state means giving money to terrorists.\n\nI also said today, addressing the leaders of the G7, that our common potential is absolutely enough to defeat the Russian army - it does not know how to fight. All the operations we carry out to deoccupy our territories show one thing: the occupiers are crumbling when we have something to put pressure on them. They do not know how to resist. They are capable only of such vile strikes as those in Kremenchuk or Saltivka today, only of the total thoughtless destruction of all living things as in Mariupol. Therefore, the war may not drag on, if we can really push together and drive the occupiers out of our Ukrainian land. The sooner this happens, the more lives will be saved.\n\nEven before the start of a full-scale war, we told our partners that we needed modern missile defense. We repeated this after February 24 as well. People in the Kremenchuk shopping mall deserved security just as much as people in any mall in the world - somewhere in Philadelphia or Tel Aviv, or in a shopping gallery somewhere in Dresden. The world can, and therefore must, stop Russian terror. And now I can already say this - I heard it from our partners: Ukraine must get reliable missile defense, we are expecting the supply of appropriate systems.\n\nAnd there is another important result of the \"seven\", which is worth mentioning right now. This has already been officially agreed: the most powerful democracies in the world will support our state as long as necessary for our victory.\n\nUkraine will not be broken! Never.\n\nGlory to Ukraine!\n\nHere's today's operational update from Ukraine's MOD: (emphasis mine)\n\nThe operational update regarding the russian invasion on 18.00 on June 27, 2022\n\nThe one hundred twenty fourth (124) day of the heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people to a russian military invasion continues.\n\nrussian occupiers continue to launch missile strikes on civilian targets in Ukraine. Today, in Kremenchuh, Poltava oblast, russian rocket hit a shopping center where civilians were staying. The number of victims is currently unknown. Rescue operations are underway.\n\nDemonstrative and provocative actions by units of the Armed Forces of the republic of belarus in the areas bordering Ukraine are not ruled out in the Volyn and Polissya areas, as well as intensification of intelligence to clarify the positions and nature of our troops.\n\nAir and missile strikes from the territory and airspace of the republic of belarus are expected to continue. Once again, we urge you not to ignore air alarm signals.\n\nIn the Siversky direction, units of the Armed Forces of the russian federation continue to be located in the border areas of the Bryansk and Kursk regions in order to restrain the actions of units of the Defense Forces. The enemy fired mortars near Pokrovka and Starykovo, Sumy oblast. The enemy also used jet artillery in the areas of the settlements of Porozok and Verkhnya Pozhnya, Sumy oblast.\n\nIn the Slobozhansky direction, the enemy is defending previously occupied positions, trying to prevent the advance of units of the Defense Forces and their entry to the state border of Ukraine in the north of Kharkiv region. Intelligence is trying to find weaknesses in the defense of our troops.\n\nIn the Kharkiv direction, the enemy, in order to regain lost ground, tried to carry out assault operations in the area of \u00e2\u20ac\"\u00e2\u20ac\"the settlement of Dementievka, had no success, withdrew. Also, Ukrainian soldiers successfully repulsed enemy assaults in the direction of Dovhalivka and Zalyman.\n\nThe occupiers are taking measures to quickly disguise and try to mislead our units, for which they are installing wooden models of tanks on the defensive positions.\n\nIn the Slovyansk direction, the enemy is trying to improve its tactical position and create favorable conditions for the attack on the settlements of Barvinkove and Slovyansk. Continues shelling.\n\nTrying to take control of Mazanivka, the enemy launched an offensive from the area of \u00e2\u20ac\"\u00e2\u20ac\"the village of Dovhenke. It received a strong rebuff from the Ukrainian defenders and withdrew with losses.\n\nIn the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus on attempts to surround the Defense Forces near the city of Lysychansk, trying to blockade the city from the south and southwest. Takes measures to replenish the loss of personnel, weapons and military equipment.\n\nThe enemy did not take active action in the Kramatorsk direction.\n\nMortar and artillery shelling was recorded in the Lysychansk direction in the areas of the settlements of Lysychansk, Verkhnokamyanka and Soledar.\n\nThe enemy led the offensive in the direction of Vovchoyarivka - Verkhnokamyanka, has partial success, is consolidated south of the Lysychansk refinery. To distract the efforts of our troops, he led the offensive in the direction of Pidlisne - Lysychansk, had no success, withdrew.\n\nIn the Bakhmut direction, it fires artillery of various calibers in the areas of the settlements of Berestove, Klynove, Bakhmut, Vershina and Travneve.\n\nOur soldiers successfully stopped the enemy's reconnaissance attempt by fighting in the area of \u00e2\u20ac\"\u00e2\u20ac\"Berestovo and the offensive in the direction of Midna Ruda - Klynove. In both cases, the occupiers withdrew.\n\nThe enemy has partial success in the direction of the Roty - Vershyna, trying to gain a foothold at the intersection of the E-40 highway.\n\nIn the Avdiivka, Kurakhiv, Novopavliv and Zaporizhzhia directions, in order to restrain the actions of our troops and prevent their transfer to other directions, the enemy fired mortars, tanks, barrel artillery and jet artillery at the areas of the settlements of Pisky, Avdiivka, Katerynivka, Chervone and Malynivka. It struck an air strike near Krasnohorivka.\n\nUkrainian soldiers stopped the occupiers' offensive in the direction of Petrivske-Shevchenko and pushed the enemy back.\n\nIn the South Buh direction, the aggressor continued to fire at the positions of our troops with mortars, tanks, barrel artillery and jet artillery along the entire line of contact. It is possible that the enemy will carry out assault operations in certain areas in order to reach the administrative borders of the Kherson region.\n\nIn readiness to launch missile strikes on objects on the territory of Ukraine, the enemy holds two carriers of cruise missiles of the naval base \"Caliber\".\n\nOur units continue to successfully carry out missile and artillery fire missions in certain areas and inflict casualties on the occupiers in close combat.\n\nWe believe in the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Together to victory!\n\nGlory to Ukraine!\n\nA lot to unpack there. The first is that despite all of Russia's efforts - all the probing and the shelling - they're not making much ground. As the DOD Senior Defense Official stated in his background briefing on 24 June: (emphasis mine)\n\nSo first, because it's kind of out there in the news today, I wanted to just give you my quick take on what we're seeing on the battlefield, and then secondly, a few highlights on security assistance.\n\nSo I just want to put into context what we're seeing in Severodonetsk in terms of the Ukrainian Armed Forces\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 managed retrograde from that location. And the context that I want to share is just, when you look at the sweep of the past four months, obviously we've seen Russia having to, you know, completely recalibrate its plans, because its initial plans were overly ambitious and mismanaged, going from their multi-axis attempt that was defeated by the Ukrainians to now, a focus on Eastern Ukraine. And really, the Russians are just eking out inch by inch of territory here.\n\nMore on Sievierodonetsk in a minute or two, but let's focus on this. What the Pentagon is assessing is that the Russians are just not getting very much out of their efforts. They have almost nothing to show for all the men and material that have been chewed up over the past four months.\n\nLiz Sly at The Washington Post has reported that the Russian military is, as we say in the US military, just about out of Schlitz!\n\nThe Russian military will soon exhaust its combat capabilities and be forced to bring its offensive in Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eastern Donbas region to a grinding halt, according to Western intelligence predictions and military experts.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will come a time when the tiny advances Russia is making become unsustainable in light of the costs and they will need a significant pause to regenerate capability,\u00e2\u20ac said a senior Western official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.The assessments come despite continued Russian advances against outgunned Ukrainian forces, including the capture on Friday of the city of Severodonetsk, the biggest urban center taken by Russia in the east since launching the latest Donbas offensive nearly three months ago.\n\nThe assessments come despite continued Russian advances against outgunned Ukrainian forces, including the capture on Friday of the city of Severodonetsk, the biggest urban center taken by Russia in the east since launching the latest Donbas offensive nearly three months ago.\n\nThe Russians are now closing in on the adjacent city of Lysychansk, on the opposite bank of the Donets River. The town\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capture would give Russia almost complete control of the Luhansk oblast, one of two oblasts, or provinces, that make up the Donbas region. Control of Donbas is the publicly declared goal of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special military operation,\u00e2\u20ac although the multifront invasion launched in February made it clear that Moscow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original ambitions were far broader.\n\nCapturing Lysychansk presents a challenge because it stands on higher ground and the Donets River impedes Russian advances from the east. So instead, Russian troops appear intent on encircling the city from the west, pressing southeast from Izyum and northeast from Popasna on the western bank of the river.\n\nAccording to chatter on Russian Telegram channels and Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy defense minister, Anna Malyar, the Russian military is under pressure to bring all of Luhansk under Russian control by Sunday, perhaps explaining the heightened momentum of the past week.\n\nBut the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153creeping\u00e2\u20ac advances are dependent almost entirely on the expenditure of vast quantities of ammunition, notably artillery shells, which are being fired at a rate almost no military in the world would be able to sustain for long, said the senior Western official.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, is continuing to suffer heavy losses of equipment and men, calling into question how much longer it can remain on the attack, the official said.\n\nOfficials refuse to offer a time frame, but British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, citing intelligence assessments, indicated this week that Russia would be able to continue to fight on only for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153next few months.\u00e2\u20ac After that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Russia could come to a point when there is no longer any forward momentum because it has exhausted its resources,\u00e2\u20ac he told the German newspaper S\u00c3\u00bcddeutsche Zeitung in an interview.\n\nRussian commentators are also noting the challenges, emphasizing a chronic shortage of manpower. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Russia does not have enough physical strength in the zone of the special military operation in Ukraine \u00e2\u20ac| taking into account the almost one thousand kilometer (or more) line of confrontation,\u00e2\u20ac wrote Russian military blogger Yuri Kotyenok on his Telegram account. He estimated that Russia would need 500,000 troops to attain its goals, which would only be possible with a large-scale mobilization, a potentially risky and unpopular move that President Vladimir Putin has so far refrained from undertaking.\n\nMuch, much more at the link!\n\nThis does not mean that Ukraine is cruising to an easy victory. Russia is not spent, it still has a lot of artillery and missiles it can launch and bombs that it can drop on Ukraine. And it hasn't even really tried tapping into its huge population to reconstitute its forces. Regardless of whether that would be a good political move for Putin or not.\n\nAs for Sievierodonetsk, as the Senior Defense Official indicated, the Ukrainians spent the past several days undertaking a retreat our of Sievierodonetsk, back across the river, and to their position on the high ground at Lysychansk. My understanding from the reporting is that the Ukrainians had determined they'd achieved their goals of slowing the Russians down, bottling them up, and attriting their forces and equipment in Sievierodonetsk. As such it was no longer worth continuing to fight there and a retreat out of town and across the river was undertaken and accomplished. Here's former NAVDEVGRU Squadron Commander Chuck Pfarrer's latest map and analysis, from yesterday, on the battle for Sievierodonetsk:\n\nAs you can see, as we've been saying over and over, and as confirmed by the SDO on the 24th, there just isn't a lot of movement in the macro sense of the theater of operations.\n\nHere's today's background briefing from the DOD: (emphasis mine)\n\nSTAFF: All right, hey, good morning, everybody. This is (Edited) from Defense Press Ops. I'm glad we're able to do this this morning. It's been a while since we've done one of these.\n\nJust as a reminder, this is a background brief. Your subject matter expert today will be referred to as \"a senior defense official\", and for your informational purposes, that senior defense official is (Edited). He'll give a brief opener, and then we'll go to Q&A.\n\nWe do have a 30-minute cap on the Q&A today, so we'll have to stick with that. I apologize. We may not be able to get to everybody, but we'll move as quickly as we can.\n\nAnd with that, sir, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nSENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Thanks. Well, first of all, good morning to everyone. All right, I'm going to -- this is going to get you all sharpened up, but I'm going to tell you, I've been on the job now for about two weeks, so I hope you'll forgive any of my misunderstandings just up front, but I would tell you that I've been on the Joint Staff before: left here a couple years ago and in between, was serving in a job that had me in Europe for the last three months, deployed as a part of operations forward. So I do feel pretty comfortable talking about what's going on overseas and I look forward to our conversations today.\n\nI think you're all aware it's the hundredth -- 124th day of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine. As you've likely observed on social media, Ukrainians are noting now that they do have HIMARS in their country. I won't go into any particular details this morning, but all indications are that they are employing them very well. We're continuing to work diligently to get the additional four HIMARS in the country that were announced in last week's PDA. And also of note, the second round of HIMARS training should coincide with that, as well, and we expect that to be done here in the near future. And again, I'm happy to talk about that training and other training that we're conducting with our partners and with the Ukrainians.\n\nOver the weekend, I know you're also aware of the Russian-executed 60 missile strikes across the country in Kyiv, Lviv, Chernihiv and Odesa. We're not quite sure about the Russian objectives of the strikes. They certainly could be a protest against the G7, or of the arrival of HIMARS in country. We do know, and I think all of you have reported to some extent the impact of civilian casualties in Kyiv in particular against apartment buildings that were in vicinity of that strike, or the intended location of that strike. Again, not unusual to hear of civilian casualties associated with Russian strikes, sadly.\n\nIn the Donbas, we haven't observed any real additional further movement out of Severodonetsk or through Severodonetsk by the Russians. We have seen Russian gains. Those gains, as many of you have been reporting, in that portion of the battlespace are occurring (inaudible), and I'm happy to talk a little bit about that, but it does not appear that they have encircled Lysychansk, and the Ukrainians are fighting very well, or very hard in -- in that part of the battlespace.\n\nAnd then, as has been mentioned in open source, we're also aware of several reliefs of Russian generals in Ukraine. I'll leave all the particulars of that to the Russian MOD spokesman, but we do continue to see concerns with that leadership or -- and continued morale concerns with Russian forces.\n\nNear Kherson in the south, we're aware of growing indications of resistance against the Russian occupation. Over the last several days we've become aware of assassinations of local Russian officials, and we're also aware that reporting suggests the Ukrainians have been successful in liberating several small towns northwest and west of Kherson, showing that despite tactical success by the Russians, they continue to hold on to what they capture to territory and prevent it from falling into Russian hands.\n\nThe last thing I'd say before I open it up is, you know, we are continuing to work our security assistance and moving heaven and earth to get that assistance forward to the Ukrainians as fast as we can, and I think what you're seeing on the battlefield is that the Ukrainians are making good use of not just our assistance, but systems that they're obtaining from our partners and allies around the world.\n\nSo I will hold there and look forward to your questions.\n\nSTAFF: All right. We'll go ahead. We'll start with Lita, AP.\n\nQ: Morning. Thank you. Thanks, (SDO), for doing this.\n\nI was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about the new medium to long range missile systems, the NASAMS that are going to be going to Ukraine. Like what additional capabilities that will give them and how long it may take to get them, how many? Just how that might impact the battlespace from your view? And one quick other thing just on this sort of broader, you said you weren't sure -- the U.S. isn't sure why there was suddenly Odesa and all the other broader strikes, is there any -- is there any suggestion that there is an effort by Russia to change its focus or would it be just some statements do you think?\n\nThank you.\n\nSENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Let me -- so on the HIMARS, so the -- I think what we're finding, and I don't want to draw a correlation between the HIMARS and the rocket strikes or the missile strikes that we talked about in the second part of your comment there, you know, as I mentioned, we have not received indications that the strikes by the Russians are associated with the entry of the HIMARS or of anything else, quite honestly. And what I couldn't tell you is if that is part of their larger -- you know, their larger portion of the offensive or not. So I don't want to connect it too.\n\nAnd then the question about the air defense systems. I think you probably saw that the national security adviser talked about the air defense system. That's certainly something that we're looking at, is the way to help Ukrainians with additional air defense assets. I don't have the particulars associated with the systems. But as soon as we know that and as soon as those are finalized, we will certainly work to provide you with those details and the particulars of the systems that we're employing.\n\nSTAFF: All right. We'll go to Dan Lamothe, Washington Post.\n\nQ: Hey, good morning. Thanks for your time today.\n\nWanted to ask about these strikes, mostly by way of what you think they may be targeting, you know, that the -- what weapons deliveries are obviously getting spread out across the country, there is some sense the depots are being at least targeted. Have you seen anything hit in terms of depots? And do you get the sense that that at least an aim here?\n\nSENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Thanks for your question, Dan.\n\nWell, first of all, I'd say, you know, we -- you know, we are apathetic, if that's the right term in terms of the targeting. What I mean by that is, the Ukrainians are determining the targets that they shoot at. So we have provided the systems to the Ukrainians. They were pretty amazing in their training and have been in all sorts of training that's going on outside the country. And then based on that, they're determining the targets that they need to hit. This is their fight. And they're doing that.\n\nI don't have particulars related to the targets that they've struck, but I know that if they were to employ them, they would employ them like we would in some cases against command-and-control or logistics, large concentrations of troops, that types of thing. But don't have the particulars about how they're targeting in this situation.\n\nQ: I'm sorry, just to be clear, I was asking about whether there is an assessment that the Russians are trying to hit Ukrainian depots.\n\nSENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: That's a whole different question that I answered incomplete, or incorrectly. And I don't have that.\n\nSo, we are seeing that they are trying to hit targets -- as an example, the target that resulted in the civilian casualties over the weekend, that target, those apartments were adjacent to or near a factory that we know constructs munitions for the Ukrainians. So it does give an indication that in that case in particular they were trying to hit a military target. I don't have evidence that they're trying to hit other logistic support areas at this time.\n\nSorry about the mess-up on that, Dan.\n\nQ: No problem. Thanks.\n\nSTAFF: All right, we'll go to David Martin, CBS.\n\nQ: Could you give your latest assessment on the two opposing sides' ability to sustain operations? Are the -- you hear absolutely conflicting opinions that the Russians can only keep this up for a couple more months or that the Russians can keep this up forever. What is -- what was the assessment from the Pentagon?\n\nSENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Yes, sure. The -- first of all I would tell you -- I mean, if you just look on paper -- if you just look on paper, the Russians certainly have an advantage that relates to munitions systems and likely total numbers of troops that they can put on the field.\n\nWhat's much harder to gain an understanding of is the will of the Ukrainian fighter. And I think, you know, and I know you all have reported on this extensively as well, but if you go back to the very beginnings the Ukrainian fighter has demonstrated an ability to win in a level of adversity that is just surprising in many cases.\n\nWith that in mind, I'd be hazard to give you any kind of timetable associated with either sides' ability to press, and just because I think it has surprised the world time and time again.\n\nI do know this: The Russians can stop any time they want. The Russians are the ones that instigated this. The Russians are the one that attacked a sovereign nation. And so, at any time they could opt to stop and head back. I imagine that, you know, that won't necessarily be the exact thing we see, but that's certainly their possibility.\n\nQ: Let me ask you more specifically then with Severodonetsk. Are they going to be able to exploit that or do they now have to stop and regroup?\n\nSENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: That's a great question.\n\nI think -- you know, so they certainly wanted Severodonetsk. What's -- you know, from a military perspective, what I would tell you is the small number of Ukrainians that held the Russians at Severodonetsk for as long as they did is really something I think we'll probably all study in the future.\n\nAnd when they chose to leave Severodonetsk, they chose to do it of their own accord, and to give that up in order to move to better-prepared locations for the continuing of that defense. And so, again, I'm telling you I think we'll end up studying that in our army in years to come. I think they're going to do that throughout that portion of the battlespace or the battlefield.\n\nYou know, if you look at that spot, it's not very big. And what I mean by that is the area that the Russians and the Ukrainians are fighting over right now and that the Russians are losing a large number of people to gain, the Ukrainians are making them pay for a very small piece of ground.\n\nIn most cases, the Ukrainians are leaving those locations of their accord, not necessarily because the Russians have made them do but because they are choosing to move to positions of greater advantage. And the cost is pretty significant for the Russians. I think we'll see that continue.\n\nIt is important, though, when you look at the map to realize the size of that general area is not huge. I think and this is -- I haven't put this on a map, but I think the entire area we're talking about is something like from D.C. to Fairfax for those who live in this area. So not very big.\n\nThe way it's being described in some circles you would think that it was here to Richmond or here to Norfolk, but that's not the case. And again, the Ukrainians are holding that at pretty extensive cost for the Russians.\n\nSTAFF: All right, we'll go to Idrees with Reuters.\n\nQ: Can I just try that question once more? So there was basically a Washington Post story over the weekend citing Western intelligence, saying that Russia would exhaust its combat capabilities and be forced to stop its offensive in the east. Do you have any intel product that says their combat capabilities are near to being exhausted and they'll have to stop their offensive?\n\nSENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: I don't have those particulars to be able to talk to any real knowledge here. I'm sorry.\n\nQ: That works. Thank you.\n\nSTAFF: All right, we'll go to Jack Detsch, F.P.\n\nQ: Sort of on a similar line, U.K. intelligence this morning said that Russia's likely to start leaning more heavily on reserve forces, echelons of reserve forces in the Donbas. Just wondering if you've seen sort of any mobilization of those sorts of forces perhaps from the army combat reserves or from other echelons of Russian forces.\n\nSENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: I know that the Russians have employed reserves over the last month or so. The fact that the Russians are talking about reserves speaks to the impact the Ukrainians are taking on the Russian army. And again, going back to our earlier discussion about, you know, initial indications about how the Russians might perform or the Ukrainians might do so, the fact that there continue to be reports and conversations about Russians using reserve speaks to the impact that the Ukrainians are having against their army.\n\nSTAFF: All right, we'll go to Mike Glenn.\n\nQ: Yes. Thank you (SDO).\n\nWith the high number of combat casualties, there have been some reports that the Russians are really having to scrape the bottom of the barrel for their senior leadership, including calling up retired officers back to the active duty. I'm wondering if can you all confirm that they're really digging for senior leaders because of all the casualties they've suffered.\n\nSENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: You know, I think I've seen some of the same open press you have. I have not seen any particulars in our circles here, but I've seen the same open-source reports.\n\nYou know, given the way and per my earlier comments about general officers being replaced, it would make sense that they will start to run shy of senior leaders. And so, I think there's probably some veracity to those reports. I just don't have any particular evidence myself.\n\nQ: Okay, thanks.\n\nSTAFF: All right, we'll got to Nick, PBS, Nick Schifrin.\n\nQ: Thanks, (SDO). Thank you very much.\n\nCan we go back to Severodonetsk and Lysychansk a little bit? I know you're trying to describe the physical area that it is, but as you know politically Severodonetsk became important because Russian separatists seized the administrative capital of Luhansk and Severodonetsk became Ukrainian-held, essentially, political capital of the Oblast. So can you talk about the significance of the fall of Severodonetsk from a little bit more strategic perspective, and the risk to Lysychansk that is posed today?\n\nAnd then I know Lita asked about NASAMS. I know, even if you don't want to specify the platform, could you just talk about the requests that Ukraine is asking for when it comes air defense? Can you talk about what you understand the air defense requirement is today, and in general, how the U.S. is trying to help that?\n\nThanks.\n\nSENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Sure, Nick. I appreciate the question.\n\nI should probably clarify the criticality of ground. If I'm a Ukrainian, every foot of Ukrainian soil I give up is pretty important to me. And so I don't want to -- I don't want to underestimate the impact of losing ground to the Ukrainians. I think, you know, similarly to Mariupol, I think there was a great deal of symbolism in Severodonetsk for many of the reasons you just stated.\n\nI think it's also important -- and I'm not, you know, wearing a Ukrainian uniform or a member of the Ukrainian government certainly, but I think what you'll be able to see is the Ukrainians kind of rally around the fight that they gave the Russians in Severodonetsk. And so although they gave up ground, I think they did so by extracting a pretty significant cost against the Russians. The fact that, you know, in the end, several hundred Ukrainians continue to hold off the Russian Army in that part of the world in a -- a pretty significant fight. It speaks again to the veracity -- or not the veracity, but the tenacity of the Ukrainian soldier and their leadership.\n\nThe -- back to the air defense question, the Ukrainians have asked for additional air support -- defense support. I know that the Ukrainians are looking for air defense in all sorts of ways, so -- from helicopters and airplanes, as well as missiles. And so we are working with the Ukrainians through all of our sources and with our partners and allies to provide them with the systems that they ask for that get after those needs.\n\nBelieve it or not, there is still a lot more Q&A at the link!\n\nIf you're wondering what bottom of the barrel for Russian senior military leaders looks like, this is it:\n\nThis morning Ukrainian Forces carried out another strike on Russian positions on Snake Island!\n\nUnfortunately, and as you saw referenced in both President Zelenskyy's address and the Ukrainian MOD's update, the Russians launched a cruise missile strike on a shopping mall earlier today.\n\nUkraine said it feared scores of civilians might be dead or injured after\u00c2 a Russian missile strike\u00c2 hit a crowded shopping mall in the center of the country Monday.\n\nMore than 1,000 people were inside at the time of the rocket attack,\u00c2 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u00c2 said.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The number of victims is impossible to imagine,\u00e2\u20ac he added in a\u00c2 post\u00c2 on the Telegram messaging app, sharing video that showed plumes of gray smoke rising above a building that was consumed in flames as people and first responders ran in front of it.\n\nThe apparent attack hit a shopping center in Kremenchuk, a city in the Poltava region on the banks of Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dnieper River. Dmytro Lunin, head of the Poltava region, said at least 13 people were killed and more than 40 others were injured.\n\n\"It is too early to talk about the final number of the killed,\" he said as night fell in Ukraine.\n\nStanding inside the smoking rubble of what was once a supermarket, Anton Herashchenko, an adviser for the Ministry of Internal Affairs, said rescuers were digging through what remained of the roof to find potential survivors.\n\n\"Rescue workers are underway to save people who just came to buy groceries,\" he said, lifting the camera to show dozens of people frantically shoveling and sawing in to the blackened debris.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force Command reported that the missiles were fired from long-range bombers that took off from a Russian air base north of Ukraine.\n\nNBC News has not verified that claim or the number of any deaths. The Russian Embassy in the United States did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Ukrainian claims.\n\nMuch more at the link, including Russia's odious claims that this was a false flag attack carried out by the Ukrainians on their own people as provocation against Russia. Which is, of course, a lie!\\\n\nAnd here, from Patron's official TikTok, is Patron engaged in the most serious fight of any war: fighting to stay awake during a briefing!", "source": {"uri": "balloon-juice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Balloon Juice"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_l_silverman@balloon-juice.com", "name": "Adam L Silverman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 78, "stanza_neu": 229, "stanza_pos": 17, "swn_neg": 324, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093782013", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "16:38:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T16:38:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T16:37:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4823529422283173, "url": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/law-order/2088897-at-least-three-killed-in-russian-missile-strike-on-shopping-mall-ukraine-says", "title": "At least three killed in Russian missile strike on shopping mall, Ukraine says | Law-Order", "body": "Two Russian missiles slammed into a crowded shopping centre in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk on Monday, killing at least three people and wounding 40, senior Ukrainian officials said.

It is believed to have been an X-22 Russian cruise missile fired from a Tu-22M long-range bomber.\n\nSatellite images show the factory is 500 metres from the mall. According to independent military experts and researchers from Molfar, a global open source intelligence community, the explosion there could not have provoked a fire strong enough to reach another building that far away.\n\nDuring a visit to the area between the mall and the factory, little to no damage to buildings or roads was observed, suggesting no spreading fire.\n\nDozens of workers who survived, as well as witnesses who lived nearby, told the Guardian that the mall was open and busy when attacked. Debris included the remains of workers' badges, and products sold that day at the supermarket.\n\nThe Guardian has seen a phone message allegedly sent by the local management of the mall on 23 June urging employees not to leave the shopping centre in case of air raid sirens. \"Starting from today, this shopping centre will not close during the air alarms,\" the message stated. \"The shopping centre is open from 8am till 9pm. No breaks.\" At least five employees confirmed they had received the message.\n\nBellingcat, a non-profit online journalism collective dedicated to war crime investigations, collected receipts from purchases at the mall in recent days that were posted on social media by residents in Kremenchuk to show that the mall was indeed open.\n\nAs for the alleged weapons depot, the KredMash factory, Kremenchuk Road Machinery is a company producing equipment to repair and maintain roads or to repair vehicles used by construction workers.\n\nBellingcat said: \"Although one report in 2014 stated that the factory had been used to repair three military vehicles, this in itself does not prove that it was a storage site for US and European weapons and ammunition eight years later, as Russia has claimed.\"\n\nCorporate videos published on YouTube by specialised construction companies show the presence of cranes and other equipment in the factory, which has corroborated the account of the Ukrainian authorities.\n\nAccording to various accounts collected by the Guardian, the plant had been temporarily closed because of the war.

Lysychansk is the last major area of the province under Ukrainian control following the retreat of Ukraine's forces from the neighboring city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nRussian troops and their separatist allies control 95% of Luhansk and about half of the Donetsk region, the other province that makes up the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Authorities in the city declared three days of mourning.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Services press officer Svitlana Rybalko told The Associated Press that along with the 18 people killed, investigators found fragments of eight more bodies.

Mykolaiv is a major port and seizing it -- as well as Odesa further west -- would be key to Russia's objective of cutting off Ukraine from its Black Sea coast.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said in a statement that the missile strike on Mykolaiv targeted a base for training \"foreign mercenaries,\" as well as ammunition depots.\n\nKyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko on Tuesday urged NATO leaders in Madrid to do whatever it took to stop the war, saying that if Ukraine is defeated, \"you're going to be next.\"\n\nIn other developments:\n\n-- A senior Russian lawmaker has warned that Lithuania's refusal to allow some goods targeted by European Union sanctions through to Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad could trigger a military confrontation.\n\nWednesday's statement by Vladimir Dzhabarov, a deputy head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of Russia's parliament, followed the Kremlin's warning that it will retaliate against restrictions of transit to Kaliningrad. The region borders EU and NATO members Poland and Lithuania.\n\n-- Russia's foreign ministry summoned Norway's charge d'affaires to protest Oslo's blocking of a shipment of supplies to a Russian coal-mining town in the Svalbard islands.\n\nAlthough the Svalbards are Norwegian territory, a 1920 treaty allows all signatory countries the right to exploit its natural resources. Russia operates a coal mine in Barentsburg, a settlement of about 450 people, which relies on shipments from the mainland of food, machinery and other supplies. Norway imposed sanctions on shipments from Russia in April.\n\n-- Ukrainian military intelligence says that in the largest prisoner swap since the start of the war 144 Ukrainian troops were released from Russian captivity. Of those released, 95 were involved in defending the Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's devastated southern city of Mariupol that Russian forces captured weeks ago. There was no word on how many Russian soldiers were freed in return.\n\n-- European Union leaders approved Wednesday a 600-million euro ($631 million) package to address food security issues brought on by the Ukraine war in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.\n\n-- Britain is imposing sanctions on Russia's second-richest man and on a cousin of President Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Potanin, owner of the Interross conglomerate, has continued to amass wealth while backing Putin, acquiring Rosbank and shares in Tinkoff Bankonith in the period following the invasion of Ukraine, a U.K. government statement said Wednesday.\n\nThe statement said Putin's cousin, Anna Tsivileva, and her husband, Sergey Tsivilev, have \"significantly benefited\" from their relationship with Putin. Tsivileva is president of the JSC Kolmar Group coal mining company, and Tsivilev is governor of the coal-rich Kemerovo region.\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

There were hundreds of people inside the centre when Russian missiles hit it on Monday. The number of casualties is still unclear, but there are 20 confirmed deaths and tens of unidentified bodies. The mall was miles away from any military target. There could be no other reason to attack it than to spread fear and terror in Ukraine. The Russian military hit it with two missiles, ensuring devastating damage.\n\nG7 countries unanimously condemned those attacks, as they should. But unless the world puts a meaningful political and legal definition to these atrocities, such condemnations will very quickly be forgotten by the general public. The world needs to comprehend that along with a ruthless military operation Russia conducts indiscriminate attacks on non-military targets: this is terrorist activity. We need to distinguish it and qualify it as such.\n\nMost people think of terrorism as an asymmetric tactic of political coercion pursued by rogue political organisations or insurgent groups against a more powerful adversary. In this case, it is pursued by a major state power against a smaller nation. But the goals and methods are the same.\n\nThis is not the first time in this war that Russia has attacked civilian infrastructure. There were other attacks earlier this week, the most publicised on a block of flats in Kyiv at around 6am. I understand one family has been hit particularly hard, with the father killed and the mother and seven-year-old daughter wounded. A kindergarten was another target on the same day; thankfully it was empty.\n\nThe world was shocked by the shopping centre tragedy, but Russia did not stop. It sent more missiles on Tuesday and Wednesday, hitting the coastal towns of Mykolaiv and Ochakiv with 11 on Tuesday. One struck housing in Ochakiv, wounding six people, including children. A baby is now in a coma. There were three fatalities, including a six-year-old. Rescuers are still sifting through the rubble. Later, Russia fired 11 more missiles at the city of Dnipro, and on Wednesday it hit a tower block in Mykolaiv again, leaving five wounded and three dead.\n\nIt is relentless. These are just examples from the past couple of days. Ukrainian citizens hear air raid alarms daily, and for months we have had horrific missile attacks on civilians in seemingly random cities, towns and villages. Russia's vast stockpiles of missiles are being emptied on to Ukrainian territory on an industrial scale. The staggering number of hits on sites with no strategic or military value leaves us in no doubt as to the true purpose of the strikes.\n\nSome of the targets are well known: the rail station full of refugees in Kramatorsk and tower blocks in Chernihiv, Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa. A school in Kharkiv. A maternity hospital in Mariupol. Many more cases are much less known. The lists of the civilian buildings hit and the tragedies of the people who are affected are updated daily.\n\nHundreds of children's deaths have been confirmed in Ukraine, but within the occupied territories many more deaths remain unknown. As a result, people there are buried in unidentified graves, and often not buried at all.\n\nRussia has not denied that it was behind the strikes in these cases. On the contrary, sometimes it provides hasty explanations, mainly for its domestic audience. In the case of the shopping centre, a defence ministry spokesman claimed that Russia had hit a military target and fire had then spread to an empty shopping mall. Of course, video exists apparently showing the direct hit on the mall.\n\nThese are seemingly random attacks that go alongside the more focused horrors we see in cities such as Mariupol. Five months ago, it was a thriving coastal city of half a million. Since then, Russian planes and missiles have been razing it building by building. An unknown number of people, but certainly tens of thousands, sometimes entire families, were buried under the wreckage.\n\nRussians use these destructive tactics in all their advances in Ukraine. These entail attacking cities from the air, then with multiple rocket launchers and artillery, and then with tanks. Infantry come in only when there is not much left to defend.\n\nJust recently, they took the industrial city of Severodonetsk after destroying most of it. They are doing the same with their next target, Lysychansk. Although these assaults are nominally made as part of a military operation, as with the attacks on the shopping centre and apartment blocks in cities where no combat is taking place, they routinely hit targets with no connection to military infrastructure. The targets do not further any immediate operational objective.\n\nThe definition of terrorism is a deliberate, indiscriminate attack on civilians with a political goal. That is precisely what Russia is doing. With grim cynicism, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov has suggested stopping the strikes immediately if Ukraine capitulates. Of course, Ukraine will not, but that comment once more confirms the Russian regime's complete understanding of its actions and comprehensive control over this madness.\n\nAmazingly, despite their total condemnation of Russia's brutality, democratic countries still do not formally recognise it as a terrorist state or \"state sponsor of terrorism\". Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, has repeatedly asked our allies to do this since March. The only country that responded was Lithuania, which declared Russia a terrorist state on 10 May. Just a few days ago, the US Senate's foreign relations committee advanced a resolution declaring that Russia was a state sponsor of terrorism and recommending the US government formally recognise it as such.\n\nAfter the Kremenchuk tragedy hit the news, Zelenskiy made that appeal again. What, exactly, is the world waiting for?\n\nRecognising Russia as a terrorist state is not just a political statement: it also has substantial legal consequences. No one in the west will do business with terrorists. The respective government and business policies exist in almost every corporate code of conduct or democratic state law. That recognition would help stop Russia from making the financial revenue necessary to keep funding the war. It would significantly undermine the Russian war effort - not soon, but in the long run.\n\nWhat is the point of all previous anti-terrorism efforts and legal and political frameworks if they cannot be used here? Or are there special privileges for high-income terrorist states? Or are some lives not meaningful enough?\n\nI sincerely hope the world will not hesitate much longer.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b142ebfb2b8bdf3a2f1ee05b0faf0a0fafbbbb03/0_249_7360_4414/master/7360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=850df17e4a01a41c5e1001a90214c63f", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 22, "stanza_neu": 47, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 71, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093809350", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "17:03:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T17:03:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T17:03:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.47843137383461, "url": "https://www.usanews.net/breaking/russia-launches-a-missile-on-a-shopping-center-with-a-thousand-people-h25090.html", "title": "Russia launches a missile on a shopping center with a thousand people inside in the center of Ukraine", "body": "The Russian army has launched a missile on a shopping center in Kremenchuk, an industrial city that before the war had just over 200,00 inhabitants before the war, on the banks of the Dnieper.\n\nThe Russian army has launched a missile on a shopping center in Kremenchuk, an industrial city that before the war had just over 200,00 inhabitants before the war, on the banks of the Dnieper.

But if you were watching Russian television that day, you would probably have seen nothing about it.\n\nThe Russian media blackout on the attack, which left at least 18 people dead, according to the Ukrainian government, is part of a playbook on how similar incidents have been handled as the Kremlin tries to present itself as a liberating force that does not harm civilians.\n\nAnd with images of charred bodies emerging in the foreign press, Russian officials began to declare the strike a \"Bucha-like provocation\", disregarding evidence of war crimes amid growing international isolation.\n\nTelevision, the most closely controlled sector of the Russian media, did not mention the strike in the main evening news broadcasts on Monday. Only when the Russian defence ministry confirmed the strike and claimed without evidence that there had been ammunition stored in the shopping centre did most Russian media begin coverage.\n\nThe blackout extended far beyond just state-owned media. Private radio, online and print media also toed the Kremlin line, with tabloids such as the pro-Kremlin Komsomolskaya Pravda and the business daily Kommersant ignoring the strike. Even private newswires such as Interfax did not mention the strike until Tuesday, carefully presenting their pieces as responses from Russian officials calling the attack a fake.\n\nThe response is a part of Russia's evolving wartime propaganda. On the first day of the war, Roskomnadzor, the Russian censor, wrote that media were \"obliged to use information and data they obtain only from official Russian sources\". Since then, local media have either been shut or have learned to take their cues from the Russian military before reporting the news of the day.\n\nChannel One, the country's main television channel, kicked off its Monday evening news broadcast with the story of a Russian soldier receiving an award from the Kremlin. The broadcast then moved on to Russian strikes against Kyiv, parroting claims by the Russian defence ministry that damage to a residential building was caused by Ukraine's own air defence systems rather than a Russian missile.\n\n\"This is the building they're talking about,\" a reporter intoned with derision. \"Western channels have presented it all as though our military hit a civilian building. But the rockets were actually Ukrainian and the building, according to available information, was empty since April.\"\n\nIt was a pattern that repeated itself with the strike in Kremenchuk, with a few Russian pundits preparing the ground to call it a fake even before Moscow commented.\n\n\"We should wait for official comment,\" said Vladimir Soloviev, a popular Russian talkshow host. \"But this site has probably been used by the [Ukrainian] military for a long time.

In an instant, it turned into something horrific.\n\nShe ignored an air-raid siren that sounded as they entered the Amstor mall complex in Kremenchuk, central Ukraine, on Monday afternoon, thinking she would just pop in quickly and find the price. She was talking to a shop assistant when a 2,000-pound Russian missile landed on the mall, not far from where she was standing.\n\n\"And then I remember myself flying,\" Ms. Mykhailets said in an interview Tuesday morning as she lay in a hospital bed in Kremenchuk. \"I was flying headfirst somewhere. My whole body was beaten, all over, and shards were falling on me.\"\n\nBy the time she landed, two pieces of debris had fallen on her and she called out to her husband for help. He had fallen unconscious. Ms. Mykhailets's arm was broken and was dangling to the side.\n\n\"Considering what happened there, we came out well,\" she said. Her mouth and face were covered in scars and stitches. \"We survived.\"\n\nShe was lucky. As emergency workers combed through the rubble of the mall Tuesday morning, the city's mayor said the death toll from the missile strike had risen to 18. He declared three days of mourning.\n\nThe strike was the latest example of Russia's persistence in launching indiscriminate attacks on civilians at nonmilitary targets.\n\nSome 25 people had been hospitalized after the strike and 21 remained missing, Dmytro Lunin, the governor of the Poltava region, said in a news conference Tuesday afternoon. Rescuers were still digging through the rubble, he added, but it would be impossible for anyone else to be found alive.\n\nHundreds had been inside the mall. About 60 people had sought medical help, the mayor, Vitaliy Maletskiy, wrote on Facebook. At the hospital where Ms. Mykhailets was being treated, five people were in critical condition, according to the chief doctor, Oksana Korlyakova.\n\nBetter Understand the Russia-Ukraine WarHistory and Background: Here's what to know about Russia and Ukraine's relationship and the causes of the conflict.How the Battle Is Unfolding: Russian and Ukrainian forces are using a bevy of weapons as a deadly war of attrition grinds on in eastern Ukraine.Russia's Brutal Strategy: An analysis of more than 1,000 photos found that Russia has used hundreds of weapons in Ukraine that are widely banned by international treaties.Outside Pressures: Governments, sports organizations and businesses are taking steps to punish Russia.

Nearby, children's party favors were scattered about. Amstor had the biggest children's play center in Kremenchuk.\n\nNine people died in the Comfy store, the authorities said, because the missile struck close by.\n\n\"The fire spread in a few minutes, almost instantly,\" said Oleksandr Lysenko, deputy head of the Main Directorate of the State Emergency Service in Poltava region, as workers continued to search for the missing. Everything around him in the back of the mall complex was destroyed, except for some packages of bird food from the pet store that had stood there.\n\n\"There was no chance for people to escape.\"\n\nMr. Mykhailets said he was lucky because he regained consciousness after a water pipe exploded above him.\n\n\"I woke up from the fact that water was dripping on me,\" he said from his hospital bed. His head and legs were bandaged. \"It was broken pipes. If it wasn't for the water, I might have burned alive. I remember lying there and feeling like, 'Oh yes, pour on me.'\"\n\nHe crawled out from under the rubble and worked to free his wife from the slab.\n\n\"There was so much smoke and fire,\" he said. \"People were crying, yelling, running. Some just laid under the slabs. I saw some head and hands sticking out from underneath.\"\n\nUkraine's top prosecutor, Irina Venediktova, arrived on the scene on Tuesday with a team of investigators to collect evidence about the attack, which she said constituted a \"war crime\" under Ukrainian law.\n\nLive Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated June 28, 2022, 9:31 a.m. ETRussia strikes fresh civilian targets one day after attacking a shopping mall, killing eight civilians.Ukraine says it arrested a man suspected of helping target a deadly attack, accusing him of treason.'This is our 1937 moment,' the U.K.'s new army chief says of the war.\n\nThe prosecutor denounced what she described as the \"systematic shelling of civilian infrastructure: hospitals, kindergartens, malls as you see here.\"\n\n\"I am sure the Russians know very well that they are killing civilians,\" Ms. Venediktova added. \"For them it is not news, but they do it again and again.\"\n\nRussia's defense ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that it had struck Kremenchuk with what it described as \"high-precision missiles.\" But it said that its target had been depots containing munitions for weapons systems supplied by the United States and European countries, and that a munitions explosion had set the mall ablaze.\n\nThe claims could not be independently verified, and Ukraine's interior minister said at a briefing for journalists that \"there is no military object in a five-kilometer radius.\"\n\nA second missile hit an industrial facility behind the mall that produced materials for road repair, according to the Ukrainian authorities, who said the factory had not served any military purpose.\n\nA woman who worked at the factory said the same.\n\n\"Almost nothing was happening there,\" the woman, Margarita Svyatobog, 58, said when interviewed nearby. She had been waiting for the war to end so she could go back to work.\n\n\"I worked at that factory for almost my whole life, and now I will be left without work,\" she added, tearing up.\n\nThe authorities said the weapons that hit both the factory and the mall were old Soviet X-22 missiles weighing about 2,000 pounds.\n\nIn a small park next to the shopping center, a makeshift memorial had been set up of 16 vases filled with flowers -- one for each of the 16 casualties initially announced Monday night. Somber visitors lit candles for the dead.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine claimed in an evening video address that the strike was intentional. \"This is not an accidental hit -- this is a calculated Russian strike,\" he said.\n\nThis was the sixth and most deadly Russian missile strike on Kremenchuk, an industrial city that had a prewar population of 217,000. Although some residents have left, many displaced people have arrived from other cities that have faced heavy bombardment, such as Kharkiv and Mariupol.\n\nAmong the wounded in Monday's strike was Yulia, 22, who had fled to Kremenchuk from Kharkiv with her mother. They previously lived in Luhansk, a city that was occupied by Moscow-backed separatists in 2014.\n\nYulia and her mother, Larisa, had fled to Kharkiv in the early part of the war, and then two months ago fled again to Kremenchuk because of heavy shelling in Kharkiv. Yulia had found a job selling mobile phones in the shopping center.\n\n\"We hoped we would be safe here,\" said Larisa, who like her daughter did not feel comfortable sharing her last name. \"This is a deep trauma for my soul.\"\n\nIn the hours after the strike, pro-Moscow news outlets and social media channels were quick to dismiss the attack as staged by the Ukrainians.\n\n\"I want the world to know that this is not fake,\" Larisa said, speaking while visiting her daughter at the hospital. \"People suffered, and it is very scary.\"\n\nMr. Mykhailets, a white bandage wrapped around his head, his face, arms, and legs scarred and wounded, was still trying to make sense of what had happened.\n\n\"I understand the reasons to hit infrastructure, to break the power plants and gas stations,\" he said. \"But to hit the mall is absurd. There were a lot of children there. Near Comfy there is a children's play place. The strike hit right there.\"\n\nOleksandr Chubko contributed reporting from Kyiv, and Ivan Nechepurenko from Tblisi, Georgia.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/28/world/28Ukraine-mall1/28Ukraine-mall1-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 30, "stanza_neu": 56, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 87, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094827765", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "12:27:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T12:27:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T12:23:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4745098054409027, "url": "https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/dozens-still-missing-after-russian-missile-strike-on-mall-kills-18", "title": "Dozens still missing after Russian missile strike on mall kills 18", "body": "KREMENCHUK -- Exhausted firefighters searched on Tuesday for survivors in the rubble of a Ukrainian shopping mall, where authorities said 36 people were still missing after a Russian missile strike that killed at least 18.\n\nThe attack, in the central city of Kremenchuk far from any frontline, drew a wave of global condemnation.\n\nUkraine said Moscow had killed civilians deliberately.

Lysychansk is the last major area of the province under Ukrainian control following the retreat of Ukraine's fighters from the neighboring city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nRussian troops and their separatist allies control 95% of Luhansk and hold about half of Donetsk region, the other province that makes up the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Authorities in the city declared three days of mourning.\n\nThe blast from Tuesday's airstrike was so powerful, relatives may not be able to recover any trace of their loved ones' remains.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Services press officer Svitlana Rybalko told The Associated Press that along with the 18 people killed, investigators found fragments of eight more bodies. A number of survivors were being treated for injuries such as skull fractures and severed limbs.\n\n\"The police cannot say for sure how many (victims) there are. So we are finding not the bodies but the fragments of bodies,\" Rybalko said. \"Now we are clearing at the very epicenter of the blast. Here, we practically cannot find bodies as such.\"\n\nSeveral families stood by what was left of the Amstor shopping center Wednesday morning in hopes of finding missing loved ones. One young woman sat cross-legged on the ground weeping behind dark sunglasses,.\n\n\"This is pure genocide,\" local resident Tatiana Chernyshova said while going to lay flowers at the site. \"Such things cannot happen in the 21st century. Peaceful people suffer.\"\n\n\"We need to engage everyone to help stop the war, help us fight these scum - these Russian aggressors,\" Chernyshova said. \"It needs to be stopped by any means possible.\"\n\nPsychologists working at the site with families told the AP they were trying to help people come to terms with their loss.\n\n\"We are trying to help them release their emotions now, as later it becomes harder and much more painful,\" said one psychologist, who did not give his name as he was not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nAfter the attack on the mall, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of becoming \"a terrorist\" state carrying out \"daily terrorist acts.\" On Wednesday, he reproached NATO for not embracing or equipping his embattled country more fully.\n\n\"The open-door policy of NATO shouldn't resemble old turnstiles on Kyiv's subway, which stay open but close when you approach them until you pay,\" Zelenskyy told NATO leaders meeting in Madrid, speaking by video link. \"Hasn't Ukraine paid enough? Hasn't our contribution to defending Europe and the entire civilization been sufficient?\"\n\nHe asked for more modern artillery systems and other weapons and warned the leaders they either had to provide Ukraine with the help it needed to defeat Russia or \"face a delayed war between Russia and yourself.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Wednesday dismissed what she claimed was the Ukrainian government's \"blatant provocation\" in trying to blame the mall missile strike on Russia's military.\n\n\"All these fakes, unfortunately, were replicated and distributed,\" Zakharova said.\n\nBritain's Defense Ministry said there was a \"realistic possibility\" the missile strike on the shopping center \"was intended to hit a nearby infrastructure target.\"\n\n\"Russian planners highly likely remain willing to accept a high level of collateral damage when they perceive military necessity in striking a target,\" the ministry said. \"It is almost certain that Russian will continue to conduct strikes in an effort to interdict the resupplying of Ukrainian front-line forces.\"\n\nRussia's military also is experiencing a shortage of \"more modern precision strike weapons\" that together with \"the professional shortcomings of their targeting planners\" is compounding civilian casualties, the British ministry said.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, a Russian missile strike in the city of Mykolaiv killed at least four people and injured five after a missile hit a multi-story apartment building Wednesday, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said.\n\nMykolaiv is a major port in Ukraine's south and seizing it - as well as Odesa further west - would be key to Russia's objection of cutting off Ukraine from its Black Sea coast.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said in a statement that the missile strike on Mykolaiv targeted a base for training \"foreign mercenaries,\" as well as ammunition depots.\n\nRussian forces have been regularly pummeling Ukrainian weapons and munitions depots, oil storages and other facilities across Ukraine.\n\nVitali Klitschko, the mayor of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, urged the NATO leaders in Madrid to do whatever it took to stop the war, saying that if Ukraine is defeated, \"you're going to be next.\"\n\n\"If it's not going to be stopped now, all of us are going to be affected. The free world, the so-called free world is going to be affected. And NATO and the world society needs to learn how to act fast,\" Klitschko said.\n\nSeparately, European Union leaders approved Wednesday a 600 million euro package to address food security issues brought on by the Ukraine war. The money, from European Development Fund reserves, will be earmarked for African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

Each bucket represented one of the dead recovered from the mall after a Russian missile strike Monday, a number that has since risen to 18.\n\nMs. Volya said she still didn't know the fate of the friendly, pregnant young woman who worked at the mall's lingerie kiosk. They chatted often, but she didn't know her name.\n\nShe now fears that the conversation they had last week, when she visited Amstor with her two children, was their final one. \"I'm really worried about her. She was working in exactly the part of the building where the rocket had hit,\" the 50-year-old psychologist said. \"It's very, very painful.\"\n\nKremenchuk was a city in agony Tuesday, as cranes and excavators pulled at the rubble of the mall, where many people may yet lie buried.\n\nRegional governor Dmytro Lunin told reporters that 36 people were still missing, with hopes fading that they would be found alive. Fifty-nine others had been injured in the attack, including 25 who were hospitalized.\n\nUkrainian Prosecutor-General Irina Venediktova visited this quiet mid-sized city Tuesday and said the air strike on the mall qualified as the latest in a long list of war crimes committed by the Russian military since it launched its invasion of Ukraine four months ago.\n\n\"I am sure that it is a war crime under Ukrainian legislation,\" she said. \"And I am sure that it is a crime against humanity under the Rome Statute.\n\n\"We see it systematically - shelling Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, hospitals, kindergartens, malls, as we see now. Why are they doing [this]? I'm sure that Russians know very well that they are just killing civilians ... but they are doing it again and again.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said there were 1,000 people near and in the mall at the time of the attack, called for Russia to be declared a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\nRussia's Defence Ministry denied that it had attacked the mall. In an official statement Tuesday, it instead claimed to have struck \"a weapons depot storing arms received from the United States and Europe,\" causing an explosion that started the fire at Amstor - which Moscow falsely described as \"a non-functioning shopping centre.\"\n\nMr. Lunin dismissed Russia's claim that there was a military target anywhere near the Kremenchuk mall. \"You can come with me, and I can show you this is an absolutely civilian object,\" he said, standing in front of a table of burned stuffed animals and a sign that said \"bread\" that had been recovered from the ruins of the mall. \"There are no weapons here, there is no warehouse.\"\n\nHe said Ukraine knew the name of the Russian pilot who had fired the pair of X-22 cruise missiles that struck the shopping centre, adding that his country \"would not forgive\" what had happened.\n\nMonday's attack came as the G7 was concluding a summit in Germany, where leaders vowed to continue sending financial and military aid to Ukraine. Tuesday marks the opening of a NATO meeting in Spain, where the military alliance will formally announce a major enlargement of its high-readiness force to counter the threat of Russian expansionism.\n\nOne of the reasons so many people died inside the mall was that many shoppers and staff did not heed an air-raid siren that sounded several minutes before the missiles hit.\n\n\"Unfortunately, those people who died have died because they ignored the rule of going to the shelters,\" Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky said. \"I would like to appeal to state-owned companies, privately owned companies, everyone: If you hear air-raid alarm, you need to react immediately because it's about the safety of your staff and everyone around.\"\n\nAn air-raid siren sounded in Kremenchuk minutes after Mr. Monastyrsky spoke. While rescue work was suspended, and police and firefighters moved away from the mall, only a small minority of those around the disaster scene headed into a nearby bomb shelter.\n\nAfter four months of war, many Ukrainians have stopped taking cover each and every time they hear the alarm. Local residents said the Amstor mall had actually picked up business from its bigger rival in town, the New Line Mall - which would immediately suspend operations for a siren, occasionally irritating customers who were moments away from completing their shopping - precisely because shoppers knew that Amstor would remain open.\n\n\"Even I would go to Amstor because it wouldn't close during alarms. We would just look at our phones, and if we saw it was an alarm for all of Ukraine, we would keep going,\" said Olga Maslova, a lawyer who was helping a family look for their missing daughter Tuesday. Ms. Maslova said she feared the young woman was dead, since police had asked the family for DNA samples.\n\nAmstor's policy of staying open during air-raid sirens made it difficult for those who worked there to abandon their posts if they felt unsafe.\n\nAlyona Makarenko, a local psychologist, said her aunt Olga worked alone at a kiosk that sold lottery tickets. She was financially responsible for the tickets and couldn't leave the kiosk unattended with people still in the mall, so Olga only fled after the missiles hit the building Monday.\n\nMs. Makarenko said her aunt described a nightmarish scene of stumbling through a thick cloud of black smoke, past the injured and dying, some of them missing limbs, as she tried to find the exit. \"It's a mystery how she managed to escape. Somehow, blinded in the smoke, she found her way out.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/-fOgX0zDk-NVV6uN1bYWOIjYp5U=/560x0/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tgam/BH3QJAKAEFF2RLIF57HUTECXQ4.JPG", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 18, "stanza_neu": 26, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 44, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7095590097", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-29", "time": "02:22:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-29T02:22:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-29T02:14:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4705882370471954, "url": "https://balloon-juice.com/war-for-ukraine-day-125-nato-is-set-to-expand-the-price-will-be-paid-by-the-kurds/", "title": "War For Ukraine Day 125: NATO Is Set To Expand. The Price Will Be Paid By the Kurds", "body": "Here's President Zelenskyy's address from earlier this evening. Video below, English transcript after the jump: (emphasis mine)\n\nUkrainians!\n\nAll our defenders!\n\nI have just taken part in a special meeting of the UN Security Council convened at the request of Ukraine. Convened by Albania - this state presides in the Security Council. We have taken advantage of all international levers to bring Russia to justice for state terrorism. For everything done by the Russian army against Ukrainians in Kremenchuk, in Ochakiv, in Lysychansk, in Kharkiv, in Dnipro, in many, many other cities of Ukraine. As of this evening, the total number of Russian missiles that have hit our cities is already 2,811. And there are many more air bombs, many artillery shells...\n\nThe UN Security Council today stood in silence to commemorate all Ukrainians killed by the Russian army on our land. The members of the Russian delegation looked at everyone present in the Security Council and also decided to stand up - just so as not to look like outright murderers. But everyone knows that it is Russian terror, it is the Russian state that is killing innocent people in this war waged against the Ukrainian people.\n\nI called on the UN to use the existing mechanisms of the Charter to stop Russian manipulation of the Organization's structures and to set up a special tribunal to investigate the actions of the Russian occupiers on Ukrainian soil.\n\nUkraine's law enforcement and intelligence agencies are doing their best to identify all Russian servicemen responsible for the terror against our cities. The names, faces and all information about each of these terrorists will be known to the world. None of them will be able to avoid responsibility, and personal sanctions will not be enough for these people. A sentence and imprisonment are the minimum they deserve.\n\nAnd I wish to say separately about the responsibility of those Russian propagandists who lie about this terror, who are trying to justify the actions of the Russian army. Each of you will also be punished. We have all the evidence of what the Russian troops are doing against our people.\n\nToday, I want to end this address with one such piece of evidence - so that no one dares to deceive about the missile strike at the shopping mall in Kremenchuk. The Russian missile hit this very object, purposefully. Obviously, that was the order. It is obvious that Russian assassins received such coordinates for this missile. They wanted to kill as many people as possible in a peaceful city, in a regular shopping mall. Here is what happened in Kremenchuk:\n\n(Video)\n\nAnd for this act of state terrorism, as for all others, Russia will be responsible. On the battlefield in Ukraine, by the strengthening of sanctions and, of course, in the tribunal.\n\nI am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine. Today I signed a new decree on awarding our heroes. 314 more combatants were awarded state awards.\n\nEternal glory to our defenders!\n\nGlory to Ukraine!\n\nAs of now there is no operational update from Ukraine's MOD posted.\n\nAs you can see there's still not a lot of movement at the macro level. In the comments last night asked if we could do some map comparisons over the last couple of weeks. This is a great idea. So you've got today's map above and below we've got from - top to bottom - yesterday's, 22 June, 19 June, 12 June, 8 June, 1 June, and 31 May.\n\nI hope that seeing them one above the next helps you all visualize just how stable the lines are at the macro level over the past month. Where you actually see movement, which is Ukraine attritting the Russians and pushing them back, is in the south around/near/in Kherson, which isn't getting a lot of coverage because all the reporters up near Sievierodonetsk.\n\nWe have some additional footage from the strike on the shopping mall yesterday. Here is specifically the clip that President Zelenskyy highlighted in his address:\n\nAnd here's multiple different video streams of the effects of the strike from a park adjacent to the Amstor mall in Kremenchuck. As far as I can tell no one in the video is injured. You can, however, actually see the blast wave in several of the clips.\n\nAnd Norway has stepped up with an important addition to Ukraine's arsenal:\n\nApparently Finland and Norway came to terms with Turkey, which has resulted in Turkey lifting its threat to block their ascension into NATO. The price, as is always the case when dealing with Erdogan, will be paid by the Kurds.\n\nAll of this was to help Erdogan shore up his standing ahead of his facing reelection.\n\nAnd here's a video from Patron's official TikTok page!", "source": {"uri": "balloon-juice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Balloon Juice"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_l_silverman@balloon-juice.com", "name": "Adam L Silverman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 40, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 52, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094115191", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "23:25:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T23:25:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T22:56:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4705882370471954, "url": "https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/missiles-strike-ukraine-shopping-mall-g7-vows-to-keep-pressure-on-russia-2", "title": "Missiles strike Ukraine shopping mall; G7 vows to keep pressure on Russia", "body": "KREMENCHUK -- Russian missiles struck a crowded shopping mall in central Ukraine on Monday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, as Moscow fought for control of a key eastern city and Western leaders promised to support Kyiv in the war \"as long as it takes.\"\n\nMore than 1,000 people were inside when two Russian missiles slammed into the mall in the city of Kremenchuk, southeast of Kyiv, Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.

Lysychansk is the last major area of the province under Ukrainian control following the retreat of Ukraine's forces from the neighboring city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nRussian troops and their separatist allies control 95% of Luhansk and about half of the Donetsk region, the other province that makes up the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Authorities in the city declared three days of mourning.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Services press officer Svitlana Rybalko told The Associated Press that along with the 18 people killed, investigators found fragments of eight more bodies. It was not immediately clear whether that meant there were more victims. A number of survivors suffered severed limbs.\n\n\"The police cannot say for sure how many (victims) there are. So we are finding not the bodies but the fragments of bodies,\" Rybalko said. \"Now we are clearing at the very epicenter of the blast. Here, we practically cannot find bodies as such.\"\n\nSeveral families stood by what was left of the Amstor shopping center Wednesday morning in hope of finding missing loved ones.\n\n\"This is pure genocide,\" local resident Tatiana Chernyshova said while going to lay flowers at the site. \"Such things cannot happen in the 21st century.\"\n\n\"We need to engage everyone to help stop the war, help us fight these scum -- these Russian aggressors,\" Chernyshova said.\n\nPsychologists working at the site with families said they were trying to help people come to terms with their loss.\n\n\"We are trying to help them release their emotions now, as later it becomes harder and much more painful,\" said one psychologist, who did not give his name as he was not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nAfter the attack on the mall, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of becoming \"a terrorist\" state. On Wednesday, he reproached NATO for not embracing or equipping his embattled country more fully.\n\n\"The open-door policy of NATO shouldn't resemble old turnstiles on Kyiv's subway, which stay open but close when you approach them until you pay,\" Zelenskyy told NATO leaders meeting in Madrid, speaking by video link. \"Hasn't Ukraine paid enough? Hasn't our contribution to defending Europe and the entire civilization been sufficient?\"\n\nHe asked for more modern artillery systems and other weapons and warned the NATO leaders they either had to provide Ukraine with the help it needed to defeat Russia or \"face a delayed war between Russia and yourself.\"\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Wednesday dismissed what she claimed was the Ukrainian government's \"blatant provocation\" in trying to blame the mall missile strike on Russia's military.\n\nBritain's defense ministry said there was a \"realistic possibility\" that the mall strike \"was intended to hit a nearby infrastructure target.\"\n\n\"Russian planners highly likely remain willing to accept a high level of collateral damage when they perceive military necessity in striking a target,\" the ministry said. \"It is almost certain that Russia will continue to conduct strikes in an effort to interdict the resupplying of Ukrainian front-line forces.\"\n\nRussia's military also is experiencing a shortage of more modern precision strike weapons that is compounding civilian casualties, the British ministry said.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, a Russian missile strike on a multi-story apartment building Wednesday in the city of Mykolaiv killed at least four people and injured five, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said. Mykolaiv is a major port and seizing it -- as well as Odesa further west -- would be key to Russia's objective of cutting off Ukraine from its Black Sea coast.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said in a statement that the missile strike on Mykolaiv targeted a base for training \"foreign mercenaries,\" as well as ammunition depots.\n\nKyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko on Tuesday urged NATO leaders in Madrid to do whatever it took to stop the war, saying that if Ukraine is defeated, \"you're going to be next.\"\n\nIn other developments:\n\n-- A senior Russian lawmaker has warned that Lithuania's refusal to allow some goods targeted by European Union sanctions through to Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad could trigger a military confrontation.\n\nWednesday's statement by Vladimir Dzhabarov, a deputy head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of Russia's parliament, followed the Kremlin's warning that it will retaliate against restrictions of transit to Kaliningrad. The region borders EU and NATO members Poland and Lithuania.\n\n-- Russia's foreign ministry summoned Norway's charge d'affaires to protest Oslo's blocking of a shipment of supplies to a Russian coal-mining town in the Svalbard islands.\n\nAlthough the Svalbards are Norwegian territory, a 1920 treaty allows all signatory countries the right to exploit its natural resources. Russia operates a coal mine in Barentsburg, a settlement of about 450 people, which relies on shipments from the mainland of food, machinery and other supplies. Norway imposed sanctions on shipments from Russia in April.\n\n-- Ukrainian military intelligence says that in the largest prisoner swap since the start of the war 144 Ukrainian troops were released from Russian captivity. Of those released, 95 were involved in defending the Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's devastated southern city of Mariupol that Russian forces captured weeks ago. There was no word on how many Russian soldiers were freed in return.\n\n-- European Union leaders approved Wednesday a 600-million euro ($631 million) package to address food security issues brought on by the Ukraine war in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.\n\n-- Britain is imposing sanctions on Russia's second-richest man and on a cousin of President Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Potanin, owner of the Interross conglomerate, has continued to amass wealth while backing Putin, acquiring Rosbank and shares in Tinkoff Bankonith in the period following the invasion of Ukraine, a U.K. government statement said Wednesday.\n\nThe statement said Putin's cousin, Anna Tsivileva, and her husband, Sergey Tsivilev, have \"significantly benefited\" from their relationship with Putin. Tsivileva is president of the JSC Kolmar Group coal mining company, and Tsivilev is governor of the coal-rich Kemerovo region.\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

The most likely scenario predicted by American intelligence, Haines said, is a \"grinding struggle\" in which Russia consolidates its hold over southern Ukraine by the fall.\n\nThe U.S. correctly predicted Russia would invade Ukraine in February, but was wrong in assessing that it would quickly seize Kyiv. Speaking at an event in Washington on Wednesday, Haines said Russian President Vladimir Putin \"has effectively the same political goals that he had previously, which is to say that he wants to take most of Ukraine\" and push it away from NATO.\n\n\"We perceive a disconnect between Putin's near-term military objectives in this area and his military's capacity, a kind of mismatch between his ambitions and what the military is able to accomplish,\" Haines said.\n\nPutin also said his goals in Ukraine have not changed since the start of the war. He said they were \"the liberation of the Donbas, the protection of these people and the creation of conditions that would guarantee the security of Russia itself.\" He made no mention of his original stated goals to \"demilitarize\" and \"de-Nazify\" Ukraine.\n\nHe denied Russia adjusted its strategy after failing to take Kyiv. \"As you can see, the troops are moving and reaching the marks that were set for them for a certain stage of this combat work. Everything is going according to plan,\" Putin said at a news conference in Turkmenistan.\n\nMeanwhile, crews continued to search through the rubble of the shopping mall in Kremenchuk where Ukrainian authorities say 20 people remain missing.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Services press officer Svitlana Rybalko told The Associated Press that along with the 18 people killed, investigators found fragments of eight more bodies. It was not immediately clear whether that meant there were more victims. A number of survivors suffered severed limbs.\n\n\"The police cannot say for sure how many (victims) there are. So we are finding not the bodies but the fragments of bodies,\" Rybalko said. \"Now we are clearing at the very epicenter of the blast. Here, we practically cannot find bodies as such.\"\n\nSeveral families stood by what was left of the Amstor shopping center Wednesday morning in hope of finding missing loved ones.\n\n\"This is pure genocide,\" local resident Tatiana Chernyshova said while going to lay flowers at the site. \"Such things cannot happen in the 21st century.\"\n\n\"We need to engage everyone to help stop the war, help us fight these scum -- these Russian aggressors,\" Chernyshova said.\n\nPsychologists working at the site with families said they were trying to help people come to terms with their loss.\n\n\"We are trying to help them release their emotions now, as later it becomes harder and much more painful,\" said one psychologist, who did not give his name as he was not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nAfter the attack on the mall, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of becoming a \"terrorist\" state. On Wednesday, he reproached NATO for not embracing or equipping his embattled country more fully.\n\n\"The open-door policy of NATO shouldn't resemble old turnstiles on Kyiv's subway, which stay open but close when you approach them until you pay,\" Zelenskyy told NATO leaders meeting in Madrid, speaking by video link. \"Hasn't Ukraine paid enough? Hasn't our contribution to defending Europe and the entire civilization been sufficient?\"\n\nHe asked for more modern artillery systems and other weapons and warned the NATO leaders they either had to provide Ukraine with the help it needed to defeat Russia or \"face a delayed war between Russia and yourself.\"\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Wednesday dismissed what she claimed was the Ukrainian government's \"blatant provocation\" in trying to blame the mall missile strike on Russia's military.\n\nBritain's defense ministry said there was a \"realistic possibility\" that the mall strike \"was intended to hit a nearby infrastructure target.\"\n\n\"Russian planners highly likely remain willing to accept a high level of collateral damage when they perceive military necessity in striking a target,\" the ministry said. \"It is almost certain that Russia will continue to conduct strikes in an effort to interdict the resupplying of Ukrainian front-line forces.\"\n\nRussia's military also is experiencing a shortage of more modern precision strike weapons, which is compounding civilian casualties, the British ministry said.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, a Russian missile strike on a multi-story apartment building Wednesday in the city of Mykolaiv killed at least four people and injured five, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said. Mykolaiv is a major port and seizing it -- as well as Odesa farther west -- would be key to Russia's objective of cutting off Ukraine from its Black Sea coast.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said in a statement that the missile strike on Mykolaiv targeted a base for training \"foreign mercenaries,\" as well as ammunition depots.\n\nIn other developments Wednesday:\n\n-- A senior Russian lawmaker warned that Lithuania's refusal to allow some goods targeted by European Union sanctions through to Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad could trigger a military confrontation.\n\nThe statement by Vladimir Dzhabarov, a deputy head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of Russia's parliament, followed the Kremlin's warning that it will retaliate against restrictions of transit to Kaliningrad. The region borders EU and NATO members Poland and Lithuania.\n\n-- Russia's foreign ministry summoned Norway's charge d'affaires to protest Oslo's blocking of a shipment of supplies to a Russian coal-mining town in the Svalbard islands.\n\nAlthough the Svalbards are Norwegian territory, a 1920 treaty allows all signatory countries the right to exploit its natural resources. Russia operates a coal mine in Barentsburg, a settlement of about 450 people, which relies on shipments from the mainland of food, machinery and other supplies. Norway imposed sanctions on shipments from Russia in April.\n\n-- Ukrainian military intelligence says that in the largest prisoner swap since the start of the war 144 Ukrainian troops were released from Russian captivity. Of those released, 95 were involved in defending the Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's devastated southern city of Mariupol before Russian forces captured it weeks ago. Denis Pushilin, the separatist leader in Donetsk, said an equal number of soldiers was released by both sides.\n\n-- European Union leaders approved a 600-million euro ($631 million) package to address food security issues brought on by the Ukrainian war in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.\n\n-- British businessman Richard Branson met with Zelenskyy in Kyiv and also visited the Hostomel airport outside the city. Zelenskyy said Branson, whose Virgin Group includes an airline, may be interested in rebuilding the airport, which was badly damaged early in the war.\n\n-- Britain is imposing sanctions on Russia's second-richest man and on a cousin of Putin's. Vladimir Potanin, owner of the Interross conglomerate, has continued to amass wealth while backing Putin, acquiring Rosbank and shares in Tinkoff Bankonith in the period following the invasion of Ukraine, a U.K. government statement said Wednesday.\n\nThe statement said Putin's cousin, Anna Tsivileva, and her husband, Sergey Tsivilev, have \"significantly benefited\" from their relationship with Putin. Tsivileva is president of the JSC Kolmar Group coal mining company, and Tsivilev is governor of the coal-rich Kemerovo region.\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

Reuters and multiple other sources report that more than a thousand people were in the mall at the time of the strike; the official preliminary casualty report from Ukraine puts the dead at sixteen, with fifty-nine injured. It was a civilian, not a military target. There are only three possibilities: either the Russians misidentified the mall as a military target (in an intelligence failure) or the weapons failed to hit whatever else they may have been aimed at (in an operational failure), or the Russian air force knew exactly what it was shooting at (and hit it). Ukraine has adopted the third explanation, which indeed is by far the most likely, and denounced the strike as as act of terrorism. \"This is not an accidental hit, this is a calculated Russian strike exactly onto this shopping centre,\" Ukrainian President Zelenskiy said in an address yesterday evening.\n\nUkraine was joined not only by NATO and other sympathetic powers in its condemnation, but by the United Nations as well, which called the attack \"utterly deplorable,\" and it was deplorable whatever the casualties ultimately turn out to be. UN Spokesperson, St\u00e9phane Dujarric said, \"Any sort of civilian infrastructure, which includes obviously shopping malls, and civilians, should never ever be targeted,\" Moscow has so far not commented on the attack, but Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, dismissed the incident as opportunistic Ukrainian propaganda, perhaps an outright provocation. \"One should wait for what our Ministry of Defence will say, but there are too many striking discrepancies already,\" Mr. Polyanskiy said. It's unclear what those discrepancies might be.\n\nThe weapons used were two X-22s (also called a Kh-22, \"X\" and \"Kh\" being alternative Roman transliterations of the Cyrillic letter), a large, air-launched anti-ship missile deployed by the Soviets in 1962 and tracked by NATO as the AS-4 Kitchen. The X-22 has a range of about 600 kilometers and carries a thousand kilograms of high explosive. The Kitchen is an old system and isn't regarded as highly accurate by contemporary missile standards, but it's capable of hitting a big, stationary target (like a shopping mall).\n\nUkraine's calling the attack \"terrorism\" isn't idle name-calling. Kyiv has asked Western governments to designate Russia as a state-sponsor of terrorism, with all that implies under international law. (Minimally, the Washington Post observes, it would solidify Russia's place as an international pariah. Four nations--Cuba, North Korea, Iran and Syria--are currently designated state sponsors of terrorism by the US State Department.) While French President Macron declined to go that far, he called the attack \"a war crime\" and said that NATO and the G7 needed no further reason to tighten the sanctions already in place against Russia. President Zelenskyy has asked the West to help Ukraine expel Russian forces before winter, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nThe US Department of Defense says that it sees two significant trends in Russia's war against Ukraine: continuing and damaging morale problems in the ranks of the Russian forces, and a growing incidence of Ukrainian partisan activity against Russian occupiers. \"Over the last several days, we've become aware of assassinations of local Russian officials. And we're also aware that reporting suggests Ukrainians have been successful in liberating several small towns northwest and west of Kherson.\"\n\nToday's situation report from the UK's Ministry of Defence reports on the current state of Ukrainian defenses around Lysychansk. \"Ukrainian forces continue to consolidate their positions on higher ground in the city of Lyschansk, after falling back from Sieverodonetsk. Ukrainian forces continue to disrupt Russian command and control with successful strikes deep behind Russian lines.\" It went on to comment on the weekend's wave of missile strikes, many of which were conducted with legacy weapons ill-suited to Russia's current tactical requirements. \"Over 24-26 June, Russia launched unusually intense waves of strikes across Ukraine using long-range missiles. These weapons highly likely included the Soviet-era AS-4 KITCHEN and more modern AS-23a KODIAK missiles, fired from both Belarusian and Russian airspace. These weapons were designed to take on targets of strategic importance, but Russia continues to expend them in large numbers for tactical advantage. Similarly, it fielded the core elements of six different armies yet achieved only tactical success at Sieverodonetsk. The Russian armed forces are increasingly hollowed out. They currently accept a level of degraded combat effectiveness, which is probably unsustainable in the long term.\"\n\nUkraine is expending its Soviet-era ordnance rapidly, and is asking for accelerated deliveries of NATO artillery and ammunition to replace it, the Guardian reports. NATO has been supplying both Soviet-era ammunition and new NATO standard systems, but at this point the international market for legacy ammunition is drying up, and Ukraine will become increasingly reliant on shipments of newer, NATO-standard weapons. Among the newer NATO artillery systems now in action with Ukrainian forces are US-built M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Task & Purpose reports. \"These weapons are in the good hands, dear Americans!\" Ukraine's Ministry of Defense tweeted in text accompanying video of HIMARS in action. It's taken less than a month from their arrival to put the HIMARS to use, but supply remains a race in a gunner's and rocketeer's war.\n\nLithuania has said that the distributed denial-of-service attacks it's sustaining \"probably\" originate with Russia, SecurityWeek reports. According to CNN, the nominally hacktivist outfit Killnet has now claimed responsibility (the Cyber-Spetsnaz subgroup apparently having faded from the communiqu\u00e9s), and the Lithuanian government expects the attacks to continue, perhaps intensify, in coming days. \"Part of the Secure National Data Transfer Network users have been unable to access services, work is in progress to restore it to normal,\" Lithuania's National Cyber Security Centre (NKSC) said. \"It is highly probable that such, or even more, intense attacks will continue into the coming days, especially against the communications, energy and financial sectors.\" Lithuania is attracting Russian attention because of its refusal to allow prohibited goods to be shipped over its rail lines to Russia's non-contiguous region of Kaliningrad, an enclave surrounded by Lithuanian and Polish territory.\n\nFlashpoint, which has been following Killnet and related pro-Russian chatter, finds that chatter to be notably aggressive. \"Flashpoint has identified chatter on various pro-Russian Telegram channels claiming that the current standoff between Russia and Lithuania could escalate to a full-fledged military confrontation, although no evidence of physical violence is yet to take place between Russia and Lithuania as of this publishing.\"", "source": {"uri": "thecyberwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The CyberWire"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://thecyberwire.com/images/social-media/articles/pro/cw-pro-image-72.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 32, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 45, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094275687", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "03:59:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T03:59:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T03:59:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4666666686534882, "url": "https://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/world/putin-will-be-escalating-russias-missile-strikes-on-ukraine-to-make-a-point/video/efe9a1ec1fc96cbd5e7bec4745d08a99", "title": "Putin will be &#8216;escalating&#8217; Russia&#8217;s missile strikes on Ukraine to &#8216;make a point&#8217;", "body": "Ukraine Ambassador to Australia Vasyl Myroshnychenko says Russian President Vladimir will be \"escalating\" his missile strikes on Ukraine to \"make a point\".\n\nIn the latest attacks against Ukraine, Russia has launched a missile strike on a busy shopping centre in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk, which led to several deaths and multiple people getting injured.\n\n\"I am very concerned, and that was a deliberate attack at a civilian site, which is a shopping mall, in the middle of the day,\" he told Sky News Australia.\n\n\"It's very hard in Kyiv now.\n\n\"This is really appalling, but I think Putin's making a statement, he's really sending a signal to the G7 countries.\"", "source": {"uri": "geelongadvertiser.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Geelong Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/82042ceecc7f3d7d00e055d1b5a6f23c", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 1, "stanza_neu": 4, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 5, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7094105756", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "23:09:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T23:09:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T22:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4666666686534882, "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russias-mall-bombing-strategy-ukraine-kremenchuk-missile-strike-vladimir-putin-11656363631", "title": "Opinion | Russia's Mall Bombing Strategy", "body": "Missiles strike a Ukraine shopping center with 1,000 civilians inside.\n\nVladimir Putin's war in Ukraine has receded from American media attention, but Russia's brutality continues.

by two Russian guided cruise missiles on Monday as about 1,000 shoppers and employees were supposed to be inside just before the strike.\n\nDrone footage released on Tuesday morning showed the roof over the central section of the sprawling building entirely collapsed and turned into a pile of rubble with the wings of the building mangled.\n\nFirefighters were pictured walking around the ruins

scene through the night to put out the fire and let the rescue teams search for the missing people but hopes of finding someone alive amid the smouldering ruins were increasingly dim by Tuesday afternoon.\n\nRussia's defence ministry has claimed responsibility for yesterday's deadly bombing but insisted it did not know what the mall was open.\n\nIgor Konashenkov, spokesman for the Russian military, said on Tuesday morning that Russia on Monday used \"high-precision weapons\" to target hangers at a local factory storing fresh ammunition and weapons supplies from the US and Europe.\n\nMr Konashenkov said the Russia airstrike destroyed the weaponry that was bound to be sent to the eastern Ukraine, the epicentre of the war's heaviest fighting.\n\nHe admitted that the shopping centre \"caught fire\" because of the Russian attack but insisted that Moscow thought it was shut down.\n\n\"Ammunition for Western weaponry stored at the warehouse detonated, causing a fire at a shopping

Convened by Albania - this state presides in the Security Council. We have taken advantage of all international levers to bring Russia to justice for state terrorism. For everything done by the Russian army against Ukrainians in Kremenchuk, in Ochakiv, in Lysychansk, in Kharkiv, in Dnipro, in many, many other cities of Ukraine. As of this evening, the total number of Russian missiles that have hit our cities is already 2,811. And there are many more air bombs, many artillery shells...\n\nThe UN Security Council today stood in silence to commemorate all Ukrainians killed by the Russian army on our land. The members of the Russian delegation looked at everyone present in the Security Council and also decided to stand up - just so as not to look like outright murderers. But everyone knows that it is Russian terror, it is the Russian state that is killing innocent people in this war waged against the Ukrainian people.\n\nI called on the UN to use the existing mechanisms of the Charter to stop Russian manipulation of the Organization's structures and to set up a special tribunal to investigate the actions of the Russian occupiers on Ukrainian soil.\n\nUkraine's law enforcement and intelligence agencies are doing their best to identify all Russian servicemen responsible for the terror against our cities. The names, faces and all information about each of these terrorists will be known to the world. None of them will be able to avoid responsibility, and personal sanctions will not be enough for these people. A sentence and imprisonment are the minimum they deserve.\n\nAnd I wish to say separately about the responsibility of those Russian propagandists who lie about this terror, who are trying to justify the actions of the Russian army. Each of you will also be punished. We have all the evidence of what the Russian troops are doing against our people.\n\nToday, I want to end this address with one such piece of evidence - so that no one dares to deceive about the missile strike at the shopping mall in Kremenchuk. The Russian missile hit this very object, purposefully. Obviously, that was the order. It is obvious that Russian assassins received such coordinates for this missile. They wanted to kill as many people as possible in a peaceful city, in a regular shopping mall. Here is what happened in Kremenchuk:\n\nAnd for this act of state terrorism, as for all others, Russia will be responsible. On the battlefield in Ukraine, by the strengthening of sanctions and, of course, in the tribunal.\n\nI am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine.

Ukrainian officials think Russian President Vladimir Putin was sending a grim message to both groups that he can win this war, despite Western sanctions. Never mind how many innocent civilians Russia kills.\n\n\" READ MORE: The critical battles for Ukraine are being fought right here, right now.\n\nNeither angry rhetoric -- nor more sanctions -- will stop Russia's war crimes in time to save Ukraine. How many Russian atrocities will it take to convince European leaders -- and the Biden team -- that there is only one way to halt Putin: Provide Ukraine with (still-absent) long-range heavy weapons to counter Putin's bombs and missiles and push Russian invaders off its land.\n\nJudging by the G-7 meeting, Washington and its allies don't have the will, or the sense of urgency, to help Ukraine save itself and the West from Putin's imperial lust.\n\n\"This is not an accidental hit, this is a calculated Russian strike exactly onto this shopping center,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said after the Kremenchuk attack.\n\nAt the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday, Zelensky rightly called Putin's Russia a \"terrorist state,\" listing scores of missiles unleashed on civilians in several Ukrainian cities, killing many women and children, just over the past four days. \"In any other part of the world [these daily attacks] would be called terrorism,\" Zelensky said.\n\nHe is correct. Yet words won't stop Moscow's terrorist assault.\n\nVladimir Putin is the unabashed lord of war crimes in the 21st century. Or as his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, put it last week, \"Russia is not squeaky clean. Russia is what it is. And we are not ashamed of showing what we are.\"\n\nAs if the constant targeting of civilians is insufficiently criminal, Putin's Russia has also blockaded Ukrainian ports, preventing the export of grain that is desperately needed to feed citizens of Africa and the Middle East.\n\nOf course, the Russians deny every atrocity, from the deliberate destruction of thousands of schools, hospitals, and civilian high-rise apartment buildings across the country.\n\nThis is not the \"normal\" carnage of war. Firstly, the battles in Ukraine are not the consequence of war, but of an unprovoked invasion by Russia. They are on orders of an all-powerful Putin, who -- like Hitler -- makes no secret of his imperialist ambitions to seize neighboring land he believes was wrongfully taken from historic Russia. That includes Ukraine, which Putin says has no right to be a state.\n\nMore to the point, Putin is pursuing a deliberate strategy of laying waste to cities, towns, and villages using long-range artillery, bombs, and rockets, since his troops are unable to defeat Ukrainian forces in close battle. He is trying to take over Ukraine chunk by chunk, at present in the eastern Donbas region, and in the south along the Black Sea.\n\nPutin's goal is to unilaterally annex these chunks into Russia, leaving an economically unviable rump Ukraine cut off from its agricultural and industrial heartlands, and its sea ports. Then he can regroup and try again to take Kyiv.\n\nIn the words of one of Putin's acolytes, former Russian President Dimitry Medvedev (a sycophant, who like Donald Trump's Rudy Giuliani, says what even the boss won't acknowledge publicly): \"Who said that in two years Ukraine will even exist on the world map?\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Putin's new war crime: starving world's poor by blocking Ukraine's grain exports.\n\nNATO allies like France and Germany, reeling from higher gas prices, nurture hopes that Putin can be coaxed somehow into negotiations. This is self-delusion. Putin has twisted and broken every agreement Russia has made with Ukraine.\n\nThat includes the 1994 Helsinki agreement by which Washington, London, and Moscow agreed to respect Ukraine's sovereignty if it gave up the nuclear weapons it had acquired during the days of the Soviet Union, and the so-called Minsk negotiating framework that Moscow agreed to after invading eastern Ukraine in 2014. Putin scorned them both.\n\nAt the G-7 meeting, a frustrated Zelensky appealed to leaders for more military support to push Russia out of newly conquered territory in the east and south before winter, when the frozen ground will make it easier for Russian forces to move tanks, artillery, and supplies.\n\nUkraine cannot withstand a long war of attrition, in which the Russians lay waste to the country with unlimited artillery, rocket, and air strikes.\n\nThe West's drip, drip, drip of heavy weapons -- always too little and too late to prevent Putin's war crimes from the air -- is helping to kill Ukraine slowly. As NATO nations meet, they must decide whether they want to permit Putin's terrorist attacks to continue -- or whether they will finally accelerate the shipments of weapons that Ukraine needs to win.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "trudy_rubin@inquirer.com", "name": "Trudy Rubin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/YFh9xdf1IRtCVNWf50waWHuhd3g=/760x507/smart/filters:format(webp)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/pmn/G25LNTJXC5FFPBJDFUZ575IEVY.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 28, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 41, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093938680", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "19:21:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T19:21:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T19:21:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4549019634723663, "url": "https://www.channel4.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-missiles-strike-crowded-ukraine-shopping-centre", "title": "Russia Ukraine war: Missiles strike crowded Ukraine shopping centre", "body": "At least 10 people have been confirmed dead, with 50 others injured after a Russian missile strike slammed into a crowded shopping centre in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk.\n\nHundreds of people are feared to have been inside at the time.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy said it had presented \"no threat to the Russian army\" and accused Moscow of sabotaging \"people's attempts to live a normal life\".\n\nWhile at the G7 leaders' summit in Germany, Boris Johnson condemned what he called Vladimir Putin's \"cruelty and barbarism\".", "source": {"uri": "channel4.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Channel 4"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paraic_o_brien@channel4.com", "name": "Paraic O'Brien", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://fournews-assets-prod-s3-ew1-nmprod.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2022/06/UKRAINE-1920x1080.png", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.7176470588235294, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 3, "stanza_neu": 1, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 4, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093891349", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "18:26:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T18:26:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T18:26:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4549019634723663, "url": "https://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/national/at-least-10-dead-after-russian-missile-hits-ukrainian-shopping-mall/video/b0c6861a6c8126744983878afd6c65b1", "title": "At Least 10 Dead After Russian Missile Hits Ukrainian Shopping Mall", "body": "According to local authorities, a Russian missile hit a shopping mall in Kremenchuk, Ukraine, on Monday, June 27.

Security Council on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy -- who previously labelled Russia's strike on a shopping mall in the central city of Kremenchuk a \"terrorist attack\" -- told world leaders that \"It is necessary to act immediately, and do everything for Russia to stop killing children, people, everyone.\"\n\n\"We must hold Russia accountable for terrorism,\" he added.\n\nZelenskyy spoke to diplomats at an emergency council meeting that was called by Ukraine in response to the shopping center missile strike. Officials said 18 were confirmed dead and at least 36 people are still missing.\n\nUkraine's president called for \"a special international tribunal to investigate Russian occupants' actions on Ukrainian soil,\" and asked for a moment of silence for civilians killed in the attack.\n\n\"Different countries of the world can have different attitudes towards war, to any war,\" Zelenskyy said. \"But in every country in the world, the memory of the dead is equally honored.\"\n\n\"I am grateful to all the honest and civilized states that share our position and help protect international law,\" Zelenskyy added.\n\nZelenskyy also called for the removal of the Russia delegation, and suggested the Security Council should, \"continue 24 hours a day to discuss every terrorist act of the Russian state.\"\n\n\"Russia has no right to participate in negotiations and voting on the war against Ukraine,\" he said. \"...I urge you to remove the delegation of terrorist state from power in the U.N. General Assembly.\"\n\n\"This is a must. This is only fair. This is fair. Russia has no right to stay,\" Zelenskyy added.\n\nDeputy Representative to the United Nations for the U.S. Richard Mills told the council, \"We were honored by his presence here, but I think we're all horrified by the circumstances under which we meet...It would already be an outrage if yesterday's attack was a horrific exception. But it is not even that.\"\n\n\"The attack fits into a cruel pattern, one where the Russian military kills civilians and destroys civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. The Kremlin has demonstrated time and time again that it is trying to subjugate Ukraine - its sovereignty, its people, its spirit,\" Mills said.\n\nBefore the Russian delegation spoke, Mills cautioned diplomats, saying, \"I expect the representative from the Russian Federation, in a moment, to try to obfuscate, to avoid responsibility, and blame others for this tragedy. But no one here will be fooled.\"\n\nMills added that evidence Russia has committed war crimes is \"mounting, and it cannot be ignored.\"\n\nRussian Deputy Ambassador Dmitry Polyansky -- who stood for the moment of silence -- referred to \"Western propagandist collaborators\" and told diplomats that \"by supplying weapons you only prolong the agony...\"\n\nThe U.K.'s ambassador to the U.N., Barbara Woodward, took aim at Russia's response, saying, \"the Russian representative can try to claim that nothing is true and make outrageous claims of Ukrainian provocations. Cover ups are as old as crime itself, but the undeniable fact is that Russian forces are in Ukraine, and there are no Ukrainian forces in Russia. There is one aggressor here. The evidence will catch up with them and there will be accountability for these crimes.\"\n\nThe Biden administration's envoy, referring to the recent G-7 meeting focusing on support for Ukraine and continuing penalties against Russia, said, \"the world has come together to say enough is enough.\"\n\nPrior to Tuesday's meting, several council members issued a statement condemning Russia's recent missile strikes and demanded an immediate cessation of hostilities against Ukraine.\n\nThe war in Ukraine continues to inflict a heavy civilian toll. U.N. Under Secretary General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo said Tuesday that, as of Sunday, 10,631 civilians had been killed in Ukraine. DiCarlo also addressed the continuing plight of Ukrainian refugees.\n\n\"Ukraine is suffering the largest human displacement crisis in the world today,\" she said. \"Since the start of the Russian invasion, more than one-quarter of the country's population -- 12 million people -- have been forced from their homes. Within Ukraine, over 7.1 million people remain displaced by the war. UNHCR estimates there are over 5.2 million refugees present across Europe.

A formal decision to invite Finland and Sweden to join is expected Wednesday, to be followed by NATO's ratification process.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the United Nations Security Council that Russia is acting like a \"terrorist\" state, going on a \"killing spree\" across Ukraine. Speaking via video, he read out names of Ukrainian victims of recent Russian attacks, saying the country has struck schools, a shopping mall and many other civilian targets. He said Russia has no right to remain in the powerful U.N. body.\n\nThe U.S. imposed new sanctions to punish Russia for its war in Ukraine. The sanctions include restrictions on 70 Russian defense-related businesses, including Rostec, a state-owned corporation \"considered to be the cornerstone of Russia's defense, industrial, technology, and manufacturing sectors,\" the State Department said. The U.S., along with G-7 countries, is also banning the import of Russian gold.\n\nProminent Russian opposition politician Ilya Yashin was detained in Moscow and sentenced to 15 days in prison on charges of disobeying police orders.

Hasn't our contribution to defending Europe and the entire civilisation been sufficient?\"\n\nHe asked for more modern artillery systems and other weapons and warned the leaders they either had to provide Ukraine with the help it needed to defeat Russia or \"face a delayed war between Russia and yourself\".\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed what she claimed was the Ukrainian government's \"blatant provocation\" in trying to blame the shopping centre missile strike on Russia's military.\n\n\"All these fakes, unfortunately, were replicated and distributed,\" Ms Zakharova said.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, a Russian missile strike in the city of Mykolaiv killed at least four people and injured five after a missile hit a multi-story apartment building on Wednesday, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said.\n\nMykolaiv is a major port in Ukraine's south and seizing it - as well as Odesa further west - would be key to Russia's object of cutting Ukraine off from its Black Sea coast.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said in a statement that the missile strike on Mykolaiv targeted a base for training \"foreign mercenaries\", as well as ammunition depots.\n\nSeparately, European Union leaders approved a 600 million euro (\u00a3519 million) package to address food security issues brought on by the Ukraine war on Wednesday.\n\nThe money, from European Development Fund reserves, will be earmarked for African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.\n\nAnd Britain is imposing sanctions on Russia's second-richest man and a cousin of Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Hundreds of people had been inside the mall.\n\nUkraine's top prosecutor, Irina Venediktova, arrived on the scene on Tuesday with a team of investigators to collect evidence about what she said constituted both a \"war crime\" under Ukrainian law and a crime against humanity.\n\nAbout 60 people had sought medical help, the mayor said. At a hospital where the wounded were being treated, five people were in critical condition, according to the chief doctor, Oksana Korlyakova.\n\nThe prosecutor denounced what she described as the \"systematic shelling of civilian infrastructure: hospitals, kindergartens, malls as you see here.\"\n\n\"I am sure the Russians know very well that they are killing civilians,\" Ms. Venediktova added. \"For them it is not news, but they do it again and again.\"\n\nRussia's defense ministry acknowledged in a statement on Tuesday that it had struck Kremenchuk with what it described as high-precision missiles. But it said the mall had been set ablaze by an explosion at its primary target, which it said was depots containing munitions for weapons systems supplied by the United States and European countries.\n\nThe claims could not be independently verified, and Ukraine's interior minister said at a briefing for journalists on Tuesday that \"there is no military object in a five-kilometer radius.\"\n\nIn a small park next to the shopping center, a makeshift memorial of 16 vases filled with flowers had been set up. Somber visitors lit candles for the dead.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in an evening video address that the strike was intentional. \"This is not an accidental hit -- this is a calculated Russian strike,\" he said.\n\nThis was the sixth and most deadly Russian missile strike on Kremenchuk, an industrial city that had a prewar population of 217,000. Although some residents have left, many displaced people have also arrived from places further east that have faced heavy bombardment, such as Kharkiv and Mariupol.\n\nAmong the wounded in Monday's strike was Yulia, 22, who had fled to Kremenchuk from Kharkiv with her mother. They previously lived in Luhansk, a city that was occupied by Moscow-backed separatists in 2014.\n\nYulia and her mother, Larisa, had fled to Kharkiv after the earlier fighting, and then two months ago fled again to Kremenchuk because of heavy shelling in Kharkiv. She had found a job selling mobile phones in the shopping center.\n\n\"We hoped we would be safe here,\" said Larisa, who did not feel comfortable sharing her last name. \"This is a deep trauma for my soul.\"\n\nIn the hours after the strike, pro-Moscow news outlets and social media channels were quick to dismiss the attack as staged by the Ukrainians.\n\n\"I want the world to know that this is not fake,\" Larisa said. \"People suffered, and it is very scary.\"\n\nIvan Nechepurenko contributed reporting from Tblisi, Georgia.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 6, "stanza_neu": 24, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 30, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7095885379", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-29", "time": "08:07:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-29T08:07:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-29T08:06:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4431372582912445, "url": "https://www.kyivpost.com/russias-war/designate-russia-as-a-state-sponsor-of-terrorism-zelensky-urges-western-leaders.html", "title": "\"Designate Russia as a State Sponsor of Terrorism!\" Zelensky Urges Western Leaders - KyivPost - Ukraine's Global Voice", "body": "President Volodymyr Zelensky on June 28 reiterated his call for the U.S. to name Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. This follows yesterday's Russian missile strike on a shopping mall in central Ukraine that killed 18 people and left dozens more injured.\n\nZelensky called the strike in the city of Kremenchuk \"one of the most brazen terrorist acts in European history\" in an address Monday evening, adding that \"only totally insane terrorists, who should have no place on earth, can strike missiles at such an object.\"\n\nAt least 60 people were injured in the attack, and 38 were missing as of Tuesday morning. A total of 18 were confirmed to have died.\n\nThe local governor, Dmytro Lunin, described the attack as a crime against humanity, writing on Telegram that it was \"an obvious and cynical act of terror against the civilian population\".\n\nAuthorities say 440 people from emergency services continue to work on the still-smoldering site, including 14 psychologists brought in to support survivors.\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven nations (G7), collectively condemned the attack as a war crime, with the U.N. Security Council set to discuss the strike a meeting today, at the request of the Ukrainian government.\n\nZelensky urged Washington and members of the G7 \"to recognize Russia as a state that sponsors terrorism,\" adding that the designation \"must be supported by the entire democratic world.\"\n\nIf such a designation were to be made, it would have a far-reaching impact, including economic penalties on dozens of nations that continue to trade with Russia or have alliances with Moscow. It would also lead to the freezing of Russian assets and the prohibition of a variety of exports, both commercial and military.\n\nThe label, which in the U.S. requires a finding by the secretary of state, can be imposed on any foreign nation that has \"repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism,\" according to a State Department fact sheet. Presently, the list of designated countries comprises only of North Korea, Iran, Syria, and Cuba.\n\n\"Adding Russia to the 'state sponsors of terrorism' list would be the nuclear economic option,\" Jason Blazakis, a former State Department official and expert on terrorism designations, wrote in a recent essay.\n\nAriel Cohen, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council Eurasia Center said that the idea Russia's actions fit the criteria for designating Russia a sponsor of terrorism is \"not without merit,\" but added the caveat that \"the question is, economically, what are the implications?\"\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken, when asked at a news conference last month if the U.S. would support such a move, said: \"Our focus first and foremost is on doing everything we can to help bring this war to a quick end, and to stop the suffering of the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nDespite describing Russia's attack on the shopping center in Kremenchuk, central Ukraine, as a \"war crime\", French President Emmanuel Macron today refused to label Russia a state sponsor of terrorism, saying \"we don't need any qualification whatsoever to carry these sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.\"\n\nSpeaking at the end of the G7 summit, Macron added: \"I really hope that the end [of the conflict] can be achieved by the end of the year, with a certainty and a desire, which is that Russia cannot and must not win.\"\n\nMeanwhile, at a joint press conference with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on June 27, NATO General Jens Stoltenberg announced that they would adopt a new comprehensive assistance package to Ukraine. \"We will agree a Comprehensive Assistance Package to Ukraine to help them uphold the right to self-defense\" he said. \"It is extremely important that we are ready to continue to provide support because Ukraine now faces brutality which we haven't seen in Europe since the Second World War.\"\n\nStoltenberg also said that the NATO summit would see world leaders \"agreeing a new Strategic Concept - the Madrid Strategic Concept - as a blueprint for NATO in a more dangerous and unpredictable world.\"\n\n\"We will agree a fundamental shift of our deterrence and defense with more high readiness forces, with more forward defense, with more pre-positioned equipment,\" he added. \"Then we hope to make progress on the accession of Finland and Sweden. And then, of course, we will also state that to be able to defend in a more dangerous world, we also need to invest more in our defenses.\"\n\nWith the summit taking place today in Madrid, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky posted on Twitter this afternoon:\n\n\"Had a phone conversation with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.

Lysychansk is the last major area of the province under Ukrainian control following the retreat of Ukraine's fighters from the neighboring city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nRussian troops and their separatist allies control 95% of Luhansk and hold about half of Donetsk region, the other province that makes up the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Authorities in the city declared three days of mourning.\n\nThe blast from Tuesday's airstrike was so powerful, relatives may not be able to recover any trace of their loved ones' remains.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Services press officer Svitlana Rybalko told The Associated Press that along with the 18 people killed, investigators found fragments of eight more bodies. It was not immediately clear if the body parts meant there were more victims. A number of survivors were being treated for injuries such as skull fractures and severed limbs.\n\n\"The police cannot say for sure how many (victims) there are. So we are finding not the bodies but the fragments of bodies,\" Rybalko said. \"Now we are clearing at the very epicenter of the blast. Here, we practically cannot find bodies as such.\"\n\nSeveral families stood by what was left of the Amstor shopping center Wednesday morning in hopes of finding missing loved ones. One young woman sat cross-legged on the ground weeping behind dark sunglasses,.\n\n\"This is pure genocide,\" local resident Tatiana Chernyshova said while going to lay flowers at the site. \"Such things cannot happen in the 21st century. Peaceful people suffer.\"\n\n\"We need to engage everyone to help stop the war, help us fight these scum - these Russian aggressors,\" Chernyshova said. \"It needs to be stopped by any means possible.\"\n\nPsychologists working at the site with families told the AP they were trying to help people come to terms with their loss.\n\n\"We are trying to help them release their emotions now, as later it becomes harder and much more painful,\" said one psychologist, who did not give his name as he was not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nAfter the attack on the mall, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of becoming \"a terrorist\" state carrying out \"daily terrorist acts.\" On Wednesday, he reproached NATO for not embracing or equipping his embattled country more fully.\n\n\"The open-door policy of NATO shouldn't resemble old turnstiles on Kyiv's subway, which stay open but close when you approach them until you pay,\" Zelenskyy told NATO leaders meeting in Madrid, speaking by video link. \"Hasn't Ukraine paid enough? Hasn't our contribution to defending Europe and the entire civilization been sufficient?\"\n\nHe asked for more modern artillery systems and other weapons and warned the leaders they either had to provide Ukraine with the help it needed to defeat Russia or \"face a delayed war between Russia and yourself.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Wednesday dismissed what she claimed was the Ukrainian government's \"blatant provocation\" in trying to blame the mall missile strike on Russia's military.\n\n\"All these fakes, unfortunately, were replicated and distributed,\" Zakharova said.\n\nBritain's Defense Ministry said there was a \"realistic possibility\" the missile strike on the shopping center \"was intended to hit a nearby infrastructure target.\"\n\n\"Russian planners highly likely remain willing to accept a high level of collateral damage when they perceive military necessity in striking a target,\" the ministry said. \"It is almost certain that Russian will continue to conduct strikes in an effort to interdict the resupplying of Ukrainian front-line forces.\"\n\nRussia's military also is experiencing a shortage of \"more modern precision strike weapons\" that together with \"the professional shortcomings of their targeting planners\" is compounding civilian casualties, the British ministry said.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, a Russian missile strike in the city of Mykolaiv killed at least four people and injured five after a missile hit a multi-story apartment building Wednesday, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said.\n\nMykolaiv is a major port in Ukraine's south and seizing it - as well as Odesa further west - would be key to Russia's objection of cutting off Ukraine from its Black Sea coast.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said in a statement that the missile strike on Mykolaiv targeted a base for training \"foreign mercenaries,\" as well as ammunition depots.\n\nRussian forces have been regularly pummeling Ukrainian weapons and munitions depots, oil storages and other facilities across Ukraine.\n\nVitali Klitschko, the mayor of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, urged the NATO leaders in Madrid to do whatever it took to stop the war, saying that if Ukraine is defeated, \"you're going to be next.\"\n\n\"If it's not going to be stopped now, all of us are going to be affected. The free world, the so-called free world is going to be affected. And NATO and the world society needs to learn how to act fast,\" Klitschko said.\n\nSeparately, European Union leaders approved Wednesday a 600-million euro ($631 million) package to address food security issues brought on by the Ukraine war. The money, from European Development Fund reserves, will be earmarked for African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.\n\nBritain is imposing sanctions on Russia's second-richest man and a cousin of President Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Potanin, owner of the Interross conglomerate, has continued to amass wealth while backing Putin, acquiring Rosbank and shares in Tinkoff Bankonith in the period following the invasion of Ukraine, a U.K. government statement said Wednesday\n\nThe statement said Putin's cousin, Anna Tsivileva, and her husband, Sergey Tsivilev, have \"significantly benefited\" from their relationship with Putin. Tsivileva is president of the JSC Kolmar Group coal mining company, and Tsivilev is governor of the coal-rich Kemerovo region.\n\nKarmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

Lysychansk is the last major area of the province under Ukrainian control following the retreat of Ukraine's fighters from the neighboring city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nRussian troops and their separatist allies control 95% of Luhansk and hold about half of Donetsk region, the other province that makes up the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Authorities in the city declared three days of mourning.\n\nThe blast from Tuesday's airstrike was so powerful, relatives may not be able to recover any trace of their loved ones' remains.\n\nUkrainian State Emergency Services press officer Svitlana Rybalko told The Associated Press that along with the 18 people killed, investigators found fragments of eight more bodies. It was not immediately clear if the body parts meant there were more victims. A number of survivors were being treated for injuries such as skull fractures and severed limbs.\n\n\"The police cannot say for sure how many (victims) there are. So we are finding not the bodies but the fragments of bodies,\" Rybalko said. \"Now we are clearing at the very epicenter of the blast. Here, we practically cannot find bodies as such.\"\n\nSeveral families stood by what was left of the Amstor shopping center Wednesday morning in hopes of finding missing loved ones. One young woman sat cross-legged on the ground weeping behind dark sunglasses,.\n\n\"This is pure genocide,\" local resident Tatiana Chernyshova said while going to lay flowers at the site. \"Such things cannot happen in the 21st century.

Hasn't our contribution to defending Europe and the entire civilization been sufficient?\"\n\nHe asked for more modern artillery systems and other weapons and warned the leaders they either had to provide Ukraine with the help it needed to defeat Russia or \"face a delayed war between Russia and yourself.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Wednesday dismissed what she claimed was the Ukrainian government's \"blatant provocation\" in trying to blame the mall missile strike on Russia's military.\n\n\"All these fakes, unfortunately, were replicated and distributed,\" Zakharova said.\n\nBritain's Defense Ministry said there was a \"realistic possibility\" the missile strike on the shopping center \"was intended to hit a nearby infrastructure target.\"\n\n\"Russian planners highly likely remain willing to accept a high level of collateral damage when they perceive military necessity in striking a target,\" the ministry said. \"It is almost certain that Russian will continue to conduct strikes in an effort to interdict the resupplying of Ukrainian front-line forces.\"\n\nRussia's military also is experiencing a shortage of \"more modern precision strike weapons\" that together with \"the professional shortcomings of their targeting planners\" is compounding civilian casualties, the British ministry said.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, a Russian missile strike in the city of Mykolaiv killed at least four people and injured five after a missile hit a multi-story apartment building Wednesday, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said.\n\nMykolaiv is a major port in Ukraine's south and seizing it - as well as Odesa further west - would be key to Russia's objection of cutting off Ukraine from its Black Sea coast.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said in a statement that the missile strike on Mykolaiv targeted a base for training \"foreign mercenaries,\" as well as ammunition depots.\n\nRussian forces have been regularly pummeling Ukrainian weapons and munitions depots, oil storages and other facilities across Ukraine.\n\nVitali Klitschko, the mayor of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, urged the NATO leaders in Madrid to do whatever it took to stop the war, saying that if Ukraine is defeated, \"you're going to be next.\"\n\n\"If it's not going to be stopped now, all of us are going to be affected. The free world, the so-called free world is going to be affected. And NATO and the world society needs to learn how to act fast,\" Klitschko said.\n\nSeparately, European Union leaders approved Wednesday a 600-million euro ($631 million) package to address food security issues brought on by the Ukraine war. The money, from European Development Fund reserves, will be earmarked for African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.\n\nBritain is imposing sanctions on Russia's second-richest man and a cousin of President Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Potanin, owner of the Interross conglomerate, has continued to amass wealth while backing Putin, acquiring Rosbank and shares in Tinkoff Bankonith in the period following the invasion of Ukraine, a U.K. government statement said Wednesday\n\nThe statement said Putin's cousin, Anna Tsivileva, and her husband, Sergey Tsivilev, have \"significantly benefited\" from their relationship with Putin.

The attack killed at least 18 civilians, according to local authorities, and wounded dozens of others, Human Rights Watch said today. On June 29, 36 people remained missing, as rescue efforts continued.\n\nA Russian Defense Ministry official claimed that the shopping center had been closed at the time of the attack. He also claimed that the fire that damaged the shopping center had spread from the detonation of Western-supplied munitions caused by Russian forces' strike in an industrial complex adjacent to the shopping center. Both claims are demonstrably false.\n\n\"The Russian missile that directly hit an open and busy civilian shopping center on June 27 caused devastating loss of civilian life,\" said Yulia Gorbunova, senior Ukraine researcher at Human Rights Watch. \"The incident should be investigated as a potential war crime, and if the Russian authorities don't, the International Criminal Court and other investigative bodies should.\"\n\nThe missile hit the shopping center at 4 p.m., destroying it and damaging several vehicles in its parking area. A second missile, minutes later, hit the north side of the Kremenchuk Road Vehicle Factory, a large industrial complex whose boundaries are less than 40 meters behind the shopping center, separated by a cement-block wall. The second strike hit 450 meters north of the first, leaving a crater approximately 16 meters wide and 5 meters deep. Four CCTV cameras recording different angles over a nearby park, captured the impact of the second missile. The CCTV time stamps show the second missile struck at 3:59 p.m. In one CCTV video, the smoke plume from the shopping center strike is visible. A Russian Defense Ministry official claimed that Ukrainian authorities stored weapons from the United States and European countries in the industrial complex. Ukraine's interior minister said there were no military targets within five kilometers of the shopping center.\n\nBased on site investigations on June 28 and 29, Human Rights Watch could not identify any evidence to indicate the industrial complex was storing munitions.\n\nContrary to Russian claims, although some of the shops closed after February 24, the shopping center remained open, witnesses, staff and shoppers said. Human Rights Watch spoke with 15 people, including people hospitalized with injuries, doctors, shop staff, other witnesses, and local officials.\n\nFour people separately said that around 4 p.m., they heard two explosions minutes apart. Elena Guseva, 55, who works at a grocery kiosk opposite the shopping center, said she heard the air raid siren around 4 p.m., \"prayed for it to be a false alarm\", went outside, and then heard a very loud explosion: \"I screamed and jumped. I felt sudden pain in my chest and stomach. And saw huge black smoke over the shopping mall.\"\n\nFootage, recorded from a CCTV camera overlooking the industrial complex behind the shopping center, captured the moment the first missile hit the shopping center. The footage's timestamp displays 3:51:54 p.m. An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy publicly shared the footage, whose exact location was first geolocated by the investigative journalism group Bellingcat and verified by Human Rights Watch by matching landmarks in the video with satellite imagery.\n\nHuman Rights Watch cannot at this time verify or disprove whether the industrial site was ever used for military purposes. However, Human Rights Watch observed its perimeter, and factory management granted researchers access to the complex. The factory's deputy director, Viktor Shybko, said that the factory did not house any military vehicles, equipment, or personnel and only produced machinery for concrete and asphalt production.\n\nResearchers were allowed unhindered access to the facility, including multiple warehouses, where they saw large, stationary machinery and old metal parts, some covered in dust. They found no evidence of military vehicles, weapons, or munitions. Since Russia's February invasion, the factory operated only part time due to disrupted supply lines. On June 27, the workday ended at 3:30 p.m., and about 50 personnel remained when the missile hit. The site's security staff is not militarized and are equipped only with radio and flashlights.\n\nKremenchuk's deputy mayor, Olha Usanova, and Oksana Korlyakova, head of the intensive care clinic, Kremenchutskaya, said that only 5 of the 18 killed had been identified because the other bodies were so badly burned as to make visual identification impossible. After the attack, 57 people sought medical assistance at the clinic, 25 of whom - 15 men and 10 women - required hospitalization. One of them died shortly after arrival and five were in grave condition on June 28.\n\nThe officials said that most people hospitalized had traumatic brain injuries and other injuries caused by primary and secondary blast fragmentation. Medics sent one person with severe burn injuries to a specialized hospital.\n\nA man hospitalized with head trauma and other injuries said he had been in the shopping center, lost consciousness, and woke up under a concrete slab. He said that he heard his wife, 43, screaming nearby. She was also trapped under concrete debris with her arm broken in three places: \"As we were stumbling out [of the mall], she had to hold her arm with her other arm, and we could see the bone protruding under the skin.\"\n\nMykolay, 39, who worked for 10 years as a consultant at an electronic store in the center, was also hospitalized. He said he heard an explosion followed by a \"deafening crushing noise.\" He remembered only being led outside by his colleagues, some of them injured and bleeding: \"A part of the wall was completely gone, and we just walked through the opening to get outside.\"\n\nPetro, 41, an employee with another electronics store, had been sitting outside the center with a co-worker, Oleksandr, waiting for the air raid siren to end: \"I saw a yellow flash in front of my eyes, and a wave threw me several meters, hitting wooden pallets before losing consciousness.\" When Petro regained consciousness, he realized he had multiple cuts and blood gushing from his right arm. He was hospitalized with a concussion and multiple bruises on his back and head. His hand was visibly swollen and his back covered in bruises. His co-worker was hospitalized with leg fractures.\n\nAn IT expert who was a kilometer from the shopping center when the strike hit went to the center when he heard the explosion. He saw numerous emergency vehicles, and people being carried out with blood on their arms and head. He said there was a lot of smoke and the smell of burning plastic was so overpowering that he could not breathe and had to leave after about 20 minutes.\n\nRescue workers continue to comb the site for survivors. Human Rights Watch spoke with a family who said they called the morgue and every hospital in the city looking for their daughter, an employee at the shopping center, to no avail.\n\nHuman Rights Watch analyzed satellite imagery collected before and after the attack. A low-resolution image taken on June 27 at 11:18 a.m. shows no damage to the shopping center or factory. A high-resolution satellite image the following morning confirms that the attack hit at least two distinct areas, reducing the shopping center to rubble and severely affecting the surrounding areas. Several cars were destroyed and a section of the wall that surrounds the neighboring factory was damaged. Debris is spread in various directions.\n\nThe crater at the industrial complex was caused by the second strike. It hit the complex's largest production warehouse and the greenhouse next to it. The satellite image shows the crater and damage to several surrounding buildings. The roof and northern fa\u00e7ade of one of the buildings are severely damaged, and six buildings are destroyed.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force command identified the weapons used by Russia in the strikes as KH-22 (X-22 in Cyrilic) cruise missiles, fired from Russian aircraft. At the shopping center site, Ukrainian authorities presented remnants they said had been recovered from the strike. Human Rights Watch has not independently verified the weapons used in either strike. The impact crater in the factory and the blast damage to the shopping center are consistent with the detonation of warheads weighing nearly 1,000 kilograms with large high-explosive payloads.\n\nIf Russian forces were targeting the industrial complex, they had to or should have been aware of the large presence of civilians adjacent to their intended target. They had an obligation to distinguish those civilians and the civilian shopping center from any potential military objective, and to take all feasible precautions to minimize incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects.\n\nThis includes not conducting a strike where the foreseeable risk of civilian causalities and harm to civilian objects clearly exceeds any concrete military advantage anticipated. Intentionally launching an attack where the loss of life or injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated is a war crime.\n\nThe use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas heightens concerns of unlawful, indiscriminate, and disproportionate attacks. These weapons can have a large destructive radius, are inherently inaccurate, or deliver multiple munitions simultaneously. This includes munitions with large, high-explosive warheads, as used in the June 27 attack. The use of these weapons should be avoided in populated areas.\n\n\"The civilians in Kremenchuk who suffered such intense loss from the June 27 strike deserve justice,\" Gorbunova said. \"There needs to be a thorough investigation, and those responsible should be held to account.\"", "source": {"uri": "hrw.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Human Rights Watch"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2022/06/202206eca_ukraine_kremenchuk_exterior.JPG?h=71976bb4&itok=HIikexsP", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 37, "stanza_neu": 41, "stanza_pos": 6, "swn_neg": 84, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7095192264", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-28", "time": "17:26:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-28T17:26:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-28T17:05:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4196078479290009, "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-61972937", "title": "CCTV shows moment civilians flee missile strikes", "body": "CCTV footage from a pond in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk has captured civilians running for cover and falling to the ground as Russian missile strikes hit nearby, leaving at least 18 people dead.\n\nThe BBC has analysed the footage - and it appears one missile hit close to the eastern end of a shopping centre, while the other hit the northern end of a nearby factory.\n\nRussia claims a strike on an arms storage facility detonated ammunition which set the nearby mall on fire.\n\nUkrainian officials have denied there was a weapons depot nearby.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0134/production/_125680300_p0chnc2t.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 1, "stanza_neu": 3, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 4, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093691698", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "15:19:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T15:19:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T15:19:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4196078479290009, "url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russia-strikes-ukrainian-shopping-centre-with-1-000-inside-2sxb9qks0", "title": "Russia strikes Ukrainian shopping centre with 1,000 inside", "body": "Russian missiles have struck a shopping centre in central Ukraine with more than a thousand people inside, moments after the White House announced that it was sending Kyiv a sophisticated air defence system.\n\nPresident Zelensky confirmed the strike on the shopping centre in Kremenchuk, warning: \"It is impossible to even imagine the number of victims.\" Video showed a fire raging through the complex.\n\nAt least two people are dead and 20 injured, Zelensky's office said, with that number expected to rise.

When you thought that you had used all of the adjectives possible to describe the horror and unspeakable atrocities by Russia in Ukraine, then along comes an even worse example of the genocide of Ukrainians by the Russian Army and confirmation of Putin's chosen course of pure terrorism to destroy Ukraine.\n\nAccording to preliminary estimates, at the time of the missile hit, there were many people in the trading building. Possibly up to 1000 people. Rescue operations are under way, the number of victims and injured are being counted.\n\nRussia is raising its profile as the world's leading international terrorist state and bombarding Ukrainian cities with obsolete missiles which have poor accuracy thereby causing mass destruction and civilian casualties. The Russian army uses missiles developed in the 1950s and is using up all of its stockpiled weapons from storage in order to wreak terror on the Ukrainians.\n\nOn June 26 at 06:00 am, Russia also launched a missile attack on a kindergarten in Kyiv. Fortunately, in the morning the site and the building were empty. This is a further example of Russia using outdated and inaccurate missiles against Ukraine, but with tremendous destructive power.\n\nShortly after the attack on Kremenchuk, Russian news portals, in order to conceal this latest crime of the Russian army, began to pump out propaganda about the \"next fake\" that the Ukrainians were producing to slander Russia. The cynicism of the invaders has reached such a level that they claim that \"the role of the corpses was played by the same actors who were involved in the depiction of the slaughter in Bucha.\" The world must see and realise the cynicism and cruelty of the Russians - a nation of international terrorists and murderers.\n\nRussian cynicism has hit rock bottom. When the Kremlin was talking about the possibility of \"strike at the decision-making centres\", no one could have thought that these \"centres\" were located in shopping centres and kindergartens.\n\nUkraine needs as many weapons as possible - artillery, MLRS, air defence to protect its cities and airspace. Otherwise, Putin, obsessed with a maniacal desire to kill Ukrainians, will give orders to repeat such brutal terrorist acts.\n\nBecause of Russia no one in any city of Ukraine can feel completely safe. This is unthinkable in the 21st century and requires a symmetrical response from the international community.\n\nThe strike inflicted by the Russians on the shopping centre in Kremenchuk affected civilians in the building. It seems that Putin's goal is the total genocide of Ukrainians, and that he will employ pure unadulterated terrorism to achieve his objectives.\n\nJune 27 will be a day of mourning for this act of blatant cruelty and the pathological hatred of Russians for Ukrainians.\n\nThe Russians will deny their involvement in the attack on Kremenchuk, laying the blame on Ukraine, publishing a stream of lies and imaginary \"witnesses\". But they cannot mislead the entire civilised world, which is keenly aware of the depth of the Ukrainian tragedy.\n\nAngry with the failures of his armed forces at the front, Putin has deliberately given the order to inflict maximum losses on Ukraine - economic, resources, demographics and civilian infrastructure.\n\nThe world must recognise that the Russian Federation has now become the world's most dangerous terrorist organisation, and it must impose the most severe and uncompromising sanctions on Russia in order to weaken it as much as possible. Otherwise, in the nearest future, the terrorist atrocities that Russians have committed in Bucha and Kremenchuk will spread to other European cities.", "source": {"uri": "eupoliticalreport.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "eupoliticalreport.eu"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.eupoliticalreport.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-71.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 5, "stanza_neu": 22, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 27, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7098276936", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-30", "time": "23:13:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-30T23:13:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-30T23:09:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4156862795352936, "url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/jun/30/facebook-posts/no-moscow-was-not-targeted-missile-attack/", "title": "PolitiFact - No, Moscow was not targeted in a missile attack", "body": "Footage used in a social media video claiming to be from the attack was taken from unrelated incidents.\n\nA video on social media uses footage of burning buildings and people fleeing for cover to claim there was a missile attack against Moscow, Russia.\n\n\"Kremlin electricity is under attack,\" a caption for the June 28 Facebook video says. \"Putin panics when Moscow is blown up by two rockets turned Moscow into a sea of fire.\"\n\nA narration with the video claims the attack happened June 27 and resulted in a large number of casualties.

According to the latest reports, the attack killed up to 20 people and injured 59 others; at least 21 people are still missing. Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky said on Wednesday that rescue workers are still recovering body parts from the wreckage, but there is no longer any hope of finding survivors. Journalist Shura Burtin, who is reporting for Meduza from Ukraine, traveled to Kremenchuk on Monday to cover the immediate aftermath of the strike. Here's what he saw.\n\nI arrived at the Amstor shopping center in Kremenchuk at around seven o'clock in the evening (Editor's note: the missile strike occurred at around 3:50 p.m. Kyiv time). The building was still on fire -- a gigantic, frightening blaze. Absolutely everything was covered in smoke.\n\nAt that point, people still hadn't taken it in. The shopping center was on fire and, at the same time, a man walked by with a kid on his shoulders, there were young people with beers. People were just looking at the smoke. Volunteers came from the surrounding buildings and helped the firefighters pull bodies from the stores that had already been doused in water.\n\nI walked among the firefighters and police officers. Ambulances were still leaving the scene. Someone had been pulled out [from under the rubble], so the ambulances were perhaps carrying not only the wounded, but also the dead.\n\nIt was mostly the firefighters who pulled people out. They put out the flames, wet [everything] down with water, cut and sawed through metal structures, and extracted the bodies of the dead -- or what was left of them.\n\n[On Tuesday, June 28], I went to the police station, where I found a frazzled investigator. Apparently, she had spent the evening conducting interviews [with witnesses and relatives of the victims]. The police officers hadn't slept all night.\n\n[The investigator said] that at the time [of the missile strike], there were roughly 300 people inside the shopping center: around 50 were injured and about 40 people were missing. There are at least 20 dead -- including one man who died in intensive care [on Tuesday].\n\nYesterday, I asked the doctors at the mall where the injured were being taken. They listed several hospitals. They were mainly taken to City Hospital #3 and the regional burn center.\n\nI went to Hospital #3 -- it's a 10 minute drive from the Amstor shopping center. A crowd of relatives had gathered, about 50 people. They didn't know whether their loved ones were there or among the dead. At first, the relatives stood outside the hospital. Then, at around eight o'clock in the evening, they were allowed inside. I went with them.\n\nIt was an ordinary, impoverished hospital. People were scattered around the wards. Someone ran over to the intensive care unit. A doctor came out of the ICU and appeared to say something, but the relatives weren't allowed inside. They just said \"stable condition\" or \"serious.\" Because people [at the mall] didn't have their documents with them, there were only four or five people whose names [the doctors] knew. No one knew anything about the rest.\n\nSeveral of the wounded were in the surgical unit, they were stitched up right in the wards, because the ICU was full. Relatives crowded around these rooms, trying to get a look [inside]. In two of the wards, I saw five wounded people. Most of the injured were in intensive care.\n\nOne man I spoke to [at the hospital] had left the mall to go out for a smoke just as everything exploded. He was hit by shards of glass.\n\nA couple more people, who worked at [the electronics store] Comfy, went down to the shelter when the air raid siren went off. Five minutes later, after the explosion happened, they left [the shelter] and tried to run back into [the mall] to get someone else out. But there was already a wall of fire, it was impossible to get inside.\n\nAnother injured woman had her whole face cut up [by shards of glass] and had to be sewn up. She and her husband were exiting a store when the explosion happened. She hardly remembers anything after that, aside from how she went flying and got hit by debris. Both she and her husband lost consciousness and the woman was trapped under a slab.\n\nThen, either the pipes burst or the fire alarm system went off -- the water woke them up, and the husband managed to pry the slab off of his wife with the help of some kind of lever. The slab turned out to be a wall that had collapsed. They were able to crawl out through this gap.\n\nThe relatives [of the victims] were completely beside themselves. They were standing near the hospital, not knowing if their sons or daughters were there, if they were alive or not, if they were in intensive care or dead. Talking to them was dreadful, they couldn't get the words out.\n\nThese people were experiencing terrible grief. They already realized that their daughter had died, they knew it deep down, but they still clung to some illusory hope. They sat [in the emergency room] and, from time to time, began to cry.\n\nEveryone had the exact same story. In the morning, [their loved ones] left for work, then they [the relatives] heard the blast. They tried calling but couldn't get through; they ran to the hospital or to the mall. Those who couldn't locate [their relatives] or find out anything about [what had happened to] them went to the police. DNA samples were taken from all of these people, because the bodies are unrecognizable.\n\nAmid the grief, I never heard anyone say a word about Russia or the war. There was a sense of numb disbelief. This situation was beyond all reason and no one could comment on it. This is the kind of atrocity that people don't talk about -- there's nothing to say. You realize that it's impossible to ask them anything, they're in a daze.\n\nKremenchuk looks a lot like your average Russian city -- a regional center like Kursk or Voronezh. The people speak Russian and dress the exact same way: men, women, and teenagers in shorts...Some of those [near the hospital] had their children with them.\n\nThis morning there was no longer a crowd outside the hospital, but the police were working inside. They were making lists [of the dead and wounded] and talking with their relatives. By now all of the relatives know who is [in which unit]. They're crowded around the intensive care unit and waiting for the doctor to come out and tell them something [about their loved ones]. They're in very serious condition.\n\nOthers are sitting in the wards -- they're much calmer, because their relatives are no longer in critical condition.\n\nThere's a military cordon around the shopping center, ordinary Ukrainian soldiers with automatics. Today, there's a huge number of reporters gathered here: Ukraine's Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova arrived, along with officials from the Interior Ministry, and a military helicopter flew in some journalists from Kyiv. There's a New York Times correspondent and some TV crews. Yesterday, I was the only one here.\n\nThe firefighters said that they hadn't \"dug down\" to the biggest fallen slab. They're obviously expecting to find some of the missing underneath it.\n\nUpdate. Two emergency workers were injured while dismantling the rubble at the Kremenchuk shopping mall on Wednesday after a concrete slab shifted, Ukraine's State Emergency Service reported. Also on Wednesday, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky confirmed 18 deaths, adding that rescue workers are still retrieving \"fragments of bodies\" from the wreckage, the Kyiv Independent reported. According to Monastyrsky, 21 people are still missing, but there is no longer any hope of finding survivors.\n\nToday, I climbed into the shopping center. The building's frame, the iron trusses, were twisted by the explosion and everything collapsed. There's a very strong smell -- in some spots it's unbearable.\n\nRight now, I'm at a caf\u00e9 in the center of Kremenchuk. In town, I haven't heard [any] discussions [about the Russian missile strike]. On the contrary, it's surprising that all of the snatches of conversation I've heard in passing have nothing to do with it.\n\nKremenchuk has been shelled more than once; there are regular air raid sirens here. People very quickly got used to them and stopped reacting. I was actually surprised that any of the shopping mall's employees made their way to the bomb shelter. There was an air raid alert just now and no one reacted to it either.\n\nIn town today I saw a guy carrying carnations. I asked him: did someone pass away? He said no, he had just decided to bring flowers to the shopping mall.\n\nThere's a feeling of catastrophe. I left the hospital [yesterday] with a completely glazed look. This morning, I walked around and around -- and then sat and stared at one point. This has never happened to me before. Everyone here feels that a terrible atrocity was committed.\n\nMy [Ukrainian] friend who came here with me expressed the feeling best. He's not one for patriotic rhetoric, but when we got here he was struck by what he saw -- he was stunned. He looked at [the burning mall] and, with difficulty, forced out a few words: \"Yes, your compatriots are real terrorists.\"", "source": {"uri": "meduza.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "Meduza"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://meduza.io/imgly/share/1656526602/en/feature/2022/06/29/your-compatriots-are-real-terrorists", "eventUri": "eng-7815600", "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 105, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 39, "stanza_neu": 70, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 110, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7096061099", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-29", "time": "10:27:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-29T10:27:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-29T10:16:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4117647111415863, "url": "https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/moment-ukraine-shopping-centre-obliterated-27354093", "title": "Moment Ukraine shopping centre obliterated by Russian missile in CCTV footage", "body": "Vladimir Putin's latest attack on innocent people in Ukraine was caught on CCTV as a missile was seen flying through the air before obliterating a shopping centre\n\nCCTV footage has captured the horrifying moment a Russian missile obliterated a shopping centre in Ukraine, killing at least 20 people.\n\nDozens have also been left injured and several are still missing in the wreckage of the building in the city of Kremenchuk, which came under attack on Monday (June 27).\n\nThe chilling footage of the incident shows the building engulfed in flames as debris is sent flying into the air, which is so intense that local fire chief Ivan Melekhovets, who has been taking part in the rescue operation, said anyone left inside had \"no chance of surviving\".\n\nREAD MORE: Putin mouthpiece accuses West of 'bloody provocations' after shopping centre attack\n\n\"The hardest thing is to see the corpses -
