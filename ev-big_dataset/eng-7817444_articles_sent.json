A second missile damaged the building of \"Kredmash\" PRJSC (a machine engineering plant), which only produced spare parts for civilian cars.\n\nAt least 20 people were killed and 59 were injured in a Russian missile strike at the Amstor shopping centre.\n\nYurii Ihnat, a spokesman for Ukrainian Air Force Command, said that the attack on Kremenchuk was carried out using an X-22 missile fired from a Tu-22M3 bomber from the Kursk area.\n\nRussian representatives initially claimed the missile had struck \"hangars with weapons and ammunition from the United States and European countries.\"\n\nLater the Russian Federation representatives claimed that the shopping centre was \"not operating,\" \"staged\", and that the video record of the first minutes after the shelling and the screams of blooded civilians was \"fake.\"\n\nIt is not the first time that Russia has tried to disown and deny their \"announced\" strikes after civilian targets have been hit. This was particularly the case with the missile attack on the train station in Kramatorsk.\n\nPresident of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy later shared a video that clearly shows the Russian missile hitting the shopping centre.\n\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine has already identified the Russian pilots who launched rockets at the shopping centre in Kremenchuk.

The bombers took off from airbase \"Shaykovka\" in Kaluga Oblast, the launches were carried out from Kursk Oblast, reported Air Force Command of UA Armed Forces.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said Russia attacked \"hangars with weapons and ammunition from the US and European countries near the Kremenchuk Plant of road machines\" and that a fire in the mall was allegedly caused by the detonation of ammunition from the hangar. In addition, Russia claims that the shopping center \"did not function.\"\n\nDuring the attack on June 27, Kremenchuk Plant of Road Machines (\"Kredmash\") was also hit, but it produces asphalt mixing systems and spare parts to it.\n\nThe plant was opened in 1870 and produced horse engines, threshing machines, chaff cutters, and spare parts for them. In 1930, the company switched to the production of road machines. In August 1941, the plant was evacuated to the city of Kurgan, where the Kurgan Road Machinery Plant was established on its basis. It produced gas stations, gas containers, flamethrowers, parts for artillery systems, and other products.\n\nSince 1991, the plant didn't produce military equipment and spare parts, says Chairman of the Management Board of the Plant Mykola Danyleyko.", "source": {"uri": "en.hromadske.ua", "dataType": "news", "title": "en.hromadske.ua"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/hromadske-en/posts/image_socials/000/003/908/original/data?1656433014", "eventUri": "eng-7817444", "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 23, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 30, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7093739251", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-06-27", "time": "15:59:00", "dateTime": "2022-06-27T15:59:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-06-27T15:59:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5921568870544434, "url": "https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2022/06/27/7354972/", "title": "Russians fire missiles on crowded area in Kremenchuk, killing civilians", "body": "The Russians have launched missile strikes on a shopping centre in Kremenchuk, killing civilians.\n\nSource: Vitalii Maletskyi, the mayor of Kremenchuk; Dmytro Lunin, the head of Poltava Oblast Military Administration; Emine Dzhaparova, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs\n\nDetails: Firefighters, medics and police are working at the site of the missile strike.

Three minutes later, they were thrown to the ground, covered by the rubble of the front of their business, located opposite the Amstor shopping center in Kremenchuk, Ukraine.\n\nThe day after a Russian missile strike destroyed the shopping mall in the quiet town 300 kilometers southeast of Kiev, the couple observed the structure's charred remains alongside a group of firefighters who came to take a break and cool off in front of the building. \"Usually, the Amstor shopping mall managers would evacuate people when the sirens sounded,\" said Tatiana in her loud voice. \"But, in three minutes, it all happened too fast.\" \"We're in shock. We're in the 21 century and this is a nightmare,\" she exclaimed, gesturing towards the bombed out building. Several of the couple's acquaintances, who worked in one of the stores in the mall, aren't answering their phones.\n\nOn Tuesday, the residents of Kremenchuk gathered in front of the former shopping center and watched the firefighters working to clear the debris. The square, covered with tents, trucks and emergency vehicles, is guarded by armed men. Men continue to tear apart pieces of metal in the bombed out building in order to secure the area. In memory of the victims, an altar of flowers and candles has been set up nearby.\n\nAt a press briefing, the deputy head of the Ukranian president's office, Kirill Timoshenko, announced that the death toll from the Kremenchuk strike had risen to \"more than 20,\" with over 40 more still missing. Ukraine's Attorney General, Iryna Venediktova, who was present at the scene, also said that this attack joined the list of Russia's \"crimes against humanity.\" In the morning, investigators from the regional prosecutor's office began working with police to collect evidence of war crimes.\n\nEveryone knew the shopping center. Among the rapt observers, Ruslana, Alyona and Daria, three nicely dressed young women, looked at the bombed out building without saying a word. \"Unfortunately, our friend's father works there,\" said Ruslana, a dance teacher. \"He's missing. Maybe he's under the ruins, we don't know, and nothing has been confirmed yet.\" The shock is all the greater because the city, which is located 200 kilometers from the battle front, had not been too hard hit until now. Before this, in April, Russian missiles hit an oil refinery and a power plant on the outskirts of Kremenchuk, killing one and wounding fourteen.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://img.lemde.fr/2022/06/29/888/0/5588/2794/1440/720/60/0/122a7d1_1656485886817-raf-009a.JPG", "eventUri": "eng-7817444", "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 6, "stanza_neu": 16, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 23, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}]
