'Insane War,' 'Barbaric Attacks' in Ukraine", "body": "ROME -- Pope Francis has once again condemned the Russian war on \"dear and tormented\" Ukraine, calling for prayers and aid for the besieged nation.\n\n\"Every day I carry in my heart the dear and tormented Ukraine, which continues to be scourged by barbaric attacks, like the one that struck the Kremenchuk shopping centre,\" the pontiff said after his Angelus prayer in the Vatican Wednesday.\n\n\"I pray that this insane war may soon see an end, and I renew the invitation to persevere, without tiring, in prayer for peace: may the Lord open those paths of dialogue that men are unwilling or unable to find!\" he said.\n\n\"And let us not neglect to come to the aid of the Ukrainian people, who are suffering so much,\" Francis concluded.\n\nThe pope was referring to Tuesday's Russian missile strike on a crowded mall in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk, which claimed the lives of at least 16 civilians.\n\n\"The Russian strike today on the shopping centre in Kremenchuk is one of the most brazen terrorist acts in European history,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said following the attack.\n\nPope Francis has been criticized for his unwillingness to call out Russian aggression by name, and for his refusal to acknowledge guilty and innocent parties in the conflict.\n\nIn an interview with the Jesuit journal La Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica published earlier this month, the pope said there were no \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\" in the war and suggested that a number of factors, including \"barking\" by NATO and the international arms trade, had provoked Russia's aggression.\n\nThe pope said he is \"against reducing complexity to the distinction between good guys and bad guys without reasoning about roots and interests, which are very complex.\"\n\n\"What is before our eyes is a situation of world war, global interests, arms sales and geopolitical appropriation, which is martyring a heroic people,\" he asserted.\n\nIn a pointed response, Ukrainian Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk asserted that Russia had not been \"provoked\" into invading Ukraine and that the causes of the war \"lie within Russia itself.\"\n\n\"We see and know, experiencing here in Ukraine, that Russia's aggression against Ukraine is completely unprovoked,\" the archbishop said. \"Anyone who thinks that some external cause has provoked Russia into military aggression is either themselves in the grip of Russian propaganda or is simply and deliberately deceiving the world.\"", "source": {"uri":

Of the 144 freed, 95 are Azovstal defenders,\" the intelligence directorate of Ukraine's Defense Ministry said on Telegram.\n\nPro-Russian separatist leader Denis Pushilin said 144 soldiers from Russia and the Donetsk People's Republic -- the name of the breakaway region recognized by Moscow -- had \"returned home\".\n\nHundreds of Ukrainians sheltered in the Azovstal steel plant during Moscow's bombardment of Mariupol, but they were taken into Russian custody after surrendering in mid-May.\n\nThree Belarusian activists \"could face the death penalty\" after being charged with carrying out railway sabotage in Belarus to impede Russian troops during the early stages of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Minsk investigators said Wednesday.\n\nThe men were accused of terrorism after being arrested on March 1 for setting fire to relay boxes on the railway network at night, the Belarusian Investigative Committee said on its website as it completed the three-month probe.\n\nMeanwhile, Pope Francis has condemned the bombing of a shopping mall in the city of Kremenchuk.\n\nUkraine said at least 18 people were killed and around 60 wounded in Monday's missile strike.\n\nMoscow's Defense Ministry said it had hit a legitimate military target, and that the mall was not in use.\n\n\"Every day, I carry in my heart dear and martyred Ukraine, which continues to be flagellated by barbarous attacks like the one that hit the shopping center in Kremenchuk,\" Pope Francis told those gathered St. Peter's Square.\n\n\"I pray that this mad war can soon end and I renew my appeal to persevere without tiring in praying for peace.\"\n\n\"May the Lord open the those paths to dialogue which men either do not want or not able to find.
