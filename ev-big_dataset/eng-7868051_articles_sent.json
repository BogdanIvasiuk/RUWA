\"Kalibr high-precision sea-based missiles attacked the building of the House of Officers in the city of Vinnitsa.\"\n\n\"At the time of the strike, a meeting was taking place in the facility between the command of the Ukrainian air force and representatives of foreign arms suppliers about the next batch of aircraft and weapons to the Ukrainian military, as well as organizing the repair of the Ukrainian aviation fleet.\"\n\nEveryone involved in the meeting was eliminated.\n\nOn Thursday, Russia's UN mission senior councilor, Yevgeny Varganov, said the following about the Vinnitsa strike.\n\nThroughout its SMO, \"Russia str(uk) only at military targets in Ukraine.\"\n\n\"The attack on Vinnitsa hit the House of Officers, which the armed forces of Ukraine used for training.\"\n\nYet once again, imperial tool UN secretary general Guterres turned reality on its head through his spokesman, as follows, saying:\n\nHe's \"appalled by today's missile attack against the city of Vinnitsa in central Ukraine that reportedly killed at least 22 people, including three children and wounded more than 100 others (sic).\"\n\nHe \"condemns any attacks against civilians or civilian infrastructure and reiterates his call for accountability for such violations (sic).\"\n\nFact: No Russian attack on civilians or nonmilitary infrastructure occurred at any time throughout its liberating SMO.\n\nFact: No Vinnitsa civilians were killed by Russian forces.\n\nFact: Yet in cahoots with his US master, he pretended otherwise by falsely and maliciously making phony accusations about Russia's Vinnitsa strike.\n\nIn response, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said the following:\n\n\"(C)ontrary to the requirements of the UN Charter, (Guterres) fail(ed) to take an equidistant stance, which is what one would expect from the UN) secretariat...particularly designed to help resolve disputes.\"\n\n\"(T)he UN secretariat('s) goal is not to take anyone's side in controversial situations but to facilitate efforts to maintain peace and stability.\"\n\n\"This is what they are paid for and what they are mandated to do.\"\n\nRussia's Vinnitsa strike \"targeted a garrison officers' club where consultations between the command of the Ukrainian air forces and representatives of foreign weapons suppliers were underway.\"\n\n\"Guterres (failed) to ask Ukraine why the Kiev regime keeps establishing military facilities in close proximity to civilian ones.\"\n\nWhile falsely accusing Russia of attacking civilians, he turned a blind eye to over 8 years of Kiev aggression on Donbass residential areas, killing around 14,000 civilians, along with destroying or damaging civilian infrastructure.\n\nLike most of his predecessors, imperial tool Guterres disgraces the office he holds time and again.\n\nMost everything claimed about Russia's SMO by US/Western regimes, Nazi-infested Ukraine, their MSM press agents and imperial tool Guterres have been bald-faced Big Lies.\n\nCollectively, their rubbish has been the most outrageous perversions of reality in modern memory.\n\nWith no end of it any time soon, they and the rogue regimes they represent risk unthinkable US/NATO aggression against Russia by accident or design.\n\nIf occurs, chances of hostilities going nuclear will be ominously high, an armageddon scenario if things turn out this way.\n\nSeparately in response to hegemon USA's delivery of multiple-launch rocket systems (HIMARS) to Ukrainian Nazis, Zakharova, said the following:\n\nThe US-controlled, Nazi-infested Kiev regime is \"us(ing) (them) against civilians\" -- with intent to kill, wound or maim maximum numbers of Donbass noncombatants in harm's way.\n\nAt the same time, the Pentagon and CIA are selecting civilian and other targets for Ukrainian Nazis to terror-shell, including with intent to kill or otherwise harm Donbass children.\n\nIn early July, Vladimir Putin said \"Russia and the Russian government, the country's leadership will do everything to help the people who live and work\" in Donbass.\n\nTake off the gloves. Strike all Ukrainian decision-making centers everywhere, including the regime's HQ in Kiev.\n\nEliminate them, including the regime's high command and US/Western officials operating in Ukraine with them.\n\nThen go all-out to smash the made-in-the-USA Ukrainian monster once and for all.\n\nTreat the empire of lies and its Western vassals with toughness -- the only language they understand.\n\nWhenever undertaken by Russia with the US-dominated West, betrayal follows every time.\n\nTheir regimes are not partners, their officials not colleagues.", "source": {"uri": "freedomsphoenix.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "freedomsphoenix.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_lendman@freedomsphoenix.com", "name": "Stephen Lendman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.FreedomsPhoenix.com/Uploads/Pix/533/07/533-0716063044.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7868051", "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 28, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 37, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7115586709", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-15", "time": "09:44:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-15T09:44:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-15T09:35:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7215686440467834, "url": "https://www.rt.com/russia/559038-russia-comments-airstrike-vinnitsa/", "title": "Russia comments on deadly strike on Ukrainian city  --  RT Russia & Former Soviet Union", "body": "The Russian military has confirmed launching a missile attack at a target in the city of Vinnitsa in Ukraine.
