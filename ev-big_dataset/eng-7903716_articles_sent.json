There was no characteristic whistling, and the explosions occurred on their own.\"\n\nIn addition, online video footage showed that the windows remained whole in some rooms of the facility, according to the SBU. That \"indicates that the epicenter of the explosion was inside the destroyed building, and its walls took the hit from the blast waves, protecting some of the neighboring rooms.\"\n\nA Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson, Lt.

Workers were seen preparing terminals for grain exports, which are relied on by millions of impoverished people worldwide. Zelenskyy said the shipments would begin with the departure of several vessels that were already loaded but could not leave when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\n-- The Ukrainian presidential office said at least 13 civilians were killed and another 36 wounded in Russian shelling over the last 24 hours. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, at least four people were killed and seven others wounded when Russian shelling hit a bus stop. The Russian barrage also hit a facility that distributed humanitarian aid where three people were wounded, officials said. Ukrainian officials also said at least four civilians were killed and five hurt in the eastern town of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region.\n\n-- An appeals court in Kyiv on Friday reduced to 15 years the life sentence of a Russian soldier convicted in the first war crimes trial since Russia invaded Ukraine. Critics had said the sentencing of Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was unduly harsh given that he confessed to the crime and expressed remorse. He pleaded guilty to killing a civilian and was convicted in May. His defense lawyer argued that Shishimarin shot a Ukrainian man on the orders of his superiors.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/rsz_ap22210514260494.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 18, "stanza_neu": 32, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 50, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7133117840", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "22:38:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T22:38:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T22:37:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.800000011920929, "url": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/kyiv-moscow-trade-blame-after-53-ukrainian-pows-killed-in-strike-on-prison/", "title": "Kyiv, Moscow trade blame after 53 Ukrainian POWs killed in strike on prison", "body": "AP -- Russia and Ukraine accused each other Friday of shelling a prison in a separatist region of eastern Ukraine, an attack that reportedly killed dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war captured after the fall of Mariupol, the city where troops famously held out against a monthslong Russian siege.\n\nBoth sides said the assault was premeditated with the aim of covering up atrocities.\n\nRussia claimed that Ukraine's military used US-supplied rocket launchers to strike the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic.

Their loss has raised global food prices, threatened political instability and helped push more people into poverty and hunger in already vulnerable countries.\n\nUkraine's military is committed to the ships' safety, said Zelenskyy, adding, \"It is important for us that Ukraine remains the guarantor of global food security.\"\n\nHis unannounced visit to the port is part of Ukraine's push to show the world that it is nearly ready to export millions of tons of grains under last week's breakthrough agreements, which were brokered by Turkey and the United Nations and signed separately by Ukraine and Russia.\n\nThe sides agreed to facilitate the shipment of wheat and other grains from three Ukrainian ports through safe corridors on the Black Sea, as well as fertilizer and food from Russia.\n\nBut a Russian missile strike on Odesa hours after signing the deal threw Moscow's commitment into question and raised concerns about the safety of shipping crews, who also have to navigate waters strewn with explosive mines.\n\nRussia's deputy U.N. ambassador Dmitry Polyansky told the U.N. Security Council in New York on Friday that Ukraine has been deploying military goods and hardware in the port of Odesa, \"and we will continue to destroy these goods and objects, as we did on July 23.\"\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov emphasized the \"link between taking grain out of Ukrainian ports and unblocking direct or indirect restrictions on the export of our grain, fertilizers and other goods to global markets.\"\n\nThe security concerns and complexities of the agreements have set off a slow, cautious start. The clock is ticking -- the deal is only good for 120 days.\n\nThe goal over the next four months is to export some 20 million tons of grain from three Ukrainian sea ports blocked since the Feb. 24 invasion. That provides time for four to five large bulk carriers per day to transport grain from the ports to millions of people in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, who are already facing food shortages and, in some cases, famine.\n\nGetting the grain out is also critical to farmers in Ukraine, who are running out of storage capacity because of a new harvest.\n\n\"We are ready,\" Ukraine's minister of infrastructure, Oleksandr Kubrakov, told reporters at the port of Odesa on Friday.\n\nBut he said Ukraine is waiting on the U.N. to confirm the safe corridors that ships will use. In the meantime, a ship at the port of Chornomorsk was being loaded with grain, he said.\n\nLloyd's List, a global shipping news publisher, noted that while U.N. officials are pushing for the initial voyage this week to show progress, uncertainty on key details will likely prevent an immediate ramping-up of shipments.\n\n\"Until those logistical issues and detailed outlines of safeguarding procedures are disseminated, charters will not be agreed and insurers will not be underwriting shipments,\" wrote Bridget Diakun and Richard Meade of Lloyd's List.\n\nThey note, however, that U.N. agencies, such as the World Food Program, have already arranged to charter much of the grain for urgent humanitarian needs.\n\nShipping companies have not rushed in because explosive mines are drifting in the waters, ship owners are assessing the risks and many question how the agreement will unfold.\n\nThe deal stipulates that Russia and Ukraine provide \"maximum assurances\" for ships that brave the journey to the Ukrainian ports of Odesa, Chornomorsk and Yuzhny.\n\nSmaller Ukrainian pilot boats will guide the vessels through approved corridors. The entire operation will be overseen by a Joint Coordination Center in Istanbul staffed by officials from Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the United Nations.\n\nOnce ships reach port, they will be loaded with grain before departing back to the Bosphorus Strait, where they will be boarded to inspect them for weapons. There will likely be inspections for ships embarking to Ukraine as well.\n\nCIVILIANS KILLED\n\nIn other developments Friday, the Ukrainian presidential office said at least 13 civilians were killed and another 36 wounded in Russian shelling over the last 24 hours.\n\nIn the southern city of Mykolaiv, at least four people were killed and seven others wounded when Russian shelling hit a bus stop. The Russian barrage also hit a facility that distributed humanitarian aid where three people were wounded, officials said.\n\nUkrainian officials also said at least four civilians were killed and five hurt in the eastern town of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region.\n\nAn appeals court in Kyiv on Friday reduced to 15 years the life sentence of a Russian soldier convicted in the first war crimes trial since Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nCritics had said the sentencing of Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was unduly harsh given that he confessed to the crime and expressed remorse.

Russia and Ukraine accused each other Friday of shelling the prison in Olenivka in a separatist region of eastern Ukraine, an attack that reportedly killed dozens of Ukrainian military prisoners who were captured after the fall of a southern port city of Mariupol in May.\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia launched nighttime attacks on several Ukrainian cities, Ukrainian officials said Saturday as they and Moscow blamed each other for the deaths of dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war in a separatist-controlled area of the country's east.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross have a duty to react after shelling of a prison complex in Donetsk province killed the POWS.\n\n\"It was a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war,\" Zelenskyy said in a video address late Friday. \"There should be a clear legal recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.\"\n\nBoth sides alleged the attack on the prison was premeditated and intended to silence the Ukrainian prisoners and to destroy evidence, including of possible atrocities.\n\nRussia claimed Ukraine's military used U.S.-supplied precision rocket launchers to target the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic.\n\nThe Ukrainian military, however, denied making any rocket or artillery strikes in Olenivka. It accused the Russians of shelling the prison to cover up the alleged torture and execution of Ukrainians there.\n\nSeparatist authorities and Russian officials said the attack killed 53 Ukrainian POWs and wounded another 75. Russia's Defense Ministry on Saturday issued a list naming 48 Ukrainian fighters, their ages ranging from 20 to 62, who died in the attack; it was not clear if the ministry had revised its fatality count.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross, which has organized civilian evacuations in the war and worked to monitor the treatment of POWS held by Russia and Ukraine, said it has requested access to the prison \"to determine the health and condition of all the people present on-site at the time of the attack.\"\n\n\"Our priority right now is making sure that the wounded receive life-saving treatment and that the bodies of those who lost their lives are dealt with in a dignified manner,\" the Red Cross said in a statement.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian rockets hit a school building in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, overnight, and another attack occurred about an hour later, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Saturday. There were no immediate reports of injuries.\n\nThe bus station in the city of Sloviansk also was hit, according to Mayor Vadim Lyakh. Sloviansk is near the front line of fighting as Russian and separatist forces try to take full control of the Donetsk region, one of two eastern provinces that Russia has recognized as sovereign states.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, one person was killed and six injured in shelling that hit a residential area in Mykolaiv, a significant port city, the region's administration said Saturday on Facebook.\n\nFriday's attack on the prison reportedly killed Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in May after the fall of Mariupol, another port city where troops and the Azov Regiment of the national guard famously held out against a monthslong Russian siege.\n\nOn Saturday, an association of Azov fighters' relatives held a demonstration outside Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and issued a statement calling for Russia to be designated a terrorist state for violating the Geneva Convention's rules for the treatment of war prisoners.\n\nMoscow opened a probe into the attack on POW prison, sending a team to the site from Russia's Investigative Committee, the country's main criminal investigation agency.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said the competing claims and limited information prevented assigning responsibility for the attack but that the \"available visual evidence appears to support the Ukrainian claim more than the Russian.\"\n\nOn the energy front, Russia's state-owned natural gas corporation said Saturday it has halted shipments to Latvia because of contract violations.

Both sides said the assault was premeditated with the aim of covering up atrocities.

Denis Pushilin, the leader of the internationally unrecognized Donetsk republic, said the prison held 193 inmates. He did not specify how many were Ukrainian POWs. The deputy commander of the Donetsk separatist forces, Eduard Basurin, suggested that Ukraine decided to strike the prison to prevent captives from revealing key military information.

The International Red Cross asked to visit the prison to make sure the scores of wounded POWs had proper treatment but said their request had not been granted so far.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia kept on launching attacks on several Ukrainian cities, hitting a school and a bus station.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the ICRC and the United Nations have a duty to react after the shelling Friday of the prison complex in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk province.\n\n\"It was a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war,\" Zelenskyy said in a video address late Friday. \"There should be a clear legal recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.\"\n\nSeparatist authorities and Russian officials said the attack killed 53 Ukrainian POWs and wounded another 75. Russia's Defense Ministry on Saturday issued a list naming 48 Ukrainian fighters, aged 20 to 62, who died in the attack; it was not clear if the ministry had revised its fatality count.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross, which has organized civilian evacuations and worked to monitor the treatment of POWs held by Russia and Ukraine, said it requested access to the prison \"to determine the health and condition of all the people present on-site at the time of the attack.\"\n\n\"Our priority right now is making sure that the wounded receive lifesaving treatment and that the bodies of those who lost their lives are dealt with in a dignified manner,\" the Red Cross said.\n\nBut the organization said late Saturday that its request to access the prison had not been granted.\n\n\"Granting ICRC access to POWs is an obligation of parties to conflict under the Geneva Conventions,\" the ICRC said on Twitter. \"We will not stop seeking access to these POWs and to all POWs of this international armed conflict who we have not had access to yet.\"\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia alleged the attack on the prison was premeditated and intended to silence the Ukrainian prisoners and destroy evidence.\n\nRussia claimed Ukraine's military used U.S.-supplied precision rocket launchers to target the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic.\n\nThe Ukrainian military denied making any rocket or artillery strikes in Olenivka.

U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said \"we stand ready to send a group of experts able to conduct an investigation, requiring the consent of the parties, and we fully support the initiatives\" of the Red Cross.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian rockets hit a school in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, overnight, and another attack occurred an hour later, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Saturday. There were no immediate reports of injuries.\n\nThe bus station in the city of Sloviansk also was hit, according to Mayor Vadim Lyakh. Sloviansk is near the front line of fighting as Russian and separatist forces try to take full control of the Donetsk region, one of two eastern provinces that Russia has recognized as sovereign states.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned Saturday that Ukrainian-controlled parts of the Donetsk region will face severe heating problems this winter because of the extensive destruction of gas mains. She called for a mandatory evacuation of residents before the cold weather sets in.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, one person was killed and six injured in shelling that hit a residential area in Mykolaiv, a port city, the regional government said.\n\nFriday's attack on the prison reportedly killed Ukrainian soldiers captured in May after the fall of Mariupol, a Black Sea port city where troops and the Azov Regiment of the national guard famously held out against a months-long Russian siege.\n\nOn Saturday, an association of Azov fighters' relatives dressed in black held a demonstration outside Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and called for Russia to be designated a terrorist state for violating the Geneva Convention's rules for the treatment of war prisoners.\n\nA woman wearing dark glasses who gave only her first name, Iryna, was waiting for news of her 23-year-old son.\n\n\"I don't know how is he, where is he, if he is alive or no. I don't know. It's a horror, only horror. For a mother, it's the biggest loss if her child has gone,\" she said.\n\nOn the energy front, Russia's state-owned natural gas corporation said Saturday it has halted shipments to Latvia because of contract violations. Gas giant Gazprom said the shipments were stopped because Latvia broke \"terms for extraction of gas.\" It did not elaborate.\n\nThe statement likely referred to a refusal to meet Russia's demand for gas payments in rubles rather than other currencies. Gazprom has previously suspended gas shipments to other EU countries, including the Netherlands, Poland and Bulgaria, because they would not pay in rubles.\n\nEU nations have been scrambling to secure other energy sources, fearing that Russia will cut off more gas supplies as winter approaches.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "susie_blann@eagletribune.com", "name": "Susie Blann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/44/84416adc-db50-5186-82b3-76b4dbd75404/62e40fd721e6c.image.jpg?crop=1875%2C984%2C0%2C60&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 31, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 43, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7133551243", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-30", "time": "10:34:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-30T10:34:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-30T10:32:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "url": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/nation-world/story/2022-07-30/ukraine-says-russian-attacks-hit-kharkiv-mykolaiv", "title": "Ukraine says Russian attacks hit Kharkiv, Mykolaiv", "body": "Russia launched nighttime attacks on several cities in Ukraine, Ukrainian officials said Saturday as they and officials in Moscow blamed each other for the deaths of dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war in a separatist-controlled area of the country's east.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross have a duty to react after shelling of a prison complex in Donetsk province killed the POWS.\n\n\"It was a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war,\" Zelenskyy said in a video address late Friday. \"There should be a clear legal recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.\"\n\nBoth sides alleged the attack on the prison was premeditated and intended to silence the Ukrainian prisoners and to destroy evidence, including of possible atrocities.\n\nRussia claimed Ukraine's military used U.S.-supplied precision rocket launchers to target the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic.\n\nSeparatist authorities and Russian officials said the attack killed 53 Ukrainian POWs and wounded another 75.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross, which has organized civilian evacuations in the war and worked to monitor the treatment of POWS held by Russia and Ukraine, said it has requested access to the prison \"to determine the health and condition of all the people present on-site at the time of the attack.\"\n\n\"Our priority right now is making sure that the wounded receive life-saving treatment and that the bodies of those who lost their lives are dealt with in a dignified manner,\" the Red Cross said in a statement.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian rockets hit a school building in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, overnight, and another attack occurred about an hour later, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Saturday.

Russia and Ukraine accused each other Friday of shelling a prison in a separatist region of eastern Ukraine, an attack that reportedly killed dozens of Ukrainian military prisoners who were captured after the fall of a southern port city of Mariupol in May. Associated Press\n\nKYIV, Ukraine -- A request by the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit a shelled prison where dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war died went unanswered Saturday, as Ukrainian and Russian officials continued to blame each other for the attack on a prison in a separatist-controlled area.\n\nThe ICRC asked to visit the prison to make sure the scores of wounded POWs had proper treatment, but said that as of late Saturday their request had not been granted.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia kept on launching attacks on several Ukrainian cities, hitting a school and a bus station.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the ICRC and the United Nations have a duty to react after the shelling Friday of the prison complex in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk province.\n\n\"It was a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war,\" Zelenskyy said in a video address late Friday. \"There should be a clear legal recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.\"\n\nSeparatist authorities and Russian officials said the attack killed 53 Ukrainian POWs and wounded another 75. Russia's Defense Ministry on Saturday issued a list naming 48 Ukrainian fighters, aged 20 to 62, who died in the attack; it was not clear if the ministry had revised its fatality count.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ICRC has organized civilian evacuations and worked to monitor the treatment of POWs held by Russia and Ukraine. \"Our priority right now is making sure that the wounded receive lifesaving treatment and that the bodies of those who lost their lives are dealt with in a dignified manner,\" the Red Cross said.\n\n\"Granting ICRC access to POWs is an obligation of parties to conflict under the Geneva Conventions,\" the ICRC said on Twitter. \"We will not stop seeking access to these POWs and to all POWs of this international armed conflict who we have not had access to yet.\"\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia alleged the attack on the prison was premeditated and intended to silence the Ukrainian prisoners and destroy evidence.\n\nRussia claimed Ukraine's military used U.S.-supplied precision rocket launchers to target the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic.\n\nThe Ukrainian military denied making any rocket or artillery strikes in Olenivka. It accused the Russians of shelling the prison to cover up the alleged torture and execution of Ukrainians there.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said the competing claims and limited information prevented assigning full responsibility for the attack but the \"available visual evidence appears to support the Ukrainian claim more than the Russian.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoscow has opened a probe into the attack on the prison and the United Nations said it also was prepared to send investigators. U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said \"we stand ready to send a group of experts able to conduct an investigation, requiring the consent of the parties, and we fully support the initiatives\" of the Red Cross.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian rockets hit a school in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, overnight, and another attack occurred an hour later, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Saturday. There were no immediate reports of injuries.\n\nThe bus station in the city of Sloviansk also was hit, according to Mayor Vadim Lyakh. Sloviansk is near the front line of fighting as Russian and separatist forces try to take full control of the Donetsk region, one of two eastern provinces that Russia has recognized as sovereign states.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned Saturday that Ukrainian-controlled parts of the Donetsk region will face severe heating problems this winter because of the extensive destruction of gas mains. She called for a mandatory evacuation of residents before the cold weather sets in.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, one person was killed and six injured in shelling that hit a residential area in Mykolaiv, a port city, the regional government said.\n\nFriday's attack on the prison reportedly killed Ukrainian soldiers captured in May after the fall of Mariupol, a Black Sea port city where troops and the Azov Regiment of the national guard famously held out against a months-long Russian siege.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Saturday, an association of Azov fighters' relatives dressed in black held a demonstration outside Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and called for Russia to be designated a terrorist state for violating the Geneva Convention's rules for the treatment of war prisoners.\n\nA woman wearing dark glasses who gave only her first name, Iryna, was waiting for news of her 23-year-old son.\n\n\"I don't know how is he, where is he, if he is alive or no. I don't know. It's a horror, only horror. For a mother, it's the biggest loss if her child has gone,\" she said.\n\nOn the energy front, Russia's state-owned natural gas corporation said Saturday it has halted shipments to Latvia because of contract violations. Gas giant Gazprom said the shipments were stopped because Latvia broke \"terms for extraction of gas.\" It did not elaborate.\n\nThe statement likely referred to a refusal to meet Russia's demand for gas payments in rubles rather than other currencies. Gazprom has previously suspended gas shipments to other EU countries, including the Netherlands, Poland and Bulgaria, because they would not pay in rubles.\n\nEU nations have been scrambling to secure other energy sources, fearing that Russia will cut off more gas supplies as winter approaches.\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the shelling as \"a deliberate, cynical, calculated mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners.\"\n\nNeither claim could be independently verified.\n\nVideo shot by The Associated Press showed charred, twisted bed frames in the wrecked barracks, as well as burned bodies and metal sheets hanging from the destroyed roof. The footage also included bodies lined up on the ground next to a barbed-wire fence and an array of what was claimed to be metal rocket fragments on a wooden bench.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the internationally unrecognized Donetsk republic, said the prison held 193 inmates. He did not specify how many were Ukrainian POWs.\n\nThe deputy commander of the Donetsk separatist forces, Eduard Basurin, suggested that Ukraine decided to strike the prison to prevent captives from revealing key military information.\n\nUkraine \"knew exactly where they were being held and in what place,\" he said. \"After the Ukrainian prisoners of war began to talk about the crimes they committed, and orders they received from Kyiv, a decision was made by the political leadership of Ukraine: carry out a strike here.\"\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called for a \"strict investigation\" into the attack and urged the United Nations and other international organizations to condemn it. He said the Russians had transferred some Ukrainian prisoners to the barracks just a few days before the strike, suggesting that it was planned.\n\n\"The purpose -- to discredit Ukraine in front of our partners and disrupt weapons supply,\" he tweeted.\n\nUkrainian officials alleged that Russia's Wagner Group, mercenaries Russia has used in other armed conflicts and reportedly elsewhere in Ukraine, carried out the assault.\n\nUkraine's security agencies issued a statement citing evidence that Russia was responsible, including the transfer of prisoners, analysis of injuries and the blast wave, intercepted phone conversations and the absence of shelling at the site.\n\n\"All this leaves no doubt: The explosion in Olenivka was a Russian terrorist act and a gross violation of international agreements,\" the statement said.\n\nA Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson, Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, described the strike as a \"bloody provocation\" aimed at discouraging Ukrainian soldiers from surrendering. He too claimed that U.S.-supplied HIMARS rockets were used, and said eight guards were among the wounded.\n\nUkrainian forces are fighting to hold on to the remaining territory under their control in Donetsk. Together with the neighboring Luhansk province, they make up Ukraine's mostly Russian-speaking industrial Donbas region.\n\nFor several months, Moscow has focused on trying to seize parts of the Donbas not already held by the separatists.\n\nHolding POWs in an area with active fighting appeared to defy the Geneva Convention, which requires that prisoners be evacuated as soon as possible after capture to camps away from combat zones.\n\nThe Ukrainian POWS at the Donetsk prison included troops captured during the fall of Mariupol. They spent months holed up with civilians at a giant steel mill in the southern port city. Their resistance during a relentless Russian bombardment became a symbol of Ukrainian defiance against Russia's aggression.\n\nMore than 2,400 soldiers from the Azov Regiment of the Ukrainian national guard and other military units gave up their fight and surrendered under orders from Ukraine's military in May.\n\nScores of Ukrainian soldiers have been taken to prisons in Russian-controlled areas. Some have returned to Ukraine as part of prisoner exchanges with Russia, but the families of other POWs have no idea whether their loved ones are still alive, or if they will ever come home.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by phone to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in the highest-level known contact between the two sides since Russia invaded Ukraine. Blinken urged Russia to accept a deal to win the release of American detainees Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan.\n\n-- Ukraine's president visited one of the country's main Black Sea ports a week after a deal was struck to create safe corridors for grain shipments that have been trapped in the country since the war began. Workers were seen preparing terminals for grain exports, which are relied on by millions of impoverished people worldwide. Zelenskyy said the shipments would begin with the departure of several vessels that were already loaded but could not leave when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\n-- The Ukrainian presidential office said at least 13 civilians were killed and another 36 wounded in Russian shelling over the last 24 hours. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, at least four people were killed and seven others wounded when Russian shelling hit a bus stop. The Russian barrage also hit a facility that distributed humanitarian aid where three people were wounded, officials said. Ukrainian officials also said at least four civilians were killed and five hurt in the eastern town of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region.\n\n-- An appeals court in Kyiv on Friday reduced to 15 years the life sentence of a Russian soldier convicted in the first war crimes trial since Russia invaded Ukraine. Critics had said the sentencing of Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was unduly harsh given that he confessed to the crime and expressed remorse. He pleaded guilty to killing a civilian and was convicted in May. His defense lawyer argued that Shishimarin shot a Ukrainian man on the orders of his superiors.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the shelling as \"a deliberate, cynical, calculated mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners.\"\n\nNeither claim could be independently verified.\n\nVideo shot by The Associated Press showed charred, twisted bed frames in the wrecked barracks, as well as burned bodies and metal sheets hanging from the destroyed roof. The footage also included bodies lined up on the ground next to a barbed-wire fence and an array of what was claimed to be metal rocket fragments on a wooden bench.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the internationally unrecognized Donetsk republic, said the prison held 193 inmates. He did not specify how many were Ukrainian POWs.\n\nThe deputy commander of the Donetsk separatist forces, Eduard Basurin, suggested that Ukraine decided to strike the prison to prevent captives from revealing key military information.\n\nUkraine \"knew exactly where they were being held and in what place,\" he said. \"After the Ukrainian prisoners of war began to talk about the crimes they committed, and orders they received from Kyiv, a decision was made by the political leadership of Ukraine: carry out a strike here.\"\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called for a \"strict investigation\" into the attack and urged the United Nations and other international organizations to condemn it. He said the Russians had transferred some Ukrainian prisoners to the barracks just a few days before the strike, suggesting that it was planned.\n\n\"The purpose -- to discredit Ukraine in front of our partners and disrupt weapons supply,\" he tweeted.\n\nUkrainian officials alleged that Russia's Wagner Group, mercenaries Russia has used in other armed conflicts and reportedly elsewhere in Ukraine, carried out the assault.\n\nUkraine's security agencies issued a statement citing evidence that Russia was responsible, including the transfer of prisoners, analysis of injuries and the blast wave, intercepted phone conversations and the absence of shelling at the site.\n\n\"All this leaves no doubt: The explosion in Olenivka was a Russian terrorist act and a gross violation of international agreements,\" the statement said.\n\nA Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson, Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, described the strike as a \"bloody provocation\" aimed at discouraging Ukrainian soldiers from surrendering. He too claimed that U.S.-supplied HIMARS rockets were used, and said eight guards were among the wounded.\n\nUkrainian forces are fighting to hold on to the remaining territory under their control in Donetsk. Together with the neighboring Luhansk province, they make up Ukraine's mostly Russian-speaking industrial Donbas region.\n\nFor several months, Moscow has focused on trying to seize parts of the Donbas not already held by the separatists.\n\nHolding POWs in an area with active fighting appeared to defy the Geneva Convention, which requires that prisoners be evacuated as soon as possible after capture to camps away from combat zones.\n\nThe Ukrainian POWS at the Donetsk prison included troops captured during the fall of Mariupol. They spent months holed up with civilians at a giant steel mill in the southern port city. Their resistance during a relentless Russian bombardment became a symbol of Ukrainian defiance against Russia's aggression.\n\nMore than 2,400 soldiers from the Azov Regiment of the Ukrainian national guard and other military units gave up their fight and surrendered under orders from Ukraine's military in May.\n\nScores of Ukrainian soldiers have been taken to prisons in Russian-controlled areas. Some have returned to Ukraine as part of prisoner exchanges with Russia, but the families of other POWs have no idea whether their loved ones are still alive, or if they will ever come home.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by phone to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in the highest-level known contact between the two sides since Russia invaded Ukraine. Blinken urged Russia to accept a deal to win the release of American detainees Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan.\n\n-- Ukraine's president visited one of the country's main Black Sea ports a week after a deal was struck to create safe corridors for grain shipments that have been trapped in the country since the war began. Workers were seen preparing terminals for grain exports, which are relied on by millions of impoverished people worldwide. Zelenskyy said the shipments would begin with the departure of several vessels that were already loaded but could not leave when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\n-- The Ukrainian presidential office said at least 13 civilians were killed and another 36 wounded in Russian shelling over the last 24 hours. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, at least four people were killed and seven others wounded when Russian shelling hit a bus stop. The Russian barrage also hit a facility that distributed humanitarian aid where three people were wounded, officials said. Ukrainian officials also said at least four civilians were killed and five hurt in the eastern town of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region.\n\n-- An appeals court in Kyiv on Friday reduced to 15 years the life sentence of a Russian soldier convicted in the first war crimes trial since Russia invaded Ukraine. Critics had said the sentencing of Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was unduly harsh given that he confessed to the crime and expressed remorse. He pleaded guilty to killing a civilian and was convicted in May. His defense lawyer argued that Shishimarin shot a Ukrainian man on the orders of his superiors.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Both sides said the assault was premeditated with the aim of covering up atrocities.\n\nRussia claimed that Ukraine's military used U.S.-supplied multiple rocket launchers to strike the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic. Separatist authorities and Russian officials said the attack killed 53 Ukrainian POWs and wounded another 75.\n\nMoscow opened a probe into the attack, sending a team to the site from Russia's Investigative Committee, the country's main criminal investigation agency. The state RIA Novosti agency reported that fragments of U.S.-supplied precision High Mobility Artillery Rocket System rockets were found at the site.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Second Paladino campaign aide has criminal record\n\nThe Ukrainian military denied making any rocket or artillery strikes in Olenivka, and accused the Russians of shelling the prison to cover up the alleged torture and execution of Ukrainians there. An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the shelling as a \"a deliberate, cynical, calculated mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners.\"\n\nNeither claim could be independently verified.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the internationally unrecognized Donetsk republic, said the prison held 193 inmates. He didn't specify how many were Ukrainian POWs.\n\nThe deputy commander of the Donetsk separatist forces, Eduard Basurin, suggested that Ukraine decided to strike the prison to prevent captives from revealing key military information.\n\nUkraine \"knew exactly where they were being held and in what place,\" he said. \"After the Ukrainian prisoners of war began to talk about the crimes they committed, and orders they received from Kyiv, a decision was made by the political leadership of Ukraine: carry out a strike here.\"\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called for a \"strict investigation\" into the deadly attack and urged the United Nations and other international organizations to condemn it. He said the Russians had transferred some Ukrainian prisoners to the barrack that was hit just a few days before the strike, suggesting that it was planned.\n\n\"The purpose -- to discredit Ukraine in front of our partners and disrupt weapons supply,\" he tweeted.\n\nA Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson, Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, described the strike as a \"bloody provocation\" aimed at discouraging Ukrainian soldiers from surrendering. He too claimed that U.S.-supplied HIMARS rockets were used, and said eight guards were among the wounded.\n\nUkrainian forces are fighting to hold on to the remaining territory under their control in Donetsk, which together with neighboring Luhansk province makes up Ukraine's mostly Russian-speaking industrial Donbas region.\n\nFor several months of the war in Ukraine, Moscow has focused on trying to seize parts of the Donbas not already held by the separatists. Ukrainian authorities in the Donetsk region accused Russia on Friday of shelling civilian targets in Ukrainian-held areas.\n\n\"The fighting in the region has been intensifying by the day, and civilians must evacuate while it's still possible,\" Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said. \"The Russian army doesn't worry about civilian casualties. They are pummeling cities and villages in the region.\"\n\nHe later said one person was killed and five injured Friday in Russian rocket strike on the city of Kramatorsk.\n\nThe Ukrainian POWS at the Donetsk prison included troops captured during the fall of Mariupol. They spent months holed up with civilians at a giant steel mill in the southern port city. Their resistance during a relentless Russian bombardment became a symbol of Ukrainian defiance against Russia's aggression.\n\nMore than 2,400 soldiers from the Azov Regiment of the Ukrainian national guard and other military units gave up their fight and surrendered under orders from Ukraine's military in May.\n\nScores of Ukrainian soldiers have been taken to prisons in Russian-controlled areas. Some have returned to Ukraine as part of prisoner exchanges with Russia, but the families of other POWs have no idea whether their loved ones are still alive, or if they will ever come home.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- Ukraine's president visited one of Ukraine's main Black Sea ports a week after a deal was struck with Russia, Turkey and the United Nations to create safe corridors for ships to export grains that have been trapped in the country since the war began. Workers were seen preparing terminals for Ukraine's grain exports, which are relied on by millions of impoverished hungry people worldwide. Zelenskyy said the shipments would begin with the departure of several vessels that were already loaded but could not depart when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\n-- The Ukrainian presidential office said at least 13 civilians were killed and another 36 were wounded in Russian shelling over the last 24 hours. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, at least four people were killed and seven others were wounded when Russian shelling hit a bus stop. The Russian barrage also hit a facility that distributed humanitarian aid where three people were wounded, officials said. Ukrainian officials also said at least four civilians were killed and five wounded in the eastern town of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region.\n\n-- An appeals court in Kyiv on Friday reduced to 15 years the life sentence of a Russian soldier convicted in the first war crimes trial since Russia invaded Ukraine. Critics had said the sentencing of Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was unduly harsh given that he confessed to the crime and expressed remorse. He pleaded guilty to killing a civilian and was convicted in May. His defense lawyer argued that Shishimarin shot a Ukrainian man on the orders of his superiors.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

The International Red Cross asked to visit the prison to make sure the wounded had proper treatment.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross have a duty to react after shelling of a prison complex in Donetsk province killed the POWs.\n\n\"It was a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war,\" Zelenskyy said in a video address late Friday. \"There should be a clear legal recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.\"\n\nSeparatist authorities and Russian officials said the attack killed 53 Ukrainian POWs and wounded another 75. Russia's Defense Ministry on Saturday issued a list naming 48 Ukrainian fighters, their ages ranging from 20 to 62, who died in the attack; it was not clear if the ministry had revised its fatality count.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross, which has organized civilian evacuations in the war and worked to monitor the treatment of POWS held by Russia and Ukraine, said it has requested access to the prison \"to determine the health and condition of all the people present on-site at the time of the attack.\"\n\n\"Our priority right now is making sure that the wounded receive lifesaving treatment and that the bodies of those who lost their lives are dealt with in a dignified manner,\" the Red Cross said.\n\nBoth sides alleged the attack on the prison was premeditated and intended to silence the Ukrainian prisoners and to destroy evidence, including of possible atrocities.\n\nRussia claimed Ukraine's military used U.S.-supplied precision rocket launchers to target the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic.\n\nThe Ukrainian military, however, denied making any rocket or artillery strikes in Olenivka. It accused the Russians of shelling the prison to cover up the alleged torture and execution of Ukrainians there.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian rockets hit a school in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, overnight, and another attack occurred an hour later, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Saturday. There were no immediate reports of injuries.\n\nThe bus station in the city of Sloviansk also was hit, according to Mayor Vadim Lyakh. Sloviansk is near the front line of fighting as Russian and separatist forces try to take full control of the Donetsk region, one of two eastern provinces that Russia has recognized as sovereign states.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, one person was killed and six injured in shelling that hit a residential area in Mykolaiv, a significant port city, the region's administration said Saturday on Facebook.\n\nFriday's attack on the prison reportedly killed Ukrainian soldiers captured in May after the fall of Mariupol, a Black Sea port city where troops and the Azov Regiment of the national guard famously held out against a monthslong Russian siege.\n\nOn Saturday, an association of Azov fighters' relatives dressed in black held a demonstration outside Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and issued a statement calling for Russia to be designated a terrorist state for violating the Geneva Convention's rules for the treatment of war prisoners.\n\nA woman wearing dark glasses who gave only her first name, Iryna, was waiting for news of her 23 year-old-son.\n\n\"I don't know how is he, where is he, if he is alive or no. I don't know. It's a horror, only horror. For a mother, it's the biggest loss if her child has gone,\" she said.\n\nMoscow has opened a probe into the attack on POW prison, sending a team to the site from Russia's Investigative Committee, the country's main criminal investigation agency.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said the competing claims and limited information prevented assigning full responsibility for the attack but the \"available visual evidence appears to support the Ukrainian claim more than the Russian.\"\n\nOn the energy front, Russia's state-owned natural gas corporation said Saturday it has halted shipments to Latvia because of contract violations. Gas giant Gazprom said the shipments were stopped because Latvia broke \"terms for extraction of gas.\" It did not elaborate.\n\nThe statement likely referred to a refusal to meet Russia's demand for gas payments in rubles rather than other currencies. Gazprom has previously suspended gas shipments to other EU countries, including the Netherlands, Poland and Bulgaria, because they would not pay in rubles.\n\nEU nations have been scrambling to secure other energy sources, fearing that Russia will cut off more gas supplies as winter approaches.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk on Saturday warned that the parts of Donetsk region that remain under Ukrainian control will face severe heating problems this winter because of the extensive destruction of gas mains in the war. She called for a mandatory evacuation of residents of the region before the cold weather sets in.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Both sides said the assault was premeditated with the aim of covering up atrocities.\n\nRussia claimed that Ukraine's military used U.S.-supplied multiple rocket launchers to strike the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic. Separatist authorities and Russian officials said the attack killed 53 Ukrainian POWs and wounded another 75.\n\nMoscow opened a probe into the attack, sending a team to the site from Russia's Investigative Committee, the country's main criminal investigation agency. The state RIA Novosti agency reported that fragments of U.S.-supplied precision High Mobility Artillery Rocket System rockets were found at the site.\n\nPeople are also reading...

An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the shelling as a \"a deliberate, cynical, calculated mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners.\"\n\nNeither claim could be independently verified.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the internationally unrecognized Donetsk republic, said the prison held 193 inmates. He didn't specify how many were Ukrainian POWs.\n\nThe deputy commander of the Donetsk separatist forces, Eduard Basurin, suggested that Ukraine decided to strike the prison to prevent captives from revealing key military information.\n\nUkraine \"knew exactly where they were being held and in what place,\" he said. \"After the Ukrainian prisoners of war began to talk about the crimes they committed, and orders they received from Kyiv, a decision was made by the political leadership of Ukraine: carry out a strike here.\"\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called for a \"strict investigation\" into the deadly attack and urged the United Nations and other international organizations to condemn it. He said the Russians had transferred some Ukrainian prisoners to the barrack that was hit just a few days before the strike, suggesting that it was planned.\n\n\"The purpose -- to discredit Ukraine in front of our partners and disrupt weapons supply,\" he tweeted.\n\nA Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson, Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, described the strike as a \"bloody provocation\" aimed at discouraging Ukrainian soldiers from surrendering. He too claimed that U.S.-supplied HIMARS rockets were used, and said eight guards were among the wounded.\n\nUkrainian forces are fighting to hold on to the remaining territory under their control in Donetsk, which together with neighboring Luhansk province makes up Ukraine's mostly Russian-speaking industrial Donbas region.\n\nFor several months of the war in Ukraine, Moscow has focused on trying to seize parts of the Donbas not already held by the separatists. Ukrainian authorities in the Donetsk region accused Russia on Friday of shelling civilian targets in Ukrainian-held areas.\n\n\"The fighting in the region has been intensifying by the day, and civilians must evacuate while it's still possible,\" Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said. \"The Russian army doesn't worry about civilian casualties. They are pummeling cities and villages in the region.\"\n\nHe later said one person was killed and five injured Friday in Russian rocket strike on the city of Kramatorsk.\n\nThe Ukrainian POWS at the Donetsk prison included troops captured during the fall of Mariupol. They spent months holed up with civilians at a giant steel mill in the southern port city. Their resistance during a relentless Russian bombardment became a symbol of Ukrainian defiance against Russia's aggression.\n\nMore than 2,400 soldiers from the Azov Regiment of the Ukrainian national guard and other military units gave up their fight and surrendered under orders from Ukraine's military in May.\n\nScores of Ukrainian soldiers have been taken to prisons in Russian-controlled areas. Some have returned to Ukraine as part of prisoner exchanges with Russia, but the families of other POWs have no idea whether their loved ones are still alive, or if they will ever come home.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- Ukraine's president visited one of Ukraine's main Black Sea ports a week after a deal was struck with Russia, Turkey and the United Nations to create safe corridors for ships to export grains that have been trapped in the country since the war began. Workers were seen preparing terminals for Ukraine's grain exports, which are relied on by millions of impoverished hungry people worldwide. Zelenskyy said the shipments would begin with the departure of several vessels that were already loaded but could not depart when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\n-- The Ukrainian presidential office said at least 13 civilians were killed and another 36 were wounded in Russian shelling over the last 24 hours. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, at least four people were killed and seven others were wounded when Russian shelling hit a bus stop. The Russian barrage also hit a facility that distributed humanitarian aid where three people were wounded, officials said. Ukrainian officials also said at least four civilians were killed and five wounded in the eastern town of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region.\n\n-- An appeals court in Kyiv on Friday reduced to 15 years the life sentence of a Russian soldier convicted in the first war crimes trial since Russia invaded Ukraine. Critics had said the sentencing of Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was unduly harsh given that he confessed to the crime and expressed remorse. He pleaded guilty to killing a civilian and was convicted in May. His defense lawyer argued that Shishimarin shot a Ukrainian man on the orders of his superiors.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

a sign it is running short of combat infantry as Kyiv steps up a counter-offensive in the south.\n\nGreater reliance on fighters from the Russian private military company Wagner Group for frontline duties rather than their usual work in special operations would be another sign that Russia's military is under stress six months into its war in Ukraine.\n\nBut the British defence ministry said in the update that Wagner mercenaries were unlikely to make up for the loss of regular infantry units or alter the trajectory of Russia's invasion.\n\n'This is a significant change from the previous employment of the group since 2015, when it typically undertook missions distinct from overt, large-scale regular Russian military activity,' the ministry said.\n\nWagner and the Kremlin were not immediately available for comment.\n\nOfficials in Kyiv said on Wednesday they had observed a 'massive redeployment' of Russian forces to the south where British defence officials believe Russia's 49th Army, stationed on the west bank of the Dnipro River, is vulnerable.\n\nUkraine's counter-attacks in the south come as Russia battles for control of the entirety of the industrialised Donbas region in the east, comprising the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\nRussia 'has prepared EVACUATION plans for Putin in case his army is defeated in Ukraine' claims Telegram channel which also alleged Vladimir is suffering numerous health problems\n\nVladimir Putin and his friends are making preparations to flee Russia should his army be defeated in Ukraine, according to a Telegram channel that claims to come from inside the Kremlin.\n\nWith his Donbas offensive stalling, Ukraine preparing to re-capture Kherson and his economy crumbling, the Russian dictator is 'aware of the possibility of a sharp change of mood in the country.'\n\nLast week, the General SVR channel reported that the 69-year-old had suffered from 'severe nausea' overnight, with doctors at his bedside for around three hours.\n\nFollowing on from that report, they claim that 'Putin himself and his entourage are preparing plans for evacuation from Russia.'\n\nIt is thought that any plane carrying Putin and his family out of Russia would head to fellow dictatorship Syria, the nearest friendly state and whose leader, Bashar al-Assad, Putin bailed out by intervening in the Syrian civil war in 2015.\n\nAny flight from Russia to Syria, however, would have to fly through the airspace of Turkey, a NATO member.\n\nVladimir Putin and his friends are reported to be making preparations to flee Russia should his army be defeated in Ukraine\n\nIt is thought that any plane carrying Putin and his family out of Russia might head to fellow dictatorship Syria, whose dictator Bashar al-Assad (pictured left) Putin bailed out by intervening in the Syrian civil war in 2015\n\nWere Turkey's strongman leader, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, to refuse permission to the plane carrying Putin and his family to enter his airspace, it would effectively scupper the Russian tyrant's quickest and perhaps only getaway route.\n\nErdogan and Putin have a complex relationship, having been friends and enemies at various times over the past decade as each leader tries to navigate their country through a challenging geopolitical neighbourhood.\n\nIran is another regional power - and Western foe - that would be interested in Putin's fate.\n\n'In principle, it is beneficial for Iran and Turkey to keep the Russian president in exile in reserve, using him, depending on the situation, as a lever or as a bargaining chip,' the channel states.\n\nAlthough Turkey is a member of the Western military alliance, under Erdogan's leadership the country has cut its own diplomatic path in international relations.\n\nEarlier this month Putin met with his Turkish and Iranian counterparts in Tehran, ostensibly to discuss Syria.\n\nIt is not too much of a stretch to imagine that Erdogan and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi discussed in private the possibility of Putin requiring asylum from a coup or revolution at home.\n\nPutin, met with Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi, and Turkish president Erdogan in Tehran - to leaders who would have a strong interest if Putin needed asylum\n\nErdogan (left) and Putin (right) have a complex relationship, having been friends and enemies at various times over the past decade as each leader tries to navigate their country through challenging geopolitical times\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian forces were said yesterday to be gaining momentum near the occupied city of Kherson.\n\nAir strikes have destroyed several bridges leaving the remaining Russian troops cut off, and a counteroffensive to re-take the only major city that Russia managed to capture is expected in the coming weeks.\n\nBack home for Putin, Yale experts state that Russia is losing the economic war with the West and its economy is in catastrophic and irrevocable decline.\n\nRussia is on the ropes, with business in retreat and sanctions catastrophically crippling their economy, they claim.\n\nEvery single sector of the Russian economy is in trouble - both its imports and its exports are down and its allies are not helping, and in some cases actively taking advantage.\n\nWith the cataclysmic state of the Russian economy in mind, it is no wonder that Putin might be considering retirement in Syria.\n\nBut even then it is questionable whether he will receive the medical care that he reportedly needs.\n\nThe Russian army has used the Antonivskiy bridge over the Dnipro River as a key resupply route into Kherson, now blown up by Ukrainian missiles as they prepare a counteroffensive\n\nThe General SVR channel, which claims to be run by a former officer from Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, said earlier this week: 'Putin on the night of Friday July 22 to Saturday July 23 needed urgent medical care.\n\n'At about 1am, the medical workers on duty at [his] residence were summoned to the president. Putin complained of severe nausea.\n\n'Twenty minutes later, an additional team of doctors with the president's attending physicians was called.\n\n'It is known that doctors provided assistance and were near Putin for three hours, and after the president's condition improved, they left his chambers.'\n\nIt claimed a decision was made that in some events this week 'he will be replaced by a double'.\n\nThe body double theory was backed up by head of Ukrainian military intelligence, who speculated that a Vladimir Putin body 'double' may have been used for his arrival at the Tehran summit.\n\nWhile the Russian leader looked awkward as he came down the steps of his presidential plane in Tehran, Ukrainian sources noted he moved unusually quickly and was more alert than in prior public appearances.\n\nThe Russian premier looked animated when greeting the waiting party, before removing his jacket and clambering into a heavily armoured limousine.\n\nIt was only the second time Putin had been abroad since launching his brutal invasion of Ukraine five months ago.\n\nThe General SVR channel has previously claimed that Putin is suffering from a series of serious illnesses including cancer, Parkinson's disease and a schizoaffective disorder.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_newman@dailymail.co.uk", "name": "Jack Newman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/29/12/60837919-0-image-a-9_1659095177222.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.7647058823529411, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 31, "stanza_neu": 67, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 99, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7132684016", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "14:27:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T14:27:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T13:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.729411780834198, "url": "https://journalstar.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/russia-ukraine-trade-blame-for-deadly-attack-on-pow-prison/article_15846313-2dba-5d4b-afc6-cf3acb933078.html", "title": "Russia, Ukraine trade blame for deadly attack on POW prison", "body": "By SUSIE BLANN - Associated Press\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia and Ukraine accused each other Friday of shelling a prison in a separatist region of eastern Ukraine, an attack that reportedly killed dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war who were captured after the fall of a key southern city in May.

An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the shelling as \"a deliberate, cynical, calculated mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners.\"\n\nNeither claim could be independently verified.\n\nVideo shot by The Associated Press showed charred, twisted bed frames in the wrecked barracks, as well as burned bodies and metal sheets hanging from the destroyed roof. The footage also included bodies lined up on the ground next to a barbed-wire fence and an array of what was claimed to be metal rocket fragments on a wooden bench.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the internationally unrecognized Donetsk republic, said the prison held 193 inmates. He did not specify how many were Ukrainian POWs.\n\nThe deputy commander of the Donetsk separatist forces, Eduard Basurin, suggested that Ukraine decided to strike the prison to prevent captives from revealing key military information.\n\nUkraine \"knew exactly where they were being held and in what place,\" he said. ''After the Ukrainian prisoners of war began to talk about the crimes they committed, and orders they received from Kyiv, a decision was made by the political leadership of Ukraine: carry out a strike here.\"\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called for a \"strict investigation\" into the attack and urged the United Nations and other international organizations to condemn it. He said the Russians had transferred some Ukrainian prisoners to the barracks just a few days before the strike, suggesting that it was planned.\n\n\"The purpose -- to discredit Ukraine in front of our partners and disrupt weapons supply,\" he tweeted.\n\nUkrainian officials alleged that Russia's Wagner Group, mercenaries Russia has used in other armed conflicts and reportedly elsewhere in Ukraine, carried out the assault.\n\nUkraine's security agency, the SBU, said it had intercepted phone calls that indicate Russian forces may have placed explosives in the prison, the agency said in a statement.\n\n\"In particular, none of the eyewitnesses heard any missile flying towards the correctional facility,\" the statement said. ''There was no characteristic whistling, and the explosions occurred on their own.\"\n\nIn addition, online video footage showed that the windows remained whole in some rooms of the facility, according to the SBU. That \"indicates that the epicenter of the explosion was inside the destroyed building, and its walls took the hit from the blast waves, protecting some of the neighboring rooms.\"\n\nA Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson, Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov, described the strike as a \"bloody provocation\" aimed at discouraging Ukrainian soldiers from surrendering. He too claimed that US-supplied HIMARS rockets were used, and said eight guards were among the wounded.\n\nUkrainian forces are fighting to hold on to the remaining territory under their control in Donetsk. Together with the neighboring Luhansk province, they make up Ukraine's mostly Russian-speaking industrial Donbas region.\n\nFor several months, Moscow has focused on trying to seize parts of the Donbas not already held by the separatists.\n\nHolding POWs in an area with active fighting appeared to defy the Geneva Convention, which requires that prisoners be evacuated as soon as possible after capture to camps away from combat zones.\n\nThe Ukrainian POWS at the Donetsk prison included troops captured during the fall of Mariupol.

An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the shelling as a \"a deliberate, cynical, calculated mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners.\"\n\nNeither claim could be independently verified.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the internationally unrecognized Donetsk republic, said the prison held 193 inmates. He didn't specify how many were Ukrainian POWs.\n\nThe deputy commander of the Donetsk separatist forces, Eduard Basurin, suggested that Ukraine decided to strike the prison to prevent captives from revealing key military information.\n\nUkraine \"knew exactly where they were being held and in what place,\" he said. \"After the Ukrainian prisoners of war began to talk about the crimes they committed, and orders they received from Kyiv, a decision was made by the political leadership of Ukraine: carry out a strike here.\"\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called for a \"strict investigation\" into the deadly attack and urged the United Nations and other international organizations to condemn it. He said the Russians had transferred some Ukrainian prisoners to the barrack that was hit just a few days before the strike, suggesting that it was planned.\n\n\"The purpose -- to discredit Ukraine in front of our partners and disrupt weapons supply,\" he tweeted.\n\nA Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson, Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, described the strike as a \"bloody provocation\" aimed at discouraging Ukrainian soldiers from surrendering. He too claimed that U.S.-supplied HIMARS rockets were used, and said eight guards were among the wounded.\n\nUkrainian forces are fighting to hold on to the remaining territory under their control in Donetsk, which together with neighboring Luhansk province makes up Ukraine's mostly Russian-speaking industrial Donbas region.\n\nFor several months of the war in Ukraine, Moscow has focused on trying to seize parts of the Donbas not already held by the separatists. Ukrainian authorities in the Donetsk region accused Russia on Friday of shelling civilian targets in Ukrainian-held areas.\n\n\"The fighting in the region has been intensifying by the day, and civilians must evacuate while it's still possible,\" Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said. \"The Russian army doesn't worry about civilian casualties. They are pummeling cities and villages in the region.\"\n\nHe later said one person was killed and five injured Friday in Russian rocket strike on the city of Kramatorsk.\n\nThe Ukrainian POWS at the Donetsk prison included troops captured during the fall of Mariupol. They spent months holed up with civilians at a giant steel mill in the southern port city. Their resistance during a relentless Russian bombardment became a symbol of Ukrainian defiance against Russia's aggression.\n\nMore than 2,400 soldiers from the Azov Regiment of the Ukrainian national guard and other military units gave up their fight and surrendered under orders from Ukraine's military in May.\n\nScores of Ukrainian soldiers have been taken to prisons in Russian-controlled areas. Some have returned to Ukraine as part of prisoner exchanges with Russia, but the families of other POWs have no idea whether their loved ones are still alive, or if they will ever come home.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- Ukraine's president visited one of Ukraine's main Black Sea ports a week after a deal was struck with Russia, Turkey and the United Nations to create safe corridors for ships to export grains that have been trapped in the country since the war began. Workers were seen preparing terminals for Ukraine's grain exports, which are relied on by millions of impoverished hungry people worldwide. Zelenskyy said the shipments would begin with the departure of several vessels that were already loaded but could not depart when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\n-- The Ukrainian presidential office said at least 13 civilians were killed and another 36 were wounded in Russian shelling over the last 24 hours. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, at least four people were killed and seven others were wounded when Russian shelling hit a bus stop. The Russian barrage also hit a facility that distributed humanitarian aid where three people were wounded, officials said. Ukrainian officials also said at least four civilians were killed and five wounded in the eastern town of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region.\n\n-- An appeals court in Kyiv on Friday reduced to 15 years the life sentence of a Russian soldier convicted in the first war crimes trial since Russia invaded Ukraine. Critics had said the sentencing of Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was unduly harsh given that he confessed to the crime and expressed remorse. He pleaded guilty to killing a civilian and was convicted in May. His defense lawyer argued that Shishimarin shot a Ukrainian man on the orders of his superiors.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

It accused the Russians of shelling the prison to cover up the alleged torture and execution of Ukrainians there.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said the competing claims and limited information prevented assigning full responsibility for the attack but the \"available visual evidence appears to support the Ukrainian claim more than the Russian.\"\n\nMoscow has opened a probe into the attack on the prison and the United Nations said it also was prepared to send investigators. U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said \"we stand ready to send a group of experts able to conduct an investigation, requiring the consent of the parties, and we fully support the initiatives\" of the Red Cross.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian rockets hit a school in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, overnight, and another attack occurred an hour later, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Saturday. There were no immediate reports of injuries.\n\nThe bus station in the city of Sloviansk also was hit, according to Mayor Vadim Lyakh. Sloviansk is near the front line of fighting as Russian and separatist forces try to take full control of the Donetsk region, one of two eastern provinces that Russia has recognized as sovereign states.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned Saturday that Ukrainian-controlled parts of the Donetsk region will face severe heating problems this winter because of the extensive destruction of gas mains. She called for a mandatory evacuation of residents before the cold weather sets in.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, one person was killed and six injured in shelling that hit a residential area in Mykolaiv, a port city, the regional government said.\n\nFriday's attack on the prison reportedly killed Ukrainian soldiers captured in May after the fall of Mariupol, a Black Sea port city where troops and the Azov Regiment of the national guard famously held out against a months-long Russian siege.\n\nOn Saturday, an association of Azov fighters' relatives dressed in black held a demonstration outside Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and called for Russia to be designated a terrorist state for violating the Geneva Convention's rules for the treatment of war prisoners.\n\nA woman wearing dark glasses who gave only her first name, Iryna, was waiting for news of her 23-year-old son.\n\n\"I don't know how is he, where is he, if he is alive or no. I don't know. It's a horror, only horror. For a mother, it's the biggest loss if her child has gone,\" she said.\n\nOn the energy front, Russia's state-owned natural gas corporation said Saturday it has halted shipments to Latvia because of contract violations. Gas giant Gazprom said the shipments were stopped because Latvia broke \"terms for extraction of gas.\" It did not elaborate.\n\nThe statement likely referred to a refusal to meet Russia's demand for gas payments in rubles rather than other currencies. Gazprom has previously suspended gas shipments to other EU countries, including the Netherlands, Poland and Bulgaria, because they would not pay in rubles.\n\nEU nations have been scrambling to secure other energy sources, fearing that Russia will cut off more gas supplies as winter approaches.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nTags Dcc Wire Apmediaapi Russia-ukraine-war Political Issues Political Imprisonment Government And Politics Local Governments Municipal Governments Russia Ukraine War General News War And Unrest Prisoners Of War Social Affairs Social Issues Human Welfare Treatment Of Prisoners Terrorism Oil And Gas Industry Business Energy Industry Get Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "dothaneagle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dothan Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@dothaneagle.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "susie_blann@dothaneagle.com", "name": "Susie Blann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dothaneagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/af/faf75e96-01dc-5397-af88-15c5e830a679/62e40f7ad464d.image.jpg?crop=1875%2C984%2C0%2C60&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 33, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 45, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7132614900", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "13:26:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T13:26:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T12:52:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "url": "https://worldcrunch.com/in-the-news/ukraine-russia-war-latest-news-prison-attack", "title": "War In Ukraine, Day 156: More Than 40 Ukrainian Prisoners Dead, Russia And Ukraine Blame Each Other", "body": "Russia and authorities in the occupied region of Donetsk say that more than 40 Ukrainian prisoners of war have been killed as well as at least 130 injured, after Ukrainian forces shelled a prison where they were being held.

U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said \"we stand ready to send a group of experts able to conduct an investigation, requiring the consent of the parties, and we fully support the initiatives\" of the Red Cross.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian rockets hit a school in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, overnight, and another attack occurred an hour later, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Saturday. There were no immediate reports of injuries.\n\nThe bus station in the city of Sloviansk also was hit, according to Mayor Vadim Lyakh. Sloviansk is near the front line of fighting as Russian and separatist forces try to take full control of the Donetsk region, one of two eastern provinces that Russia has recognized as sovereign states.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned Saturday that Ukrainian-controlled parts of the Donetsk region will face severe heating problems this winter because of the extensive destruction of gas mains. She called for a mandatory evacuation of residents before the cold weather sets in.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, one person was killed and six injured in shelling that hit a residential area in Mykolaiv, a port city, the regional government said.\n\nFriday's attack on the prison reportedly killed Ukrainian soldiers captured in May after the fall of Mariupol, a Black Sea port city where troops and the Azov Regiment of the national guard famously held out against a months-long Russian siege.\n\nOn Saturday, an association of Azov fighters' relatives dressed in black held a demonstration outside Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and called for Russia to be designated a terrorist state for violating the Geneva Convention's rules for the treatment of war prisoners.\n\nA woman wearing dark glasses who gave only her first name, Iryna, was waiting for news of her 23-year-old son.\n\n\"I don't know how is he, where is he, if he is alive or no. I don't know. It's a horror, only horror. For a mother, it's the biggest loss if her child has gone,\" she said.\n\nOn the energy front, Russia's state-owned natural gas corporation said Saturday it has halted shipments to Latvia because of contract violations. Gas giant Gazprom said the shipments were stopped because Latvia broke \"terms for extraction of gas.\" It did not elaborate.\n\nThe statement likely referred to a refusal to meet Russia's demand for gas payments in rubles rather than other currencies. Gazprom has previously suspended gas shipments to other EU countries, including the Netherlands, Poland and Bulgaria, because they would not pay in rubles.\n\nEU nations have been scrambling to secure other energy sources, fearing that Russia will cut off more gas supplies as winter approaches.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

There was no immediate confirmation of the attack from Ukraine.\n\nThe attack with HIMARS multiple rocket launchers on the prison in Olenivka, in the Russian-controlled Donetsk region, also injured 75 Ukrainian POWs, said Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov. Speaking before the latest update from the separatists, he put the death toll at 40.\n\nKonashenkov described the strike as a \"bloody provocation\" aimed at discouraging Ukrainian soldiers from surrendering. He said that eight prison guards were also wounded by the shelling.\n\nThe attack could not be independently verified and officials in Ukraine have not yet commented on the reports. Ukrainian authorities in the Donetsk region said Russia has pressed on with the shelling of civilian targets in Ukrainian-held areas.\n\n\"The fighting in the region has been intensifying by the day, and civilians must evacuate while it's still possible,\" said Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko. \"The Russian army doesn't worry about civilian casualties. They are pummeling cities and villages in the region.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian troops in Mariupol were taken prisoner after the fierce fighting for Ukraine's Azov Sea port, where they had been holed up at the giant Azovstal steel mill. Their resistance has become a symbol of Ukrainian struggle against the Russian invasion that started on Feb. 24.\n\nThe Azov Regiment and other Ukrainian units defended the steel mill for nearly three months, clinging to its underground maze of tunnels. More than 2,400 surrendered in May under relentless Russian attacks from the ground, sea and air.\n\nScores of Ukrainian soldiers were taken to prisons in Russian-controlled areas such as the Donetsk region, a breakaway area in eastern Ukraine which is run by Russian-backed separatist authorities. Some have returned to Ukraine as part of prisoner exchanges with Russia, but families of others have no idea whether their loved ones are alive, or if they will ever come home.\n\n-- Ukrainian officials said Russian forces shelled the country's second-largest city, Kharkiv.\n\nCity mayor Ihor Terekhov said a central part of the northeastern city was hit, including a two-story building and a higher education institution. Terekhov said the strike occurred just after 4 a.m. on Friday.\n\n\"The State Emergency Service is already working -- they are sorting out the rubble, looking for people under them,\" Terekhov said in a Telegram update.\n\n-- The Ukrainian presidential office said that at least 13 civilians were killed and another 36 were wounded in Russian shelling over the past 24 hours.\n\nIn the southern city of Mykolaiv, at least four people were killed and seven others were wounded when Russian shelling hit a bus stop.\n\n\"The Russians have changed their tactics because of the Ukrainian forces' successes in the south. ... They fire near a bus stop,\" Mykolaiv Gov. Vitaliy Kim said.\n\nThe Russian barrage also hit a facility for distribution of humanitarian assistance, where three people were wounded, officials said.\n\nUkrainian officials also said at least four civilians were killed and another five were wounded in the eastern town of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, which is the focus of the Russian offensive in the Donbas. More than 30 residential buildings and a kindergarten were damaged.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0274f31/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4598x2586+0+239/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F5b%2Fa627b6056bd35c40c276af6b842f%2F72b6f16039644de38dfde90479f99d13", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 17, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 31, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7132440779", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "11:02:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T11:02:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T10:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7098039388656616, "url": "https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/2022/07/29/ukraine-pows-die-in-russian-prison/", "title": "Moscow blames deaths of 40 POWs on Ukraine missile blitz", "body": "At least 40 Ukrainian prisoners of war captured during the fighting for Mariupol have been killed by Ukrainian shelling, according to Moscow's defence ministry -

They spent months holed up with civilians at a giant steel mill in the southern port city. Their resistance during a relentless Russian bombardment became a symbol of Ukrainian defiance against Russia's aggression.\n\nMore than 2,400 soldiers from the Azov Regiment of the Ukrainian national guard and other military units gave up their fight and surrendered under orders from Ukraine's military in May.\n\nScores of Ukrainian soldiers have been taken to prisons in Russian-controlled areas. Some have returned to Ukraine as part of prisoner exchanges with Russia, but the families of other POWs have no idea whether their loved ones are still alive, or if they will ever come home.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by phone to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in the highest-level known contact between the two sides since Russia invaded Ukraine.

Workers were seen preparing terminals for grain exports, which are relied on by millions of impoverished people worldwide. Zelenskyy said the shipments would begin with the departure of several vessels that were already loaded but could not leave when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\n-- The Ukrainian presidential office said at least 13 civilians were killed and another 36 wounded in Russian shelling over the last 24 hours. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, at least four people were killed and seven others wounded when Russian shelling hit a bus stop. The Russian barrage also hit a facility that distributed humanitarian aid where three people were wounded, officials said. Ukrainian officials also said at least four civilians were killed and five hurt in the eastern town of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region.\n\n-- An appeals court in Kyiv on Friday reduced to 15 years the life sentence of a Russian soldier convicted in the first war crimes trial since Russia invaded Ukraine. Critics had said the sentencing of Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was unduly harsh given that he confessed to the crime and expressed remorse. He pleaded guilty to killing a civilian and was convicted in May. His defense lawyer argued that Shishimarin shot a Ukrainian man on the orders of his superiors.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Russia's Defense Ministry on Saturday issued a list naming 48 Ukrainian fighters, their ages ranging from 20 to 62, who died in the attack; it was not clear if the ministry had revised its fatality count.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross, which has organized civilian evacuations in the war and worked to monitor the treatment of POWS held by Russia and Ukraine, said it has requested access to the prison \"to determine the health and condition of all the people present on-site at the time of the attack.\"\n\n\"Our priority right now is making sure that the wounded receive lifesaving treatment and that the bodies of those who lost their lives are dealt with in a dignified manner,\" the Red Cross said.\n\nBoth sides alleged the attack on the prison was premeditated and intended to silence the Ukrainian prisoners and to destroy evidence, including of possible atrocities.\n\nRussia claimed Ukraine's military used U.S.-supplied precision rocket launchers to target the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic.\n\nThe Ukrainian military, however, denied making any rocket or artillery strikes in Olenivka. It accused the Russians of shelling the prison to cover up the alleged torture and execution of Ukrainians there.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian rockets hit a school in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, overnight, and another attack occurred an hour later, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Saturday. There were no immediate reports of injuries.\n\nThe bus station in the city of Sloviansk also was hit, according to Mayor Vadim Lyakh. Sloviansk is near the front line of fighting as Russian and separatist forces try to take full control of the Donetsk region, one of two eastern provinces that Russia has recognized as sovereign states.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, one person was killed and six injured in shelling that hit a residential area in Mykolaiv, a significant port city, the region's administration said Saturday on Facebook.\n\nFriday's attack on the prison reportedly killed Ukrainian soldiers captured in May after the fall of Mariupol, a Black Sea port city where troops and the Azov Regiment of the national guard famously held out against a monthslong Russian siege.\n\nOn Saturday, an association of Azov fighters' relatives dressed in black held a demonstration outside Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and issued a statement calling for Russia to be designated a terrorist state for violating the Geneva Convention's rules for the treatment of war prisoners.\n\nA woman wearing dark glasses who gave only her first name, Iryna, was waiting for news of her 23 year-old-son.\n\n\"I don't know how is he, where is he, if he is alive or no. I don't know. It's a horror, only horror. For a mother, it's the biggest loss if her child has gone,\" she said.\n\nMoscow has opened a probe into the attack on POW prison, sending a team to the site from Russia's Investigative Committee, the country's main criminal investigation agency.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said the competing claims and limited information prevented assigning full responsibility for the attack but the \"available visual evidence appears to support the Ukrainian claim more than the Russian.\"\n\nOn the energy front, Russia's state-owned natural gas corporation said Saturday it has halted shipments to Latvia because of contract violations. Gas giant Gazprom said the shipments were stopped because Latvia broke \"terms for extraction of gas.\" It did not elaborate.\n\nThe statement likely referred to a refusal to meet Russia's demand for gas payments in rubles rather than other currencies. Gazprom has previously suspended gas shipments to other EU countries, including the Netherlands, Poland and Bulgaria, because they would not pay in rubles.\n\nEU nations have been scrambling to secure other energy sources, fearing that Russia will cut off more gas supplies as winter approaches.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk on Saturday warned that the parts of Donetsk region that remain under Ukrainian control will face severe heating problems this winter because of the extensive destruction of gas mains in the war.

Separatist authorities and Russian officials said the attack killed 53 Ukrainian POWs and wounded another 75.\n\nMoscow opened a probe into the attack, sending a team to the site from Russia's Investigative Committee, the country's main criminal investigation agency. The state RIA Novosti agency reported that fragments of U.S.-supplied precision High Mobility Artillery Rocket System rockets were found at the site.\n\nPeople are also reading...

An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the shelling as \"a deliberate, cynical, calculated mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners.\"\n\nNeither claim could be independently verified.\n\nVideo shot by The Associated Press showed charred, twisted bed frames in the wrecked barracks, as well as burned bodies and metal sheets hanging from the destroyed roof. The footage also included bodies lined up on the ground next to a barbed-wire fence and an array of what was claimed to be metal rocket fragments on a wooden bench.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the internationally unrecognized Donetsk republic, said the prison held 193 inmates. He did not specify how many were Ukrainian POWs.\n\nThe deputy commander of the Donetsk separatist forces, Eduard Basurin, suggested that Ukraine decided to strike the prison to prevent captives from revealing key military information.\n\nUkraine \"knew exactly where they were being held and in what place,\" he said. \"After the Ukrainian prisoners of war began to talk about the crimes they committed, and orders they received from Kyiv, a decision was made by the political leadership of Ukraine: carry out a strike here.\"\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called for a \"strict investigation\" into the attack and urged the United Nations and other international organizations to condemn it. He said the Russians had transferred some Ukrainian prisoners to the barracks just a few days before the strike, suggesting that it was planned.\n\n\"The purpose -- to discredit Ukraine in front of our partners and disrupt weapons supply,\" he tweeted.\n\nUkrainian officials alleged that Russia's Wagner Group, mercenaries Russia has used in other armed conflicts and reportedly elsewhere in Ukraine, carried out the assault.\n\nUkraine's security agencies issued a statement citing evidence that Russia was responsible, including the transfer of prisoners, analysis of injuries and the blast wave, intercepted phone conversations and the absence of shelling at the site.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\n\"All this leaves no doubt: The explosion in Olenivka was a Russian terrorist act and a gross violation of international agreements,\" the statement said.\n\nA Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson, Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, described the strike as a \"bloody provocation\" aimed at discouraging Ukrainian soldiers from surrendering. He too claimed that U.S.-supplied HIMARS rockets were used, and said eight guards were among the wounded.\n\nUkrainian forces are fighting to hold on to the remaining territory under their control in Donetsk. Together with the neighboring Luhansk province, they make up Ukraine's mostly Russian-speaking industrial Donbas region.\n\nFor several months, Moscow has focused on trying to seize parts of the Donbas not already held by the separatists.\n\nHolding POWs in an area with active fighting appeared to defy the Geneva Convention, which requires that prisoners be evacuated as soon as possible after capture to camps away from combat zones.\n\nThe Ukrainian POWS at the Donetsk prison included troops captured during the fall of Mariupol. They spent months holed up with civilians at a giant steel mill in the southern port city. Their resistance during a relentless Russian bombardment became a symbol of Ukrainian defiance against Russia's aggression.\n\nMore than 2,400 soldiers from the Azov Regiment of the Ukrainian national guard and other military units gave up their fight and surrendered under orders from Ukraine's military in May.\n\nScores of Ukrainian soldiers have been taken to prisons in Russian-controlled areas. Some have returned to Ukraine as part of prisoner exchanges with Russia, but the families of other POWs have no idea whether their loved ones are still alive, or if they will ever come home.\n\nIn other developments Friday:\n\n-- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by phone to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in the highest-level known contact between the two sides since Russia invaded Ukraine. Blinken urged Russia to accept a deal to win the release of American detainees Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan.\n\n-- Ukraine's president visited one of the country's main Black Sea ports a week after a deal was struck to create safe corridors for grain shipments that have been trapped in the country since the war began. Workers were seen preparing terminals for grain exports, which are relied on by millions of impoverished people worldwide. Zelenskyy said the shipments would begin with the departure of several vessels that were already loaded but could not leave when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\n-- The Ukrainian presidential office said at least 13 civilians were killed and another 36 wounded in Russian shelling over the last 24 hours. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, at least four people were killed and seven others wounded when Russian shelling hit a bus stop. The Russian barrage also hit a facility that distributed humanitarian aid where three people were wounded, officials said. Ukrainian officials also said at least four civilians were killed and five hurt in the eastern town of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region.\n\n-- An appeals court in Kyiv on Friday reduced to 15 years the life sentence of a Russian soldier convicted in the first war crimes trial since Russia invaded Ukraine. Critics had said the sentencing of Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was unduly harsh given that he confessed to the crime and expressed remorse. He pleaded guilty to killing a civilian and was convicted in May. His defense lawyer argued that Shishimarin shot a Ukrainian man on the orders of his superiors.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev posted a map on his Telegram channel depicting a Ukraine swallowed up by Russia and its neighbors.\n\nAlthough Russia's forces are trying to push deeper into the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, they have not been able to break through Ukrainian defenses, according to Ukrainian and Western officials.\n\n\"Throughout July, the occupiers have been trying to storm Donetsk region,\" Serhiy Haidai, head of the military administration in neighboring Luhansk province, said in a statement. But unlike with the Russians' push in the spring and early summer, when they could use their significant artillery advantage to flatten areas before advancing, Haidai said the Ukrainians' destruction of Russian ammunition depots had \"made it much more difficult for them to replenish arms stocks and maneuver.\"\n\nStill, he said, Russian forces continued \"to destroy settlements, employing barrel and jet artillery.\" At least six civilians were killed and 15 others were injured by Russian shelling in the Donetsk region Friday, local Ukrainian officials said.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned Saturday that Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donetsk will face severe heating problems this winter because of the destruction of gas mains. She called for a mandatory evacuation of residents before the cold weather sets in.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian rockets hit a school in Kharkiv and a bus station in Sloviansk, among other strikes.\n\nOn the southern front, at least one civilian in the port city of Mykolaiv died when a Russian missile struck a high-rise building overnight, according to Vitaliy Kim, the local governor.\n\nResidents of Nikopol -- a town just across the Dnieper River from Russian-controlled territory surrounding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant -- weathered another night of heavy shelling. The attack hit more than a dozen residential homes and caused a widespread power failure, according to local officials.\n\nThe Ukrainians have accused the Russians of using the nuclear power plant as a military base, assuming that the Ukrainians will not fire on it given the risks involved. But Ukrainian officials said Saturday that their country's military had hit Russian positions in the town where the plant is located, Enerhodar.\n\n\"It was really hot in Enerhodar, literally,\" the town's exiled mayor, Dmytro Orlov, said in a statement. He said three units of Russian military equipment, parked at the entrance to a local hotel, had been destroyed.\n\nWhile the Russians were working to repair a vital bridge over the Dnieper River farther south near the city of Kherson, the Ukrainians said it remained impassable and that Russian forces based on the western side of the river were largely isolated from resupply and support.\n\nRED CROSS BARRED\n\nUkrainian and Russian officials blamed each other Saturday for the deaths of dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war in an attack on a prison in a separatist-controlled area. The International Red Cross asked to visit the prison to make sure the scores of wounded prisoners of war had proper treatment, but said its request had not been granted so far.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Red Cross and United Nations have a duty to react to the shelling of the prison complex in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk province, and he called again for Russia to be declared a terrorist state.\n\n\"Condemnation at the level of political rhetoric is not enough for this mass murder,\" he said.\n\nSeparatist authorities and Russian officials said the attack Friday killed 53 Ukrainian POWs and wounded another 75. Russia's Defense Ministry on Saturday issued a list naming 48 Ukrainian fighters, ages 20 to 62, who died in the attack. It was not clear if the ministry had revised its fatality count.\n\nUkraine and Russia alleged the attack on the prison was premeditated and intended to silence the Ukrainian prisoners and destroy evidence.\n\nThe International Red Cross, which has organized civilian evacuations and worked to monitor the treatment of POWs held by Russia and Ukraine, said it requested access to the prison \"to determine the health and condition of all the people present on-site at the time of the attack.\"\n\n\"Our priority right now is making sure that the wounded receive lifesaving treatment and that the bodies of those who lost their lives are dealt with in a dignified manner,\" the Red Cross said.\n\nBut the organization said Saturday its request to access the prison had not been granted yet.\n\n\"Granting ICRC access to POWs is an obligation of parties to conflict under the Geneva Conventions,\" the International Red Cross wrote on Twitter.\n\nRussia claimed Ukraine's military used U.S.-supplied precision rocket launchers to target the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic.\n\nThe Ukrainian military accused the Russians of shelling the prison to cover up the alleged torture and execution of Ukrainians there.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said the competing claims and limited information prevented assigning full responsibility for the attack but the \"available visual evidence appears to support the Ukrainian claim more than the Russian.\"\n\nMoscow has opened a probe into the attack and the U.N. said it also was prepared to send investigators. U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said \"we stand ready to send a group of experts able to conduct an investigation, requiring the consent of the parties, and we fully support the initiatives\" of the Red Cross.\n\nThe prison attack reportedly killed Ukrainian soldiers captured in May after the fall of Mariupol, a Black Sea port city where troops and the Azov Regiment of the national guard famously held out against a months-long Russian siege.\n\nOn Saturday, an association of Azov fighters' relatives dressed in black demonstrated outside Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and called for Russia to be designated a terrorist state for violating the Geneva Convention's rules for the treatment of war prisoners.\n\nVIDEO OUTCRY\n\nMeanwhile, Amnesty International and the European Union have backed Kyiv in calling for an investigation into footage circulating online that appears to show pro-Russian forces castrating and executing a captive Ukrainian fighter.\n\nUkrainian officials pledged to identify the perpetrators after a series of gruesome videos recently surfaced on pro-Russian Telegram channels showing a group of men, one of them seen wearing pro-Russian symbols, castrating and executing a prisoner dressed in military fatigues with Ukrainian military insignia.\n\n\"This horrific assault is yet another apparent example of complete disregard for human life and dignity in Ukraine committed by Russian forces,\" Marie Struthers, Amnesty International's director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said Friday.\n\nIn a roughly 90-second-long video, a man dressed in military fatigues, wearing a \"Z\" patch and an orange-and-black ribbon associated with Russian forces, castrates the bound prisoner using a green utility knife.\n\nA separate video shared on pro-Russian Telegram channels shows a single shot being fired into the prisoner's head.\n\nThe Washington Post was unable to confirm the date or location of where the videos were filmed.\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak described the men in the footage as Russian \"propagandists\" delighting in torture.\n\n\"But the fog of war will not help to avoid punishment for the executioners,\" he tweeted. \"We will identify and get to each of you.\"\n\nThe Post was unable to identify the captive in the footage.\n\nThe EU's top diplomat described the footage as an example of the \"inhumane, barbaric acts\" that amount to war crimes.\n\n\"Evidence in form of appalling video footage has been widely shared on pro-Kremlin social networks today, in which Russian soldiers commit a heinous atrocity against a Ukrainian prisoner of war,\" Josep Borrell said Friday. \"The European Union condemns in the strongest possible terms the atrocities committed by the Russian armed forces and their proxies.\"\n\nThere has been no official comment from Moscow on the allegations.\n\nAmnesty's statement said the London-based rights group has documented crimes under international law during Russia's war on Ukraine, including summary killings of captives of Russian-backed separatists and extrajudicial executions of Ukrainian civilians by Russian forces.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Marc Santora of The New York Times, by Susie Blann of The Associated Press and by Dalton Bennett and Ellen Francis of The Washington Post.\n\nGallery: Images from Ukraine, month 6", "source": {"uri": "arkansasonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArkansasOnline"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/202007547_1A_AP_Ukraine_t600.jpg?4326734cdb8e39baa3579048ef63ad7b451e7676", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 16, "stanza_neu": 44, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 60, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7133901535", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-30", "time": "18:16:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-30T18:16:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-30T18:14:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "url": "https://roanoke.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/red-cross-requests-access-to-ukraine-prison-after-pows-die/article_81bbafa8-44be-5c8c-803e-8ddc8ced4f31.html", "title": "Red Cross requests access to Ukraine prison after POWS die", "body": "By SUSIE BLANN - Associated Press\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia launched nighttime attacks on several Ukrainian cities, Ukrainian officials said Saturday as they and Moscow blamed each other for the deaths of dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war in a separatist-controlled area of the country's east.

It accused the Russians of shelling the prison to cover up the alleged torture and execution of Ukrainians there.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian rockets hit a school in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, overnight, and another attack occurred an hour later, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Saturday. There were no immediate reports of injuries.\n\nThe bus station in the city of Sloviansk also was hit, according to Mayor Vadim Lyakh. Sloviansk is near the front line of fighting as Russian and separatist forces try to take full control of the Donetsk region, one of two eastern provinces that Russia has recognized as sovereign states.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, one person was killed and six injured in shelling that hit a residential area in Mykolaiv, a significant port city, the region's administration said Saturday on Facebook.\n\nFriday's attack on the prison reportedly killed Ukrainian soldiers captured in May after the fall of Mariupol, a Black Sea port city where troops and the Azov Regiment of the national guard famously held out against a monthslong Russian siege.\n\nOn Saturday, an association of Azov fighters' relatives dressed in black held a demonstration outside Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and issued a statement calling for Russia to be designated a terrorist state for violating the Geneva Convention's rules for the treatment of war prisoners.\n\nA woman wearing dark glasses who gave only her first name, Iryna, was waiting for news of her 23 year-old-son.\n\n\"I don't know how is he, where is he, if he is alive or no. I don't know. It's a horror, only horror.

Gas giant Gazprom said the shipments were stopped because Latvia broke \"terms for extraction of gas.\" It did not elaborate.\n\nThe statement likely referred to a refusal to meet Russia's demand for gas payments in rubles rather than other currencies. Gazprom has previously suspended gas shipments to other EU countries, including the Netherlands, Poland and Bulgaria, because they would not pay in rubles.\n\nEU nations have been scrambling to secure other energy sources, fearing that Russia will cut off more gas supplies as winter approaches.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk on Saturday warned that the parts of Donetsk region that remain under Ukrainian control will face severe heating problems this winter because of the extensive destruction of gas mains in the war. She called for a mandatory evacuation of residents of the region before the cold weather sets in.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

She called for a mandatory evacuation of residents before the cold weather sets in.\n\nThe prison attack reportedly killed Ukrainian soldiers captured in May after the fall of Mariupol, a Black Sea port city where troops and the Azov Regiment of the national guard famously held out against a months-long Russian siege.\n\nOn Saturday, an association of Azov fighters' relatives dressed in black demonstrated outside Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and called for Russia to be designated a terrorist state for violating the Geneva Convention's rules for the treatment of war prisoners.\n\nA woman wearing dark glasses who gave only her first name, Iryna, was waiting for news of her 23-year-old son.\n\n\"I don't know how is he, where is he, if he is alive or no. I don't know. It's a horror, only horror,\" she said.\n\nOn the energy front, Russia's state-owned natural gas corporation said Saturday it has halted shipments to Latvia because of contract violations. Gas giant Gazprom said the shipments were stopped because Latvia broke \"terms for extraction of gas.\"\n\nThe statement likely referred to a refusal to meet Russia's demand for gas payments in rubles rather than other currencies. Gazprom has previously suspended gas shipments to other EU countries, including the Netherlands, Poland and Bulgaria, because they would not pay in rubles.\n\nEU nations have been scrambling to secure other energy sources, fearing that Russia will cut off more gas supplies as winter approaches.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gazette.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "susie_blann@gazette.com", "name": "Susie Blann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/81/88100cbb-8c64-5107-a683-62d4c3a3bc41/62e40fda0e5a1.image.jpg?crop=1875%2C984%2C0%2C60&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.6470588235294117, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 24, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 35, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7132944053", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "18:37:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T18:37:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T18:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "url": "https://courthousenews.com/dozens-of-ukrainian-war-prisoners-killed-in-blast/", "title": "Dozens of Ukrainian war prisoners killed in blast", "body": "(CN) -- The war in Ukraine turned particularly gruesome on Friday after more than 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed and dozens more were wounded when a prison was struck by rocket fire during the night.\n\nVideos showed mangled prisoners' bodies strewn inside the destroyed Olenivka detention center. Ukraine and Russia traded blame for the attack. Russian media said the death toll had risen to 53 and that more than 75 prisoners were wounded. Eight prison guards were also wounded, according to Russia's defense ministry.\n\nHundreds of Ukrainian prisoners were being held in the prison south of Donetsk, an eastern Ukrainian city that has been under control of pro-Moscow separatists since 2014 when the war in Ukraine started following the overthrow of a pro-Russian Ukrainian president and the installation of a pro-Western government in Kyiv.\n\nMany of the prisoners killed in Olenivka were reportedly members of the Azov Regiment, a highly politicized and controversial branch of the Ukrainian army due to its links to the Ukrainian far-right nationalist movement. Azov prisoners face war crimes trials, long sentences and even potential execution in the self-declared republic of Donetsk.\n\nElsewhere in Ukraine, fighting remained fierce in eastern and southern parts of the country with reports that Russian and pro-Russian forces were making small advances in their campaign to capture the entire Donetsk region.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine's efforts to mount a counteroffensive in Kherson, a Black Sea region that fell under Russian control early in the invasion, showed little progress. In Kyiv and the West, there are high hopes that Ukrainian forces - aided by advanced Western weapons - can push Russian forces out of Kherson and other places on the Black Sea by the end of the year.\n\nIn other developments, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Odesa on Friday and announced vital grain shipments from Ukraine's ports were due to resume soon.\n\nUkraine and Russia reached a deal last week to allow cargo ships with grain and fertilizer from both countries safe passage through the Black Sea. Kyiv said shipments could start Friday or Saturday.\n\n\"It is important for us that Ukraine remains the guarantor of global food security,\" Zelenskyy said in Odesa. \"The first vessel, the first ship is being loaded since the beginning of the war. This is a Turkish vessel. This shows that the port has started working.\"\n\nThe resumption of grain and fertilizer shipments is seen as a crucial step in staving off food shortages in the poorest parts of the world. Ukraine and Russia are major food exporters and the war threatens to cause widespread famine. Food and energy prices continue to soar because of the war, putting a massive strain on the global economy.\n\nThe attack on the Olenivka prison, though, overshadowed the optimism over the resumption of cargo shipments.\n\nFollowing the attack, both sides traded bitter accusations and used the bloody episode to bring up allegations of war crimes.\n\nRussia alleged Ukraine wanted to kill the Azov prisoners awaiting trial because of recent releases of prisoner videos in which Ukrainian fighters talked about committing alleged war crimes. Such videos, though, are deemed highly untrustworthy because prisoners of war often speak to captors and make false confessions under duress.\n\nBut Russian media and military sources also charged that fragments of U.S.-supplied HIMARS rockets found at the prison proved that Ukraine was behind the attack.\n\nConversely, Ukrainian officials accused Russia of striking the prison to destroy evidence that Ukrainian prisoners were tortured and executed.\n\nIn the wake of the strike, Ukrainian sources also pointed to a newly released video that allegedly showed Russian soldiers castrating a Ukrainian prisoner with a utility knife. The video started circulating on Thursday on social media, according to the Moscow Times.\n\nThe attack on the prison came hours before Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken talked by telephone and discussed possible prisoner exchanges.\n\nThe White House is seeking the release of WNBA star Brittney Griner and another jailed American, Paul Whelan.\n\nGriner was arrested on drug-related charges at a Moscow airport in February and testified Wednesday at her trial. Griner acknowledged in court that she had vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage when she arrived in Moscow in February but contends she had no criminal intent and packed the cartridges inadvertently.\n\nWhelan, a corporate security executive from Michigan, was sentenced in 2020 to 16 years in prison on espionage charges.

They had been holed up at the giant Azovstal steel mill.\n\nTheir resistance has become a symbol of Ukraine's struggle against the Russian invasion that started on February 24.\n\nThe Azov Regiment and other Ukrainian units defended the steel mill for nearly three months, clinging to its underground maze of tunnels.\n\nMore than 2,400 surrendered in May under relentless Russian attacks from the ground, sea and air.\n\nScores of Ukrainian soldiers were taken to prisons in Russian-controlled areas such as the Donetsk region, a breakaway area in eastern Ukraine which is run by Russian-backed separatist authorities.\n\nSome have returned to Ukraine as part of prisoner exchanges with Russia, but families of others have no idea whether their loved ones are alive, or if they will ever come home.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited a Black Sea port on Friday as crews prepared terminals to export grain trapped by Russia's five-month-old war.\n\nIt comes a week after a deal was struck to allow critical food supplies to flow to millions of impoverished people facing hunger worldwide.\n\nHe said, however, that the departure of wheat and other grain will begin with several ships that were already loaded but could not leave Ukrainian ports after Russia invaded in late February.\n\nUkraine is a key global exporter of wheat, barley, corn and sunflower oil.\n\nThe loss of those supplies has raised global food prices, threatened political insecurity and helped push more people into poverty and hunger in already vulnerable countries.\n\nUkraine's military is committed to the safety of ships, Mr Zelenskyy said, adding that \"it is important for us that Ukraine remains the guarantor of global food security.\"\n\nHis unannounced visit to the port is part of a broader push by Ukraine to show the world that it is nearly ready to export millions of tons of grains after last week's breakthrough agreements, which were brokered by Turkey and the United Nations and signed separately by Ukraine and Russia.\n\nThe sides agreed to facilitate the shipment of wheat and other grains from three Ukrainian ports through safe corridors on the Black Sea, as well as fertiliser and food from Russia.\n\nBut a Russian missile strike on Odesa hours after signing the deal has thrown Moscow's commitment into question and raised new concerns about the safety of shipping crews, who also have to navigate waters strewn with explosive mines.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov emphasised the importance of maintaining a \"link between taking grain out of Ukrainian ports and unblocking direct or indirect restrictions on the export of our grain, fertilisers and other goods to global markets.\"\n\nThe security concerns and complexities of the agreements have set off a slow, cautious start, with no grains having yet left Ukrainian ports. The sides are facing a ticking clock -- the deal is only good for 120 days.\n\nThe goal over the next four months is to get some 20 million tons of grain out of three Ukrainian sea ports blocked since the February 24 invasion.\n\nThat provides time for about four to five large bulk carriers per day to transport grain from the ports to millions of people in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, who are already facing food shortages and, in some cases, famine.\n\nGetting wheat and other food out is also critical to farmers in Ukraine, who are running out of storage capacity amid a new harvest.\n\n\"We are ready,\" Ukraine's minister of infrastructure, Oleksandr Kubrakov, told reporters at the port of Odesa on Friday.\n\nBut he said Ukraine is waiting on the UN to confirm the safe corridors that will be used by ships navigating the waters.

The Russian side has used the prison camp in Olenivka, which is located inside DNR-controlled territory, to hold Ukrainian captives since the start of the February invasion -- including such high-profile POWs as the Ukrainian troops captured after the siege of Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant.\n\nThe authorities in Donetsk blamed the Ukrainian side for the strike, claiming that a US-made HIMARS missile system carried out a direct hit on one of the prison camp's barracks, killing 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war and injuring 75 others. The Russian Defense Ministry also claimed that the strike injured eight prison guards (the DNR's \"human rights commissioner\" Daria Morozova later reported that there were no injuries among the prison camp's personnel).\n\nFollowing the strike, the Russian Defense Ministry accused Ukraine of carrying out a \"blatant provocation,\" suggesting that the shelling was an act of \"intimidation\" meant to discourage Ukrainian soldiers from surrendering. DNR leader Denis Pushilin also accused Ukraine of deliberately striking the prison camp, alleging that the aim was to \"destroy\" captured soldiers from the Azov Regiment and thereby prevent them from \"testifying.\"\n\nIn turn, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces accused Russia of shelling the prison camp. In a statement, the Ukrainian General Staff said that the Russian military carried out a \"targeted artillery\" strike, in an attempt to frame Ukraine for war crimes and cover up \"the torture of prisoners and executions.\" The Ukrainian Armed Forces \"have never conducted and are not conducting shelling of civilian infrastructure, especially places where fellow prisoners of war are likely to be kept,\" the General Staff stated.\n\nWriting on Twitter, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the strike as a \"petrifying war crime\" and urged international partners \"to strongly condemn this brutal violation of international humanitarian law and recognize Russia [as] a terrorist state.\"\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak stated that \"there are no operational military targets for the Ukrainian army\" in Olenivka. \"The scale and speed of the information campaign by Russian propagandists indicate that this was a planned, organized act,\" Podolyak wrote on Telegram. \"We know that some of the captured defenders were moved to the barrack that was hit a few days before the crime. A classic, cynical, thought-out false flag operation.\" (According to DNR \"human rights commissioner\" Daria Morozova, Kyiv had insisted that Ukrainian POWs be transferred to the Olenivka prison.)\n\nAndrey Rudenko, a correspondent for the Russian state-owned broadcaster VGTRK, published footage apparently showing the damage from the strike. At first, former prisoners held in Olenivka told Mediazona Belarus that they didn't recognize the location in the video as part of the prison grounds. However, Rudenko later posted a second video, which two of the former prisoners said appeared to have been filmed at the prison.\n\nA few hours later, VGTRK posted a video that purportedly showed fragments of a HIMARS rocket. Where these fragments were filmed cannot be independently verified. However, the video also shows a Bible laying on a bench, which resembles one shown in Rudenko's second video.\n\nThe prison camp in Olenivka is located roughly 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the front. The DNR authorities regularly report that Ukrainian forces are shelling Horlivka, a city even closer to the front line located 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Olenivka prison camp. Olenivka is also situated on the outskirts of Yenakiieve, a city inside DNR-controlled territory that last came under shelling on June 13.\n\nUkrainian troops were also accused of shelling the Olenivka prison camp back in June. Ukrainian politician and pro-Kremlin blogger Anatoly Shariy (who is wanted in Ukraine for treason) wrote on Telegram on June 24 that the prison in Olenivka had been subjected to \"targeted shelling\" for two days straight.\n\nThat same day, a video appeared on Telegram in which Aiden Aslin -- a British national illegally sentenced to death by a proxy court in Donetsk after being captured while fighting as a Ukrainian marine in Mariupol -- said that Ukrainian troops were shelling the \"detention center in Donetsk\" where he was being held.

UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said \"we stand ready to send a group of experts able to conduct an investigation, requiring the consent of the parties, and we fully support the initiatives\" of the Red Cross.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian rockets hit a school in Kharkiv and a bus station in Sloviansk, among other strikes. In southern Ukraine, one person was reported killed and six injured in shelling in a residential area in Mykolaiv, local officials said.\n\nRussian and separatist forces are trying to take full control of the Donetsk region, one of two eastern provinces that Russia has recognised as sovereign states.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned Saturday that Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donetsk will face severe heating problems this winter because of the destruction of gas mains. She called for a mandatory evacuation of residents before the cold weather sets in.\n\nThe prison attack reportedly killed Ukrainian soldiers captured in May after the fall of Mariupol, a Black Sea port city where troops and the Azov Regiment of the national guard famously held out against a months-long Russian siege.\n\nOn Saturday, an association of Azov fighters' relatives dressed in black demonstrated outside Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and called for Russia to be designated a terrorist state for violating the Geneva Convention's rules for the treatment of war prisoners.\n\nA woman wearing dark glasses who gave only her first name, Iryna, was waiting for news of her 23-year-old son.\n\n\"I don't know how is he, where is he, if he is alive or no.

Lois \"Bunny\" Drueke, said her son, Alex Drueke, had been moved along with fellow U.S. captive Andy Huynh from one penal facility in the Donetsk region to another unspecified prison ahead of the rocket strike. It's not clear if Drueke and Huynh -- who were captured in Kharkiv in June -- were in the same prison camp that was struck but they are believed to have been in the same area until Thursday when they were mysteriously moved on the eve of the attack.\n\nTweeting on Friday, Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said of the prison bombing: \"Russia has committed another petrifying war crime by shelling a correctional facility in the occupied Olenivka where it held Ukrainian POWs.\" He added: \"I call on all partners to strongly condemn this brutal violation of international humanitarian law and recognize Russia a terrorist state.\"\n\nReports suggest that among the Ukrainian prisoners at the facility were fighters captured in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol after months of bitter fighting. The Azov Battalion and others kept hold of the site for three months in the face of relentless Russian bombardment.\n\nDozens of Ukrainian soldiers were detained and taken to Russian-controlled territories in the east of Ukraine, including Donetsk.\n\n\"It is with deep sadness that we are forced to confirm the information about the attack on the colony in Olenivka, where prisoners of the 'Azov' regiment are kept,\" a group that supports Ukrainian prisoners of war wrote on Telegram on Friday. The organization, called Azov Angels, added: \"We are finding out the names of the dead and injured through our channels.

REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko\n\nDozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war appeared to have been killed when a prison building was destroyed in a missile strike, with Moscow and Kyiv accusing each other on Friday of carrying out the attack.\n\nThe deaths, some of which were confirmed by Reuters journalists at the prison where the men were held, overshadowed U.N.-backed efforts to restart shipping grain from Ukraine and ease a looming global hunger crisis.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said 40 prisoners were killed and 75 wounded in the attack on the prison, in the frontline town of Olenivka, in a part of Donetsk province held by separatists.\n\nA spokesman for the separatists put the death toll at 53 and accused Kyiv of targeting the prison with U.S.-made HIMARS rockets. The ministry also said HIMARS rockets were to blame, Russian news agencies reported.\n\nUkraine's armed forces denied carrying out the strike, saying Russian artillery had targeted the prison to hide the mistreatment of those held there. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia had committed a war crime and called for international condemnation.\n\nReuters TV showed the remains of a cavernous burned-out building filled with metal beds, some with charred bodies lying on them while other bodies were lined up on military stretchers or on the ground outside.\n\nShell fragments had been laid out on a blue metal bench. It was not immediately possible to detect any identifying markings and it was not clear where the fragments had been collected.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said that the prison housed Ukrainian POWs and that eight prison staff were also wounded. Russian-backed separatist leader Denis Pushilin was quoted as saying there were no foreigners among the 193 detainees.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of atrocities and brutality against civilians during since its Feb. 24 invasion and said it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes. Russia denies targeting civilians.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence said Thursday's prison strike was a \"deliberate act of terrorism\". The domestic security agency said it had intercepted phone calls which point to Russia being responsible.\n\nUkraine's armed forces general staff said the prison attack was an attempt to shift blame.\n\n\"In this way, the Russian occupiers pursued their criminal goals - to accuse Ukraine of committing 'war crimes', as well as to hide the torture of prisoners and executions,\" it said.\n\nRussia has denied involvement in war crimes, accused Kyiv of staging them to smear its forces and said it is investigating Ukrainian war crimes.\n\nA spokesman for the Moscow-backed separatists told journalists in Olenivka that Ukraine had attacked after the prisoners of war had begun talking about crimes conducted by the Ukrainian military.\n\n\"The political leadership of Ukraine decided to use U.S.-producer multiple-launch rocket systems HIMARS to carry out a strike here to veil the crimes that the Ukrainian captives started talking about,\" spokesman Eduard Basturin said.\n\nThere was no way to immediately verify either of the two versions of events.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine said at least five people had been killed and seven wounded in a Russian missile strike on the southeastern city of Mykolaiv, a river port just off the Black Sea, as Russia fired across frontlines in eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\nRussia did not immediately comment on the situation.\n\nNews of the missile strike came as Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said Ukraine was ready to restart grain shipments from its southern ports.\n\nRussia and Ukraine agreed last week to unblock grain exports from Black Sea ports, which have been threatened by Russian attacks since the invasion.\n\nThe deal was the first diplomatic breakthrough of the conflict and wheat prices being offered in Asia slid this week on expectations of higher supplies.\n\nBut fierce fighting makes it extremely risky.\n\nKubrakov told reporters in the southern port of Odesa that the country was ready to ship grain from two ports under the U.N.-brokered agreement but that no dates had been set.\n\n\"In total, 17 ships were loaded before the war. Today we began the loading of another ship at Chornomorsk. We have, in principle, solved almost all technical questions,\" he said.\n\nHe said he hoped the first ships could leave port before the end of the week, while Bridget Brink, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said she hoped an agreement would be reached later on Friday to open the way for the first shipment.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his country was ready and awaiting a signal from the United Nations and Turkey to start the shipments.\n\nWhile the blockage of grain in Ukraine, one of the world's biggest exporters, has fed into global food price rises, shortages of Russian natural gas have raised energy prices in Europe and prompted fears of shortages over winter.\n\nMoscow, which describes its invasion of Ukraine as a \"special military operation\" conducted in self-defence, blames Western sanctions for the low gas supplies. Ukraine and its allies say the Russian assault was entirely unprovoked and have accused Moscow of energy blackmail.\n\nAn intelligence update from Britain said Russia had ordered mercenaries to hold sections of the frontline in Ukraine - a sign it is running short of combat infantry as Kyiv steps up a counter-offensive in the south.\n\nGreater reliance on fighters from the Russian private military company Wagner Group for frontline duties rather than their usual work in special operations would be another sign that Russia's military is under stress.\n\n\"This is a significant change from the previous employment of the group since 2015, when it typically undertook missions distinct from overt, large-scale regular Russian military activity,\" the ministry said.\n\nWagner and the Kremlin were not available for comment.\n\nUkraine's counter-attacks in the south come as Russia battles for control of the entirety of the industrialised Donbas region in the east.

There were no immediate reports of injuries.\n\nThe bus station in the city of Sloviansk also was hit, according to Mayor Vadim Lyakh. Sloviansk is near the front line of fighting as Russian and separatist forces try to take full control of the Donetsk region, one of two eastern provinces that Russia has recognized as sovereign states.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, one person was killed and six injured in shelling that hit a residential area in Mykolaiv, a significant port city, the region's administration said Saturday on Facebook.\n\nFriday's attack on the prison reportedly killed Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in May after the fall of Mariupol, another port city where troops famously held out against a monthslong Russian siege.\n\nMoscow opened a probe into the attack, sending a team to the site from Russia's Investigative Committee, the country's main criminal investigation agency. The state RIA Novosti agency reported that fragments of U.S.-supplied precision High Mobility Artillery Rocket System rockets were found at the site.\n\nThe Ukrainian military denied making any rocket or artillery strikes in Olenivka, and it accused the Russians of shelling the prison to cover up the alleged torture and execution of Ukrainians there.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said the competing claims and limited information prevented assigning responsibility for the attack but that the \"available visual evidence appears to support the Ukrainian claim more than the Russian.\"\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Both Kyiv and Moscow blame each other for the devastating explosion, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy calling it a \"deliberate mass killing\".\n\nThe newly built section of the prison held Ukrainian fighters from the Azovstal steel plant who had achieved worldwide fame for the defence of Mariupol during a brutal months-long siege. Although not yet confirmed to be by Russia, the attack has sparked outrage across Ukraine, particularly as the safety and evacuation of the Azovstal fighters was facilitated by the United Nations.\n\n\"I urge [the] UN which facilitated the evacuation of Ukrainian servicemen from Azovstal to strongly condemn Russia for shelling the Olenivka detention facility and visit the site to establish all facts of this heinous crime. I also call on ICRC to check all Ukrainian prisoners of war,\" Prime Minister of Ukraine Dymytro Kuelba tweeted.\n\nWith gruesome images from the attack going viral on social media, showing charred bodies on top of metal beds, Zelenskiy addressed citizens in the evening. He condemned the attack as a \"deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass killing of Ukrainian prisoners of war\", and called for a \"legal recognition of Russia as a state sponsoring terrorism\".\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for the Russian-backed separatists claims Ukraine attacked the prison, with pro-Russian media sharing footage of shrapnel allegedly from US-made HIMARS rockets at the site. HIMARS are medium-range rocket systems used by Ukrainian forces against Russian troops.\n\nThe footage has been widely shared by pro-Russian accounts as evidence of Ukraine's guilt. One Twitter user tweeted: \"Wreckage of HIMARS ammunition was found at the site of the strike on the colony with POW in Yelenivka [Olenivka]. If Ukraine received a piece of military equipment every time when its officials lie, it would be the greatest military power of all times\".\n\nKyiv has rejected these accusations. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence instead stated that Russia had destroyed the prison to cover up war crimes, labelling the attack a \"false flag operation\".\n\n\"With the barbaric overnight shelling in #Olenivka the Russian occupiers tried to destroy evidence and cover up the torture and execution of Ukrainian prisoners of war,\" the MoD tweeted.\n\nMoreover, a report from the Institute of the Study of War (ISW) analysed the video of the scorched prison shared by Kremlin-sponsored news outlet RIA Novosti and concluded that the damage seen in the video did not reflect the damage caused by a HIMARS strike.\n\n\"Available visual evidence appears to support the Ukrainian claim more than the Russian,\" the institute stated. \"But ISW cannot independently assess the nature of the attack or the party responsible for it at this time.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) claims to have intercepted phone calls confirming that Russian forces are to blame. The calls are currently being investigated and will be used as evidence in the relevant criminal proceedings, according to a statement from the SBU. The organisation believes that Russian forces staged a false flag operation and used explosives rather than rockets.\n\n\"Judging by the conversations of the militants, the Russians could have staged a tragedy due to the explosives they placed in the premises of the colony,\" the SBU stated. \"In particular, none of the eyewitnesses heard any rocket flying towards the correctional institution. There was no characteristic whistling, and the explosions occurred by themselves.\"\n\nWhilst there is still no concrete evidence backing Russia or Ukraine accusations, the European Union appears to be following Ukraine's line. The EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell condemned Russia for the attack, saying Moscow's actions constitute \"severe breaches of the Geneva conventions and their Additional protocol and amount to war crimes\", the Kyiv Independent reported.\n\nIn the meantime, the International Committee of the Red Cross has requested access to the site and offered to help with evacuations and donate medical supplies, protective equipment and forensic material.\n\nRussia has long been accused of committing war crimes in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion on February 24. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has been conducting an ongoing investigation into Russia's crimes and intends to instigate the first case this winter, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Council also launched an investigation into Russian human rights abuses in May after 33 countries voted in favour of investigating the horrific reports of crimes committed by Russian troops in order to hold the perpetrators to account.\n\nUkraine tried the first Russian soldier for war crimes in May. The soldier had shot and killed a Ukrainian civilian in the Sumy region on February 28. The total number of civilian deaths is unknown but it is likely to be far higher than the UN's official report of 5,024. However, Russia continues to deny it is targeting civilian areas despite massive evidence to the contrary.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on the West to designate Russia a state sponsor of terror after a horrific Russian missile attack on a packed shopping mall in Ukraine's industrial city of Kremenchuk last month. Ukrainian authorities confirmed there were no military targets in the vicinity and the strike was designed purely to inflict terror on Ukraine's civilian population.\n\nOne of the most disturbing events from the war so far was the massacre and rape of civilians in Bucha and other neighbouring settlements on the outskirts of Kyiv. At least 1,300 bodies were recovered, according to reports.\n\nThe massacre prompted Europe to implement further sanctions against Russia, including Latvia immediately announcing it would halt all Russian gas imports. Moreover, the atrocities led to Russia's suspension from the UN Human Rights Council after 93 countries voted in favour of its removal.", "source": {"uri": "intellinews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Intellinews                        "}, "authors": [], "image": "http://d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_desktop/s3/articleimages/OlenivkaprisonattackCropped_0_Cropped_(1).png", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.6235294117647059, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 29, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 41, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7133240348", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-30", "time": "02:59:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-30T02:59:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-30T02:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/30/prison-attack-that-killed-ukraine-pows-a-war-says-zelenskiy-amid-calls-for-un-inquiry", "title": "Prison attack that killed Ukraine PoWs a war crime, says Zelenskiy, amid calls for UN inquiry", "body": "Ukraine president says more than 50 people died, as Moscow and Kyiv accuse each other of being behind attack on prison in Russian-occupied Donetsk\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy has denounced as a war crime a prison attack that killed dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war in Russian-occupied Donetsk, as both sides traded blame for the deaths.\n\nIn a Friday night address, the Ukrainian president said more than 50 died in the assault on Olenivka, calling it \"a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war\".\n\nThe captured fighters - who Russia's defence ministry said included members of the Azov battalion, who defended the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol - should have been protected by guarantees secured by the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, said Zelenskiy, who joined his foreign minister in urging those organisations to intervene and investigate.\n\nOlenivka is about 10km south of occupied Donetsk and close to the frontline.

The country's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said earlier that Russia had committed a \"barbaric war crime\".\n\nUkraine's military intelligence said the strike was a \"deliberate act of terrorism\" and the domestic security agency, the SBU, said it had intercepted phone calls that pointed to Russia being responsible. Ukraine's prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said he had opened a war crimes investigation into the blast.\n\nThere was no way to immediately verify either of the two versions of events.\n\nFootage broadcast on Russian television said to be from the scene at the prison showed military personnel examining a building with a hole in the roof, tangled metal from bunk beds and blood trails among personal effects. Other images showed charred bodies and dismembered limbs.\n\nRussian media later published pictures of what it said were fragments from a US Himars rocket, gathered together and placed on what appeared to be a bench rather than located in situ.\n\nThe SBU claimed it had intercepted phone calls \"in which the occupiers confirm that Russian troops are to blame for this tragedy\". The intercepted conversations indicated the Russians may have placed explosives in the prison, the agency said in a statement. \"In particular, none of the eyewitnesses heard any missile flying towards the correctional facility. There was no characteristic whistling, and the explosions occurred on their own.\"\n\nIn addition, online video footage showed that the windows remained whole in some rooms of the facility, according to the SBU. That \"indicates that the epicentre of the explosion was inside the destroyed building, and its walls took the hit from the blast waves, protecting some of the neighbouring rooms.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called for a \"strict investigation\" into the attack and urged the UN and other international organisations to condemn it. He said the Russians had transferred some Ukrainian prisoners to the barrack just a few days before the strike, suggesting it was planned. The Russian allegations, he said, were \"a classic, cynical and elaborate false flag operation\" designed to discredit Ukrainian authorities.\n\nThe Azov regiment and other Ukrainian units defended the Azovstal steel mill for nearly three months, clinging to its underground maze of tunnels. They surrendered in May under relentless Russian attacks from the ground, sea and air.\n\nScores of Ukrainian soldiers were taken to prisons in Russian-controlled areas such as Donetsk, an area in eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatist authorities.\n\nSome have returned to Ukraine as part of prisoner exchanges with Russia, but families of others have no idea whether their loved ones are alive, or if they will ever come home.\n\nFriday's attack raises serious questions about where the prisoners were being held, in what circumstances, and why they had not been moved to a safer location.\n\nIt also raises questions about the status of those killed.

The Ukrainian military accused the Russians of shelling the prison to cover up the torture and execution of Ukrainians there.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said that full responsibility for the attack can't yet be assigned but that the \"available visual evidence appears to support the Ukrainian claim more than the Russian.\" Moscow has opened a probe, and the UN said it was prepared to send investigators.

REUTERS\n\n* Russia, Ukraine trade blame for prisoner deaths\n\n* UK says Russia deploys Wagner fighters more widely\n\n* Ukraine says grain ships loaded but no date yet to move\n\nDozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war appeared to have been killed when a prison building was destroyed in a missile strike on Friday, with Moscow and Kyiv accusing each other of carrying out the attack.\n\nThe deaths, some of which were confirmed by Reuters journalists at the damaged prison where the men were held, overshadowed UN-backed efforts to restart shipping grain from Ukraine and ease a looming global hunger crisis.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said 40 prisoners were killed and 75 wounded in the attack on the prison, in the frontline town of Olenivka, in a part of Donetsk province held by separatists.\n\nIt accused Kyiv of targeting it with US-made HIMARS rockets, Russian news agencies reported.\n\nUkraine's armed forces denied carrying out the strike, saying Russian artillery had targeted the prison to hide the mistreatment of those held there and lay the blame on Ukraine. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia had committed a war crime and called for international condemnation of the incident.\n\nReuters TV footage showed the remains of a cavernous burned-out building filled with metal beds, some with charred bodies still lying on them while other bodies were lined up on military stretchers or on the ground outside.\n\nShell fragments had been laid out on a blue metal bench, apparently so they could be photographed. It was not immediately possible to detect any identifying markings and it was not clear where the fragments had been collected from.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said that the prison housed Ukrainian prisoners of war and that eight prison staff were also wounded. Russian-backed separatist leader Denis Pushilin was quoted saying there were no foreigners among the 193 detainees.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has accused Russia of atrocities and brutality against civilians during the invasion and said it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes.\n\nIts armed forces general staff said the prison attack was an attempt to shift the blame.\n\n\"In this way, the Russian occupiers pursued their criminal goals - to accuse Ukraine of committing 'war crimes', as well as to hide the torture of prisoners and executions,\" it said.\n\nRussia has denied involvement in war crimes, accused Kyiv of staging them to smear its forces and said it is investigating Ukrainian war crimes.\n\nA spokesman for the Moscow-backed separatists told journalists in Olenivka that Ukraine had attacked after the prisoners of war had begun talking about crimes conducted by the Ukrainian military. There was no way to immediately verify either of the two versions of events.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine said at least five people had been killed and seven wounded in a Russian missile strike on the southeastern city of Mykolaiv, a river port just off the Black Sea, as Russia fired across frontlines in eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\nA missile struck near a public transport stop, regional governor Vitaly Kim said on Telegram.\n\nRussia, which denies targeting civilians, did not immediately comment on the situation.\n\nNews of the missile strike came as Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said Ukraine was ready to restart grain shipments from its southern ports.\n\nRussia and Ukraine agreed last week to unblock grain exports from Black Sea ports, which have been threatened by Russian attacks since it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nThe deal was the first diplomatic breakthrough of the conflict and wheat prices being offered in Asia slid this week on expectations of higher supplies.\n\nBut fierce fighting makes it extremely risky.\n\nKubrakov told reporters in the southern port of Odesa that the country was ready to ship grain from two ports under the UN-brokered agreement but that no date had been set for the first shipment to leave.\n\n\"In total, 17 ships were loaded before the war. Today we began the loading of another ship at Chornomorsk. We have, in principle, solved almost all technical questions,\" he said.\n\nHe said he hoped the first ships could leave port before the end of the week, while Bridget Brink, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said she hoped agreement would be reached later on Friday to open the way for the first shipment.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his country was ready and awaiting a signal from the United Nations and Turkey to start the shipments.\n\nUnited Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths said on Thursday the world body hoped poorer countries would get priority, citing Somalia, where nearly a quarter of a million people face starvation.\n\nWhile the blockage of grain in Ukraine, one of the world's biggest exporters, has fed into global food price rises, shortages of Russian natural gas have raised energy prices in Europe and prompted fears of shortages over winter.\n\nRussian gas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany remained at just 20% of capacity on Friday, after Russia halved the flows on Wednesday citing maintenance work.\n\nMoscow, which describes its invasion of Ukraine as a \"special military operation\" conducted in self-defence, blames Western sanctions for the low gas supplies. Ukraine and its allies say the Russian assault was entirely unprovoked and have accused Moscow of blackmail over its gas exports.\n\nAn intelligence update from Britain said Russia has ordered mercenaries to hold sections of the frontline in Ukraine - a sign it is running short of combat infantry as Kyiv steps up a counter-offensive in the south.\n\nGreater reliance on fighters from the Russian private military company Wagner Group for frontline duties rather than their usual work in special operations would be another sign that Russia's military is under stress.\n\n\"This is a significant change from the previous employment of the group since 2015, when it typically undertook missions distinct from overt, large-scale regular Russian military activity,\" the ministry said.\n\nWagner and the Kremlin were not available for comment.\n\nUkraine's counter-attacks in the south come as Russia battles for control of the entirety of the industrialised Donbas region in the east. It has already seized one of the two provinces, Luhansk, and is edging forward in Donetsk, where the prison struck on Friday lies southwest of the provincial capital.", "source": {"uri": "gulf-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gulf-Times"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.gulf-times.com/Content/Upload/Slider/720222917458719076514.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.6705882352941177, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 15, "stanza_neu": 31, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 46, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7132653361", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "13:59:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T13:59:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T13:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "url": "https://www.newser.com/story/323560/ukraine-russia-point-fingers-after-shelling-kills-pows.html", "title": "Ukraine, Russia Point Fingers After Shelling Kills POWs", "body": "(Newser) - Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine said Friday that a Ukrainian attack with US-supplied missiles on a separatist eastern region hit a prison and killed 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war who were captured in Mariupol -- but Ukraine blamed the attack on Russian forces.

That includes the invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, the Justice Department said Friday.\n\nAleksandr Viktorovich Ionov is accused of using groups in Florida, Georgia and California to spread pro-Kremlin talking points, with prosecutors accusing him of funding trips to Russia and paying for travel for conferences.\n\nHe is also charged with conspiring to have U.S. citizens act as illegal agents of the Russian government.\n\nAn appeals court in Kyiv on Friday reduced to 15 years the life sentence of a Russian soldier convicted in the first war crimes trial since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nCritics said the sentencing of Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old contract soldier who pleaded guilty of killing a civilian and was convicted in May, was unduly harsh. The soldier had confessed to the crime, expressed remorse and said he was following orders.\n\nHis lawyer had appealed to the court to reduce the sentence to 10 years. He said it was highly likely Shishimarin would be returned to Russia in a prisoner exchange.\n\nIn other news, the British Defense Ministry posted an intelligence update on Twitter Friday that said Russia, \"in a significant change,\" has handed over responsibility for portions of its frontline activities to the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company.\n\nThe post said the move makes it difficult for Russia to deny links between such companies and the Russian state. The measure was undertaken, according to the ministry, because Russia likely has \"a major shortage of combat infantry.\"", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_pike@globalsecurity.org", "name": "John Pike", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.6313725490196078, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 20, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 31, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7134080803", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-31", "time": "00:02:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-31T00:02:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-30T23:47:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.658823549747467, "url": "https://usanews-24.com/zelenskiy-wants-revenge-after-the-death-of-prisoners-of-war-politics", "title": "Zelenskiy wants revenge after the death of prisoners of war - Politics -", "body": "After the killing of dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war in a camp under Russian control, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced retaliation. It was a deliberate Russian war crime, the president said in a video message. He again called on the world community to officially classify Russia as a terrorist state. In view of Russia's mass attacks in Donbass, Zelenskyy called on residents to leave the area.\n\n\"There are hundreds of thousands of people in Donbas, tens of thousands of children, many refuse to leave,\" Zelenskyy said in an evening video address on Saturday. He called on the residents of Donbass to make this decision. \"Trust me,\" he said in a pleading tone. The more people leave the Donetsk region, the fewer people the Russian army can kill.\n\nPreviously, the Ukrainian government ordered a mandatory evacuation with the explanation that the citizens must take shelter before the start of the heating season, because the gas pipelines were destroyed by the war in the Donetsk region. Zelenskiy has now emphasized that everything is being organized so that people can escape from areas of the region that are still controlled by Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense in Moscow announced on Saturday the names of 50 dead and 73 wounded prisoners. They were held in a prison in the town of Olenivka, near Donetsk in the territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists. The rocket reportedly fell on the barracks on Friday evening. Russia blamed the hit on the precision American multi-barrel Himars rocket launchers used by the Ukrainian army.\n\nInformation provided by both parties could not be immediately verified; However, the first analyzes of images and videos raised doubts about the Russian version. The available optical material appears to support the Ukrainian position better than the Russian one, the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) wrote, without making a definitive commitment. \"Russia allegedly killed dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war,\" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borell said.\n\nAccording to the International Committee of the Red Cross, access to the prison in Olenivka was requested. They want to \"determine the health and condition of everyone who was present at the time of the attack.\" The Red Cross is offering assistance in evacuating the wounded and medical supplies, according to a statement issued on Saturday.\n\nAccording to Russian sources, there were 193 Ukrainian soldiers in prison. According to Ukraine's military intelligence service, \"the explosions took place in a newly constructed building specially prepared for Azovstal prisoners.\" Azovstal ironworks in Mariupol where Ukrainian soldiers hid before they gave up and were captured by the Russians. According to this information, soldiers of the Russian mercenary group Wagner blew up the barracks with prisoners.\n\nThe media showed pictures of a burned dormitory with corpses. Many bodies covered with tarpaulins were also lying in front of a building with large holes in the ceiling. One of the doubts about the Russian version is that there are no witnesses to the approach of the alleged Ukrainian missile. Only the prisoners were hit, not the guards from the so-called Donetsk People's Republic.\n\nPresident Selensky spoke of a \"terrorist attack carried out by Russian inhuman monsters\". \"The United Nations (UN) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which should guarantee the life and health of our prisoners of war, must react immediately,\" requested the head of state. In Kiev, the relatives of the captured soldiers asked for information about their fate.\n\nMeanwhile, the General Staff in Kyiv reported a large number of Russian attacks, including in the Kharkiv and Mykolaiv regions. The General Staff announced that the enemy had suffered heavy losses in the Donetsk region. Russian forces confirmed on Saturday that a Ukrainian base in the Kharkiv region was bombed by \"Iskander\" missiles.\n\nHowever, Western security experts saw signs that the Russian military was no longer making progress in its attacks. \"You're running out of breath...\" MI6 chief Richard Moore tweeted. Former American general David Petraeus believes that it is possible that Ukraine could return the territories occupied by Russia, he told \"Bild\".", "source": {"uri": "usanews-24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "usanews-24.com"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://usanews-24.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zelenskiy-wants-revenge-after-the-death-of-prisoners-of-war.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 34, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 38, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7132495713", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "11:47:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T11:47:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T11:44:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.658823549747467, "url": "https://www.kurv.com/russia-ukraine-trade-blame-for-shelling-of-pow-prison/", "title": "Russia, Ukraine Trade Blame For Shelling Of POW Prison", "body": "(AP) -- Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling a prison in a separatist eastern region that reportedly killed dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war who were captured after the fall of Mariupol in May.

The ministry also said HIMARS rockets were to blame, Russian news agencies reported.\n\nUkraine's armed forces denied carrying out the strike, saying Russian artillery had targeted the prison to hide the mistreatment of those held there. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia had committed a war crime and called for international condemnation.\n\nReuters TV showed the remains of a cavernous burned-out building filled with metal beds, some with charred bodies lying on them while other bodies were lined up on military stretchers or on the ground outside.\n\nShell fragments had been laid out on a blue metal bench. It was not immediately possible to detect any identifying markings and it was not clear where the fragments had been collected.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said that the prison housed Ukrainian POWs and that eight prison staff were also wounded. Russian-backed separatist leader Denis Pushilin was quoted as saying there were no foreigners among the 193 detainees.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of atrocities and brutality against civilians during since its Feb. 24 invasion and said it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes. Russia denies targeting civilians.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence said Thursday's prison strike was a \"deliberate act of terrorism\". The domestic security agency said it had intercepted phone calls which point to Russia being responsible.\n\nUkraine's armed forces general staff said the prison attack was an attempt to shift blame.\n\n\"In this way, the Russian occupiers pursued their criminal goals - to accuse Ukraine of committing 'war crimes', as well as to hide the torture of prisoners and executions,\" it said.\n\nRussia has denied involvement in war crimes, accused Kyiv of staging them to smear its forces and said it is investigating Ukrainian war crimes.\n\nA spokesman for the Moscow-backed separatists told journalists in Olenivka that Ukraine had attacked after the prisoners of war had begun talking about crimes conducted by the Ukrainian military.\n\n\"The political leadership of Ukraine decided to use U.S.-producer multiple-launch rocket systems HIMARS to carry out a strike here to veil the crimes that the Ukrainian captives started talking about,\" spokesman Eduard Basturin said.\n\nThere was no way to immediately verify either of the two versions of events.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine said at least five people had been killed and seven wounded in a Russian missile strike on the southeastern city of Mykolaiv, a river port just off the Black Sea, as Russia fired across frontlines in eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\nRussia did not immediately comment on the situation.\n\nGRAIN HOPES\n\nNews of the missile strike came as Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said Ukraine was ready to restart grain shipments from its southern ports.\n\nRussia and Ukraine agreed last week to unblock grain exports from Black Sea ports, which have been threatened by Russian attacks since the invasion.\n\nThe deal was the first diplomatic breakthrough of the conflict and wheat prices being offered in Asia slid this week on expectations of higher supplies.\n\nBut fierce fighting makes it extremely risky.\n\nKubrakov told reporters in the southern port of Odesa that the country was ready to ship grain from two ports under the U.N.-brokered agreement but that no dates had been set.\n\n\"In total, 17 ships were loaded before the war. Today we began the loading of another ship at Chornomorsk. We have, in principle, solved almost all technical questions,\" he said.\n\nHe said he hoped the first ships could leave port before the end of the week, while Bridget Brink, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said she hoped an agreement would be reached later on Friday to open the way for the first shipment.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his country was ready and awaiting a signal from the United Nations and Turkey to start the shipments.\n\nWhile the blockage of grain in Ukraine, one of the world's biggest exporters, has fed into global food price rises, shortages of Russian natural gas have raised energy prices in Europe and prompted fears of shortages over winter.\n\nMoscow, which describes its invasion of Ukraine as a \"special military operation\" conducted in self-defence, blames Western sanctions for the low gas supplies. Ukraine and its allies say the Russian assault was entirely unprovoked and have accused Moscow of energy blackmail.\n\nFOCUS ON SOUTH\n\nAn intelligence update from Britain said Russia had ordered mercenaries to hold sections of the frontline in Ukraine - a sign it is running short of combat infantry as Kyiv steps up a counter-offensive in the south.\n\nGreater reliance on fighters from the Russian private military company Wagner Group for frontline duties rather than their usual work in special operations would be another sign that Russia's military is under stress.\n\n\"This is a significant change from the previous employment of the group since 2015, when it typically undertook missions distinct from overt, large-scale regular Russian military activity,\" the ministry said.\n\nWagner and the Kremlin were not available for comment.\n\nUkraine's counter-attacks in the south come as Russia battles for control of the entirety of the industrialised Donbas region in the east. It has already seized one of the two provinces, Luhansk, and is edging forward in Donetsk, where the prison struck on Friday lies southwest of the provincial capital.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters bureaux; Writing by Stephen Coates, Philippa Fletcher and Nick Macfie; Editing by Angus MacSwan and Hugh Lawson)", "source": {"uri": "shorenewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shore News Network"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@shorenewsnetwork.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/Reuters_Direct_Media/USOnlineReportTopNews/tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXMPEI6S0QK-BASEIMAGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.6392156862745098, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 16, "stanza_neu": 30, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 46, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7134550427", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-31", "time": "12:56:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-31T12:56:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-31T12:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.658823549747467, "url": "https://lacrossetribune.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/red-cross-struggles-to-see-prison-where-ukrainian-pows-died/article_172bce06-6a43-572e-bbb3-7c360762e43d.html", "title": "Red Cross struggles to see prison where Ukrainian POWs died", "body": "By SUSIE BLANN - Associated Press\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukrainian and Russian officials blamed each other Saturday for the deaths of dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war in an attack on a prison in a separatist-controlled area.

Russia's Defense Ministry on Saturday issued a list naming 48 Ukrainian fighters, aged 20 to 62, who died in the attack; it was not clear if the ministry had revised its fatality count.\n\nSatellite photos taken before and after the attack show that a small, squarish building in the middle of the Olenivka prison complex was demolished, its roof in splinters.\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia alleged the attack on the prison was premeditated and intended to silence the Ukrainian prisoners and destroy evidence.\n\nThe ICRC, which has organized civilian evacuations and worked to monitor the treatment of POWs held by Russia and Ukraine, said it requested access to the prison \"to determine the health and condition of all the people present on-site at the time of the attack.\"\n\n\"Our priority right now is making sure that the wounded receive lifesaving treatment and that the bodies of those who lost their lives are dealt with in a dignified manner,\" the Red Cross said.\n\nBut the organization said late Saturday that its request to access the prison had not been granted yet.\n\n\"Granting ICRC access to POWs is an obligation of parties to conflict under the Geneva Conventions,\" the ICRC said on Twitter.\n\nRussia claimed Ukraine's military used U.S.-supplied precision rocket launchers to target the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic.\n\nThe Ukrainian military accused the Russians of shelling the prison to cover up the alleged torture and execution of Ukrainians there.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said the competing claims and limited information prevented assigning full responsibility for the attack but the \"available visual evidence appears to support the Ukrainian claim more than the Russian.\"\n\nMoscow has opened a probe into the attack and the U.N. said it also was prepared to send investigators. U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said \"we stand ready to send a group of experts able to conduct an investigation, requiring the consent of the parties, and we fully support the initiatives\" of the Red Cross.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian rockets hit a school in Kharkiv and a bus station in Sloviansk, among other strikes. In southern Ukraine, one person was reported killed and six injured in shelling in a residential area in Mykolaiv, local officials said.\n\nRussian and separatist forces are trying to take full control of the Donetsk region, one of two eastern provinces that Russia has recognized as sovereign states.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned Saturday that Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donetsk will face severe heating problems this winter because of the destruction of gas mains. She called for a mandatory evacuation of residents before the cold weather sets in.\n\nThe prison attack reportedly killed Ukrainian soldiers captured in May after the fall of Mariupol, a Black Sea port city where troops and the Azov Regiment of the national guard famously held out against a months-long Russian siege.\n\nOn Saturday, an association of Azov fighters' relatives dressed in black demonstrated outside Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and called for Russia to be designated a terrorist state for violating the Geneva Convention's rules for the treatment of war prisoners.\n\nA woman wearing dark glasses who gave only her first name, Iryna, was waiting for news of her 23-year-old son.\n\n\"I don't know how is he, where is he, if he is alive or no. I don't know. It's a horror, only horror,\" she said.\n\nOn the energy front, Russia's state-owned natural gas corporation said Saturday it has halted shipments to Latvia because of contract violations. Gas giant Gazprom said the shipments were stopped because Latvia broke \"terms for extraction of gas.\"\n\nThe statement likely referred to a refusal to meet Russia's demand for gas payments in rubles rather than other currencies. Gazprom has previously suspended gas shipments to other EU countries, including the Netherlands, Poland and Bulgaria, because they would not pay in rubles.\n\nEU nations have been scrambling to secure other energy sources, fearing that Russia will cut off more gas supplies as winter approaches.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

According to the Associated Press report, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and United Nations have a responsibility to respond after the jail complex in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region was shelled.\n\nIn addition to this, the International Red Cross requested to visit the jail to ensure that the numerous wounded POWs have been receiving the correct care, but they said their request had not yet been granted.\n\nAccording to separatist leaders and Russian officials, the attack took the lives of 53 Ukrainian POWs and 75 people injured. In a list published on Saturday, the Russian Defense Ministry listed 48 Ukrainian fighters who perished in the strike, ranging in age from 20 to 62. However, it was unclear if the ministry had updated its death toll.\n\nEmbattled President Zelenskyy further stated in a video speech, \"It was a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war,\" as per media reports. He also urged Kyiv's closest ally, the United States, to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. He concluded by calling the Biden administration to take immediate action to stop the aggressor from committing more war crimes.\n\n\"There should be a clear legal recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism,\" citing Zelenskyy, Associated Press reported. Besides this, the Ukrainian President even noted, \"Russia has proven with numerous terrorist attacks that it is the biggest source of terrorism in the world today. It's a fact\".\n\nMeanwhile, Russia claimed that the jail in Olenivka, a settlement under the control of the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic, was attacked by Ukrainian forces using precision rocket launchers provided by the United States. The military of Ukraine, however, has denied the launching of any artillery or missile attacks on Olenivka. In order to hide the alleged torture and execution of Ukrainian inmates there, it claimed that the Russians shelled the facility.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/zbryuo0epoxuixic_1659231023.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 15, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 19, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7132991831", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "19:34:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T19:34:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T19:33:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "url": "https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3539783-un-icrc-must-immediately-deploy-mission-in-olenivka-joint-statement-by-ukraine-officials.html", "title": "UN, ICRC must immediately deploy mission in Olenivka - joint statement by Ukraine officials", "body": "That's according to a joint statement released by the Ukrainian Ombudsman in relation to the mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war on July 29 in the village of Olenivka, Ukrinform reports.\n\n\"We demand that the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, which acted as guarantors of the lives and health of Ukrainian prisoners of war, immediately respond to the terrorist act committed by the Russian Federation,\" the statement emphasizes.\n\nIts authors demand that the inspection mission, consisting of the UN and ICRC officials, the Ukrainian Ombudsman, and representatives of the Joint Center for the Search and Release of Prisoners, be Donetsk region.\n\nAs recalled by the signatories, on the night of July 29, an explosion rocked the former correctional colony No. 210 in Olenivka, a settlement in the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region.

It is noted that, according to the Russian reports, more than 50 captured Ukrainian defenders were killed, while the number of wounded remains unclear.\n\nAccording to the comments issued by the Russian side, not a single penitentiary administration staffer, \"DPR\" militant, or Russian soldier guarding the premises was injured by the blast. \"Immediately after the explosion, Russia accused Ukraine of shelling a penal colony with American weapons and killing Ukrainian soldiers,\" the statement said.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian military and law enforcement, the explosion is a cynical terrorist act on the part of the Russian Federation, a military provocation, and a classic false flag operation, aimed to cover up war crimes, compromise the Armed Forces, disrupt the supply of Western weapons, and destabilize Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time, it is emphasized that the Ukrainian Army strikes target exclusively Russian military facilities: fuel, arms, and ammunition depots, command and control posts, and military infrastructure facilities.\n\nIt is noted that the Ukrainian Army has sufficient means to identify targets, including space reconnaissance systems, but Ukraine fired no missiles and artillery shells at Olenivka.\n\nAlso, the authors of the statement remind that the format of the Mariupol defenders' evacuation from the territory of the Azovstal plant provided for a ceasefire and surrender of the Ukrainian military as prisoners of war, with their subsequent exchange under the guarantees of the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nIt is noted that this format was chosen and approved by the Mariupol defenders, who took part in the negotiations. In particular, on June 29, the first of the scheduled swaps took place, as a result of which 144 Ukrainian servicemen returned to Ukraine, including 95 Azovstal defenders.\n\nThe key condition of the chosen format was for Russia to undertake commitment to international organizations regarding the preservation of the lives and health of Ukrainian defenders, military and law enforcement officials emphasized, and stated that this guarantee was cynically violated.\n\nIt is also stressed that multiple pieces of evidence testify to the pre-planned nature of the crime committed against Ukrainian POWs.\n\nIn particular, it is about the deliberate transfer of POWs to a new barrack shortly before the explosion occurred, the nature of the damage and the blast wave, invaders' communications intercepts, the absence of shelling traces in the specified location, and other evidence.\n\n\"All this leaves no doubt: the explosion in Olenivka was a Russian terrorist act and a gross violation of international agreements,\" the authors of the statement are convinced.\n\nAccording to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Russian military deliberately attacked the facility where Ukrainian POWs were held.\n\nThe General Staff decried the Kremlin's statements about the alleged shelling of civilian infrastructure and population by the Armed Forces of Ukraine as \"blatant lies and provocation.\"\n\nAccording to Ukrainian intelligence, the Ukrainian POWs could have been killed by mercenaries with the Wagner (Liga) Private Military Company, integrated into the Russian invasion forces.", "source": {"uri": "ukrinform.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ukrinform-EN"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.ukrinform.com/photos/2022_07/thumb_files/630_360_1659105980-402.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 5, "stanza_neu": 16, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 21, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7133064717", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "21:14:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T21:14:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T21:03:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "url": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/law-order/2127546-wrapup-11-russia-ukraine-trade-blame-for-dozens-of-deaths-in-donetsk-prison-destruction", "title": "WRAPUP 11-Russia, Ukraine trade blame for dozens of deaths in Donetsk prison destruction | Law-Order", "body": "Dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war appeared to have been killed when a prison building was destroyed in a missile strike or explosion, with Moscow and Kyiv accusing each other of responsibility on Friday. The deaths, some of which were confirmed by Reuters journalists at the prison where the men were held in eastern Donetsk province, overshadowed a U.N.-brokered deal to restart shipping grain from Ukraine and ease a worldwide food crisis.\n\nThe deal was discussed by the top diplomats of the United States and Russia on Friday in their first phone call since before Russia's invasion of its neighbour began on Feb. 24. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Washington was not living up to promises regarding the exemption of food from sanctions, the foreign ministry said. For his part Blinken said he told Lavrov the world expected Russia to fulfil its commitments under the grains agreement between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nForty prisoners were killed and 75 wounded at the prison in the frontline town of Olenivka held by Moscow-backed separatists, Russia's defence ministry said. A spokesman for the separatists put the death toll at 53 and accused Kyiv of targeting the prison with U.S.-made HIMARS rockets.\n\nUkraine's armed forces denied responsibility, saying Russian artillery had targeted the prison to hide the mistreatment of those held there. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia had committed a war crime and called for international condemnation. Reuters TV showed the remains of a cavernous burned-out building filled with metal beds, some with charred bodies lying on them while other bodies were lined up on military stretchers or on the ground outside.\n\nShell fragments had been laid out on a blue metal bench. It was not immediately possible to detect any identifying markings and it was not clear where the fragments had been collected. RED CROSS\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said the prison housed Ukrainian POWs and that eight prison staff were also wounded. Russian-backed separatist leader Denis Pushilin was quoted as saying there were no foreigners among the 193 detainees. Ukraine's security agencies demanded the United Nations and Red Cross immediately react to the deaths of prisoners of war in a Russian-held jail. They said the two organisations had given guarantees the detainees would be well treated and should send investigators to the prison.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is seeking access to the site and has offered to help evacuate the wounded, ICRC said in a statement on Friday. Ukraine has accused Russia of atrocities and brutality against civilians since its invasion and said it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes. Russia denies targeting civilians.\n\nUkraine's SBU domestic security agency said it had intercepted telephone calls by Russia-backed separatists which suggested Russian troops had caused an explosion at the prison. Ukrainian military intelligence said there was an explosion in a new building meant to house prisoners from the besieged Azovstal steel works in Mariupol. It said the building was blown up by mercenaries from Russian private military company Wagner Group and was not coordinated with the Russian Defence Ministry.\n\nHundreds of civilians and badly wounded Ukrainian soldiers were encircled and trapped for weeks in the Azovstal steelworks before they laid down their arms. The SBU said video footage online showed the windows in some rooms survived intact, suggesting there had been an explosion inside rather than shelling from outside.\n\nA spokesman for the Moscow-backed separatists told journalists that Ukraine had attacked the prison after the POWs had begun talking about crimes conducted by the Ukrainian military. \"The political leadership of Ukraine decided to use U.S.-producer multiple-launch rocket systems HIMARS to carry out a strike here to veil the crimes that the Ukrainian captives started talking about,\" spokesman Eduard Basturin said.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify the differing versions of events. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States did not yet have definitive information on what happened with the prison, but urged caution on what Russia was claiming given that past claims had proven to be false.\n\nRussia and Ukraine agreed last week to unblock grain exports from Black Sea ports, which have been threatened by Russian attacks since the invasion. The deal was the first diplomatic breakthrough of the conflict but fierce fighting makes it extremely risky.\n\nUkrainian Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov told reporters in the southern port of Odesa that the country was ready to ship grain from two ports under the agreement but that no dates had been set. He said he hoped the first ships could leave port before the end of the week.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/01_04_2019_17_12_02_6631371.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 15, "stanza_neu": 18, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 33, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7133079696", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "21:38:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T21:38:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T21:27:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/29/world/europe/ukraine-prison-russia-azov.html", "title": "Explosion Kills Dozens of Ukrainian Captives at Russian-Held Prison", "body": "ODESA, Ukraine -- For the Russians, the Ukrainian fighters held prisoner at Correctional Colony No. 210 are a trophy. For the Ukrainians, they are war heroes.\n\nWhy either side would want any of them dead is a mystery, but that is the question that hung over the fighting in Ukraine on Friday after another deadly episode, with each side accusing the other of committing a war crime.\n\nWhat is known is that an explosion ripped through a barracks of the prison camp in the Russian-occupied town of Olenivka in southeastern Ukraine early Friday morning, killing at least 50 captured fighters and maiming dozens more, according to both Ukrainian and Russian officials. Videos posted by Russian war bloggers show twisted metal bunk beds and the charred bodies of their former occupants.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said in a daily briefing on Friday that Ukraine had used an American-made advanced rocket system to strike the prison, aimed at sending a cautionary warning to Ukrainian soldiers who might be considering surrendering to Russian forces.\n\nUkrainian officials called those accusations absurd, charging that Russia caused the carnage to cover up atrocities they had committed at the prison. \"Russian occupiers are pursuing their criminal goals, accusing Ukraine of committing war crimes, while hiding the torture and shooting of prisoners,\" the Ukrainian general staff said in a statement.\n\nIt said that Ukraine used the new High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, exclusively to attack Russian military targets.\n\nUkrainian forces have successfully employed the Western-supplied rocket system to destroy Russian ammunition depots and command centers with high degrees of accuracy. The HIMARs have fired hundreds of satellite-guided rockets in Ukraine, and there have been no reports of them mistakenly hitting civilian targets.\n\nNeither side's claims about the explosion at the prison could be independently verified. But Russia has regularly blamed its own attacks on civilian targets on Ukraine -- including a strike in April that killed 50 people at a train station in Kramatorsk -- asserting with no evidence that Ukraine is conducting so-called false flag operations to make Russia look bad.\n\nA senior U.S. military official, speaking about the Russian assertions of a HIMARS attack on the camp, said: \"We have seen no evidence to back these claims whatsoever.\"\n\nOur Coverage of the Russia-Ukraine WarGrain Blockade: A breakthrough deal aims to lift a Russian blockade on Ukrainian grain shipments, easing a global food crisis. But in the fields of Ukraine, farmers are skeptical.An Ambitious Counterattack: Ukraine has been laying the groundwork to retake Kherson from Russia. But the endeavor would require huge resources, and could come at a heavy toll.Economic Havoc: As food, energy and commodity prices continue to climb around the world, few countries are feeling the bite as much as Ukraine.Inside a Siege: For 80 days, at the Avtostal steelworks, a relentless Russian assault met unyielding Ukrainian resistance. This is how it was for those who were there.\n\nThe prisoners held at the compound in Olenivka were not just any soldiers. An estimated 2,500 of them were fighters from the Azovstal Iron and Steel works in the city of Mariupol. Their 80-day battle against a vastly superior Russian force from bunkers beneath the mammoth factory has become legendary in Ukraine, with commanders' faces now seen on billboards around the country.\n\nTheir surrender in mid-May marked the end of one of the war's most brutal battles and handed Russia a significant victory, as well as a bargaining chip. Already, Ukraine and Russia have negotiated the exchange of 144 of the most seriously injured fighters and talks had been underway for another prisoner swap.\n\nRussian officials have provided no conclusive evidence to back up their claims that Ukraine struck the prison. A Kremlin-friendly war blogger posted video of twisted metal shrapnel he said was the remains of a HIMARS rocket. No Russian guards were killed or injured in the explosion, according to Russian officials.\n\nUkraine's intelligence agencies quickly weighed in. The domestic intelligence service, the SBU, published an audio recording Friday night of what the agency claimed were two Russian-backed separatist fighters discussing the explosion over the phone. In the call, which could not be independently verified, one person said there was no sound of any rocket before the explosion, and that Russian forces had likely blown up the barracks themselves.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, accused Russia of carrying out a \"carefully planned attack\" on the detention center, noting that there were no tactical military targets in the town of Olenivka. Russian forces had transferred Ukrainian soldiers to the barracks only several days before Friday's attack, he said.\n\n\"The Russians deliberately, cynically and intentionally murdered Ukrainian prisoners en masse,\" he said.\n\nIn a rare joint statement published on Friday night, Ukraine's intelligence services, the military and the human rights ombudsman called the attack \"an organized murder of Ukrainian prisoners\" and called on the United Nations and the International Red Cross to travel to Olenivka with Ukrainian officials to investigate.\n\nPrisoners who have been released from Correctional Colony No. 210 described hellish conditions. Guards provided just enough food for prisoners to survive and meted out regular beatings.\n\nVitaliy Sytnikov, a 35-year-old civilian who had been arrested while trying to evacuate other residents from Mariupol in March, described a disciplinary cell known as \"the pit.\"\n\n\"Almost every day we heard the beatings of prisoners of war there,\" Mr. Sytnikov said in a telephone interview, adding that most of the victims of such treatment were soldiers from Azovstal.\n\nJust before the Azovstal soldiers arrived in mid-May, two former prisoners said, the camp underwent a significant change. The separatist fighters who once stood guard were replaced by soldiers from Russia proper, and the separatists' rebel flag was taken down and replaced by the Russian tricolor flag; the changes were a testament to the new prisoners' importance.\n\nBut there was another significant change, according to Dmitriy Bodrov, 32, another civilian from Mariupol who was held at the camp. Russian soldiers began deploying near the barracks and firing off rockets in the direction of Ukrainian positions, seemingly trying to provoke Ukrainian forces into firing at the prison camp.\n\n\"Because of all that artillery, everything around was burning,\" Mr. Bodrov said.\n\nHe said that in the time before his release on July 4, Ukrainian forces had never hit the territory of camp.\n\nMr. Bodrov said that the industrial zone at the camp, where Friday's explosion occurred, had not previously been used to house prisoners. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the commander of Ukraine's military intelligence service said on Friday that construction of the barracks in that zone had been completed two days before and the prisoners moved there just before the explosion.\n\nBecause the Azov fighters were considered high value prisoners, it was unclear why Russia would want to kill them. In a statement, General Budanov offered one possible explanation saying the attack appeared to have been carried out by Russian mercenaries acting outside the regular chain of command. The Russian defense ministry, he said, appeared to have been caught by surprise and forced to make justifications for the attack after the fact.\n\nLate Friday evening, the Russian government indicated that there was no sorrow over the Ukrainian prisoners' loss. In a stinging post on Twitter, the Russian embassy in Britain said that fighters from the Azov Regiment, a unit that made up a large percentage of the Azovstal defenders, \"deserve execution, but death not by firing squad but by hanging, because they're not real soldiers. They deserve a humiliating death.\"\n\nThe Kremlin has a history of fabricating narratives to cover up potential war crimes. After a Russian antiaircraft system shot down a passenger airliner over Ukraine in 2014, the Kremlin contrived a series of exotic and ever changing explanations that never held up to expert scrutiny. At one point, Russian officials claimed that the aircraft, a Malaysia Airlines jumbo jet with 298 people onboard, was actually filled with corpses before take off.\n\nThe Ukraine war itself is premised on a Kremlin lie that Russian troops had been sent to liberate the country from a fascist junta that had established itself in Kyiv with the help of Western governments.\n\nThe attack this week came as video circulated online that appeared to show a Russian soldier castrating a Ukrainian prisoner of war and then shooting him in the head. Ukrainian officials have vociferously condemned the violence; the video's authenticity could not be independently confirmed.\n\nMichael Schwirtz reported from Odesa, Valerie Hopkins from Tivat, Montenegro, and Cora Engelbrecht from London.

We have, in principle, solved almost all technical questions,\" he said.\n\nHe said he hoped the first ships could leave port before the end of the week, while Bridget Brink, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said she hoped agreement would be reached later on Friday to open the way for the first shipment.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his country was ready and awaiting a signal from the United Nations and Turkey to start the shipments.\n\nUnited Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths said on Thursday the world body hoped poorer countries would get priority, citing Somalia, where nearly a quarter of a million people face starvation.\n\nWhile the blockage of grain in Ukraine, one of the world's biggest exporters, has fed into global food price rises, shortages of Russian natural gas have raised energy prices in Europe and prompted fears of shortages over winter.\n\nRussian gas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany remained at just 20% of capacity on Friday, after Russia halved the flows on Wednesday citing maintenance work.\n\nMoscow, which describes its invasion of Ukraine as a \"special military operation\" conducted in self-defence, blames Western sanctions for the low gas supplies. Ukraine and its allies say the Russian assault was entirely unprovoked and have accused Moscow of blackmail over its gas exports.\n\nAn intelligence update from Britain said Russia has ordered mercenaries to hold sections of the frontline in Ukraine - a sign it is running short of combat infantry as Kyiv steps up a counter-offensive in the south.\n\nGreater reliance on fighters from the Russian private military company Wagner Group for frontline duties rather than their usual work in special operations would be another sign that Russia's military is under stress.\n\n\"This is a significant change from the previous employment of the group since 2015, when it typically undertook missions distinct from overt, large-scale regular Russian military activity,\" the ministry said.\n\nWagner and the Kremlin were not available for comment.\n\nUkraine's counter-attacks in the south come as Russia battles for control of the entirety of the industrialised Donbas region in the east. It has already seized one of the two provinces, Luhansk, and is edging forward in Donetsk, where the prison struck on Friday lies southwest of the provincial capital.", "source": {"uri": "newsinfo.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@newsinfo.inquirer.net", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/files/2022/07/2022-07-29T071627Z_1_LYNXMPEI6S09V_RTROPTP_4_UKRAINE-CRISIS-ZAPORIZHZHIA-REGION-620x435.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.5686274509803921, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 15, "stanza_neu": 26, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 41, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7134034244", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-30", "time": "22:12:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-30T22:12:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-30T21:49:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "url": "https://nypost.com/2022/07/30/russia-silent-as-un-red-cross-want-access-where-ukrainian-pows-killed/", "title": "Russia silent as Red Cross, UN demand access to prison where dozens...", "body": "The United Nations and the Red Cross demanded access Saturday to the prison where dozens of Ukrainian POWs were killed, but Russia has so far met their requests with silence.\n\nThe UN wants to investigate the attack in the town of Olenivka in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine, which Moscow said killed 53 Ukrainian POWs and wounded another 75.\n\nUkraine maintains that Thursday night's deadly shelling was a \"war crime,\" while Russia claims Ukraine launched the missiles that destroyed the building.

He said the probe would require consent from all sides, and added that the UN supports the Red Cross' efforts to gain access to the site.\n\nThe prison housed nearly 200 troops captured in Mariupol, the scene of many of the war's worst atrocities, including many who held out in the Azovstal steel plant outside the city during weeks of brutal fighting.\n\nLate Saturday, Russia's Defense Ministry issued a list naming 48 Ukrainian fighters who died in the attack, aged 20 to 62. It was not immediately clear if the list was intended to be complete, suggesting that fewer people had died than initially stated, or if some names were missing.\n\nRussia has not yet said when and how the dead soldiers' bodies might be retrieved, Ukraine's Human Rights Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said.\n\n\"I have requested this information. So far, we have not yet received the lists.

Those findings could not be independently verified.\n\nThe think tank The Institute for the Study of War tweeted that \"available visual evidence appears to support Ukrainian claims more than those of the Russians.\"\n\nSeparately, the Ukrainian military said Saturday it had killed scores of Russian soldiers and destroyed two ammunition dumps in fighting in the Kherson region, the focus of Kyiv's counter-offensive in the south and a key link in Moscow's supply lines. It's used Western-supplied long-range missile systems to badly damage three bridges across the Dnipro in recent weeks, cutting off Kherson city, the first town captured by Russia after the Feb. 24 invasion.\n\nThe first deputy head of the Kherson regional council, Yuri Sobolevsky, told residents to stay from away from Russian ammunition dumps. \"The Ukrainian army is pouring it on against the Russians and this is only the beginning,\" Sobolevsky wrote on the Telegram app.\n\nThe strikes potentially further isolate Russian forces west of the river from supplies in occupied Crimea and the east. The UK Ministry of Defense said Russia has resorted to pontoon bridges and a ferry system to compensate for destroyed bridges.\n\nThe offensive is part of a broader Ukrainian effort to win back territory lost to Russia in the country's eastern and southern regions.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/red-cross-un-prison-killings-ukraine-99.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 8, "stanza_neu": 30, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 38, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7132324274", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "09:24:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T09:24:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T09:23:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "url": "https://www.trtworld.com/europe/live-blog-scores-of-mariupol-detainees-killed-in-prison-shelling-russia-59257", "title": "Live blog: Scores of Mariupol detainees killed in prison shelling - Russia", "body": "The Russian army accuses Ukraine's forces of striking a jail holding Ukrainian prisoners in pro-Moscow separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine, saying 40 people have died and scores suffered injuries on the 156th day of the offensive.\n\nRussia and separatists say shelling killed Ukrainian prisoners\n\nAt least 40 Ukrainian prisoners captured during the fighting for Mariupol have been killed by Ukrainian shelling, Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine have said.\n\nDaniil Bezsonov, a spokesperson for the separatists in the Donetsk region, said that at least 40 Ukrainian prisoners were killed and 130 were injured on Friday when Ukrainian shelling hit a prison in the town of Olenivka.

Russia's Defense Ministry on Saturday issued a list naming 48 Ukrainian fighters, aged 20 to 62, who died in the attack; it was not clear if the ministry had revised its fatality count.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross, which has organized civilian evacuations and worked to monitor the treatment of POWs held by Russia and Ukraine, said it requested access to the prison \"to determine the health and condition of all the people present on-site at the time of the attack.\"\n\n\"Our priority right now is making sure that the wounded receive lifesaving treatment and that the bodies of those who lost their lives are dealt with in a dignified manner,\" the Red Cross said.\n\nBut the organization said late Saturday that its request to access the prison had not been granted.\n\n\"Granting ICRC access to POWs is an obligation of parties to conflict under the Geneva Conventions,\" the ICRC said on Twitter. \"We will not stop seeking access to these POWs and to all POWs of this international armed conflict who we have not had access to yet.\"\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia alleged the attack on the prison was premeditated and intended to silence the Ukrainian prisoners and destroy evidence.\n\nRussia claimed Ukraine's military used U.S.-supplied precision rocket launchers to target the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic.\n\nThe Ukrainian military denied making any rocket or artillery strikes in Olenivka. It accused the Russians of shelling the prison to cover up the alleged torture and execution of Ukrainians there.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said the competing claims and limited information prevented assigning full responsibility for the attack but the \"available visual evidence appears to support the Ukrainian claim more than the Russian.\"\n\nMoscow has opened a probe into the attack on the prison and the United Nations said it also was prepared to send investigators. U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said \"we stand ready to send a group of experts able to conduct an investigation, requiring the consent of the parties, and we fully support the initiatives\" of the Red Cross.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian rockets hit a school in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, overnight, and another attack occurred an hour later, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Saturday. There were no immediate reports of injuries.\n\nThe bus station in the city of Sloviansk also was hit, according to Mayor Vadim Lyakh. Sloviansk is near the front line of fighting as Russian and separatist forces try to take full control of the Donetsk region, one of two eastern provinces that Russia has recognized as sovereign states.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned Saturday that Ukrainian-controlled parts of the Donetsk region will face severe heating problems this winter because of the extensive destruction of gas mains. She called for a mandatory evacuation of residents before the cold weather sets in.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, one person was killed and six injured in shelling that hit a residential area in Mykolaiv, a port city, the regional government said.\n\nFriday's attack on the prison reportedly killed Ukrainian soldiers captured in May after the fall of Mariupol, a Black Sea port city where troops and the Azov Regiment of the national guard famously held out against a months-long Russian siege.\n\nOn Saturday, an association of Azov fighters' relatives dressed in black held a demonstration outside Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and called for Russia to be designated a terrorist state for violating the Geneva Convention's rules for the treatment of war prisoners.\n\nA woman wearing dark glasses who gave only her first name, Iryna, was waiting for news of her 23-year-old son.\n\n\"I don't know how is he, where is he, if he is alive or no. I don't know. It's a horror, only horror. For a mother, it's the biggest loss if her child has gone,\" she said.\n\nOn the energy front, Russia's state-owned natural gas corporation said Saturday it has halted shipments to Latvia because of contract violations. Gas giant Gazprom said the shipments were stopped because Latvia broke \"terms for extraction of gas.\" It did not elaborate.\n\nThe statement likely referred to a refusal to meet Russia's demand for gas payments in rubles rather than other currencies. Gazprom has previously suspended gas shipments to other EU countries, including the Netherlands, Poland and Bulgaria, because they would not pay in rubles.\n\nEU nations have been scrambling to secure other energy sources, fearing that Russia will cut off more gas supplies as winter approaches.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Today we began the loading of another ship at Chornomorsk.

Ukraine and its allies say the Russian assault was entirely unprovoked and have accused Moscow of energy blackmail.\n\nMeanwhile, an intelligence update from Britain said Russia had ordered mercenaries to hold sections of the frontline in Ukraine - a sign it is running short of combat infantry as Kyiv steps up a counter-offensive in the south.\n\nGreater reliance on fighters from the Russian private military company Wagner Group for frontline duties rather than their usual work in special operations would be another sign that Russia's military is under stress.\n\n\"This is a significant change from the previous employment of the group since 2015, when it typically undertook missions distinct from overt, large-scale regular Russian military activity,\" the ministry said.", "source": {"uri": "gdnonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gulf Daily News Online"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.gdnonline.com/gdnimages/20220730\\20220730102141SAXoPicture-00000000088FCFB0-900348771.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.6784313725490196, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 18, "stanza_neu": 19, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 37, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7133448657", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-30", "time": "08:25:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-30T08:25:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-30T08:15:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "url": "https://bulgarianmilitary.com/2022/07/30/russia-showed-gmlrs-fragments-that-killed-the-ukrainian-pows/", "title": "Russia showed GMLRS fragments that killed the Ukrainian POWs", "body": "MOSCOW ($1=62.25 Russian Rubles) -- The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation released a video showing remnants and fragments of the GMLRS missiles used in the attack on the Yelenovka detention center. The Russian Defense Ministry also claimed that the Ukrainians killed were prisoners of war from the Ukrainian Azov Battalion.\n\nYesterday, Russia has accused the Ukrainian army of killing dozens of prisoners in an attack on a prison in the pro-Russian separatist-controlled Donetsk region. The Ministry of Defense in Moscow reported that 40 Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed and 75 others wounded in the shelling. The attack was carried out using one of the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems [HIMARS] that Ukraine received from the United States. There is no official statement on the accusations from the Ukrainian side.\n\n\"This gross provocation was carried out to intimidate Ukrainian servicemen and prevent their surrender,\" the MoD of the Russian Federation said in a statement.\n\nUkrainian soldiers were captured during the fierce fighting for the Ukrainian port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov. Ukrainian fighters have been hiding for months in the city's huge Azovstal metallurgical plant. The Ministry of Defense added that a large number of Ukrainian servicemen are currently voluntarily laying down their arms.\n\nUkraine, however, rejects the claims of the Russian Ministry of Defense, calling them propaganda and disobedience, and the Ukrainian Security Service claims that the destruction of the detention center was caused by an explosion inside the building, and not by a missile attack. \"None of the eyewitnesses heard rockets flying towards the penal colony, there was no characteristic whistling, and the explosions happened on the spot,\" the Ukrainian sources said.\n\nOn 21 February 2022, the Russian government claimed that Ukrainian shelling had destroyed an FSB border facility on the Russia Ukraine border, and claimed that it had killed 5 Ukrainian soldiers who tried to cross into Russian territory. Ukraine denied being involved in both incidents and called them a false flag.\n\nOn the same day, the Russian government formally recognized the self-proclaimed DPR and LPR as independent states, according to Putin not only in their de-facto controlled areas, but the Ukrainian Oblasts as a whole, and Putin ordered Russian troops, including tanks, to enter the regions.\n\nOn 24 February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine by Russian Armed Forces previously concentrated along the border. The invasion followed by targeted airstrikes of military buildings in the country, as well as tanks entering via the Belarus border.\n\nRussia has so far not recognized the invasion of Ukraine as a \"war\", although that is exactly what it is, claiming that it is a \"special military operation\". According to the UN, in which Russia has its permanent representation, for military action to be defined as a \"special military operation\", it must have a resolution issued by the UN. There is no such resolution, which automatically defines the military actions of the Russians as an invasion and war against the citizens of Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "bulgarianmilitary.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bulgarian Military Industry Review"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://bulgarianmilitary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Russia-showed-GMLRS-fragments-that-killed-the-Ukrainian-POWs.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.4745098039215686, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 9, "stanza_neu": 12, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 21, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7132335822", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "09:33:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T09:33:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T09:32:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "url": "https://shafaq.com/en/World/Russia-Says-Ukraine-POWs-Killed-by-Kyiv-Strikes-on-Jail", "title": "Russia Says Ukraine POWs Killed by Kyiv Strikes on Jail", "body": "Shafaq News / The Russian military and pro-Moscow separatists claimed Friday that Ukrainian forces shelled a prison in eastern Ukraine, killing at least 40 Ukrainian prisoners of war.\n\n\"Ukrainian security forces fired HIMARS rockets at a pre-trial detention center near Olenivka tonight,\" Russia's Defense Ministry said in a statement carried by state news agencies.\n\nIt said Ukrainian prisoners of war -- including members of the Azov Regiment who surrendered in May after defending the port city of Mariupol from within the besieged Azovstal steel plant -- were held at the Olenivka prison.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said 40 Ukrainian POWs were killed and 84 others wounded.\n\nAuthorities in the separatist Donetsk People's Republic placed the death toll at 53.\n\nUkrainian officials have not yet commented on Russia's claims.\n\nThe alleged attack using U.S.-supplied long-range missile systems comes amid Ukraine's active counteroffensive to retake two occupied southern regions.\n\nDenis Pushilin, head of the Donetsk People's Republic, claimed without evidence that the attack was a deliberate attempt to keep the Ukrainian soldiers from \"testifying\" for Donetsk's \"war crimes trial\" that Kyiv decries as a sham.\n\nUkrainian soldiers captured during five months of fighting are being held in Russian-controlled territories, with independent media reporting that some of them had been transferred to Moscow's notorious Lefortovo prison.", "source": {"uri": "shafaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0623\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0635\u0627\u0626\u0644 \u064a\u062d\u0631\u0642\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644\u064a \u0642\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0636\u0631\u0627\u0621 (\u0635\u0648\u0631)"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://media.shafaq.com/media/arcella/1659084134518.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.584313725490196, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 3, "stanza_neu": 7, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 10, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7133076262", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "21:33:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T21:33:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T21:02:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "url": "https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2022/07/29/russia-ukraine-trade-blame/", "title": "Russia, Ukraine trade blame for dozens of deaths in Donetsk prison destruction", "body": "ODESA, Ukraine/KYIV (Reuters) -Dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war appeared to have been killed when a prison building was destroyed in a missile strike or explosion, with Moscow and Kyiv accusing each other of responsibility on Friday.\n\nThe deaths, some of which were confirmed by Reuters journalists at the prison where the men were held in eastern Donetsk province, overshadowed a U.N.-brokered deal to restart shipping grain from Ukraine and ease a worldwide food crisis.\n\nThe deal was discussed by the top diplomats of the United States and Russia on Friday in their first phone call since before Russia's invasion of its neighbour began on Feb. 24.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Washington was not living up to promises regarding the exemption of food from sanctions, the foreign ministry said.

Russia's Defense Ministry on Saturday issued a list naming 48 Ukrainian fighters, aged 20 to 62, who died in the attack; it was not clear if the ministry had revised its fatality count.\n\nSatellite photos taken before and after the attack show that a small, squarish building in the middle of the Olenivka prison complex was demolished, its roof in splinters.\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia alleged the attack on the prison was premeditated and intended to silence the Ukrainian prisoners and destroy evidence.\n\nThe ICRC, which has organized civilian evacuations and worked to monitor the treatment of POWs held by Russia and Ukraine, said it requested access to the prison \"to determine the health and condition of all the people present on-site at the time of the attack.\"\n\n\"Our priority right now is making sure that the wounded receive lifesaving treatment and that the bodies of those who lost their lives are dealt with in a dignified manner,\" the Red Cross said.\n\nBut the organization said late Saturday that its request to access the prison had not been granted yet.\n\n\"Granting ICRC access to POWs is an obligation of parties to conflict under the Geneva Conventions,\" the ICRC said on Twitter.\n\nRussia claimed Ukraine's military used U.S.-supplied precision rocket launchers to target the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic.\n\nThe Ukrainian military accused the Russians of shelling the prison to cover up the alleged torture and execution of Ukrainians there.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said the competing claims and limited information prevented assigning full responsibility for the attack but the \"available visual evidence appears to support the Ukrainian claim more than the Russian.\"\n\nMoscow has opened a probe into the attack and the U.N. said it also was prepared to send investigators. U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said \"we stand ready to send a group of experts able to conduct an investigation, requiring the consent of the parties, and we fully support the initiatives\" of the Red Cross.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian rockets hit a school in Kharkiv and a bus station in Sloviansk, among other strikes. In southern Ukraine, one person was reported killed and six injured in shelling in a residential area in Mykolaiv, local officials said.\n\nRussian and separatist forces are trying to take full control of the Donetsk region, one of two eastern provinces that Russia has recognized as sovereign states.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned Saturday that Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donetsk will face severe heating problems this winter because of the destruction of gas mains. She called for a mandatory evacuation of residents before the cold weather sets in.\n\nThe prison attack reportedly killed Ukrainian soldiers captured in May after the fall of Mariupol, a Black Sea port city where troops and the Azov Regiment of the national guard famously held out against a months-long Russian siege.\n\nOn Saturday, an association of Azov fighters' relatives dressed in black demonstrated outside Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and called for Russia to be designated a terrorist state for violating the Geneva Convention's rules for the treatment of war prisoners.\n\nA woman wearing dark glasses who gave only her first name, Iryna, was waiting for news of her 23-year-old son.\n\n\"I don't know how is he, where is he, if he is alive or no. I don't know. It's a horror, only horror,\" she said.\n\nOn the energy front, Russia's state-owned natural gas corporation said Saturday it has halted shipments to Latvia because of contract violations. Gas giant Gazprom said the shipments were stopped because Latvia broke \"terms for extraction of gas.\"\n\nThe statement likely referred to a refusal to meet Russia's demand for gas payments in rubles rather than other currencies. Gazprom has previously suspended gas shipments to other EU countries, including the Netherlands, Poland and Bulgaria, because they would not pay in rubles.\n\nEU nations have been scrambling to secure other energy sources, fearing that Russia will cut off more gas supplies as winter approaches.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Ukraine and its allies say the Russian assault was entirely unprovoked.\n\nFocus on south\n\nAn intelligence update from Britain said Russia has ordered mercenaries to hold sections of the frontline in Ukraine - a sign it is running short of combat infantry as Kyiv steps up a counter-offensive in the south.\n\nGreater reliance on fighters from the Russian private military company Wagner Group for frontline duties rather than their usual work in special operations would be another sign that Russia's military is under stress.\n\n\"This is a significant change from the previous employment of the group since 2015, when it typically undertook missions distinct from overt, large-scale regular Russian military activity,\" the ministry said.\n\nWagner and the Kremlin were not available for comment.\n\nOfficials in Kyiv said on Wednesday they had observed a \"massive redeployment\" of Russian forces to the south where British defence officials believe Russia's 49th Army, stationed on the west bank of the Dnipro River, is vulnerable.\n\nUkraine's counter-attacks in the south come as Russia battles for control of the entirety of the industrialised Donbas region in the east, comprising the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@gulfnews.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "image": "https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2022/07/29/Ukraine-missile-strike_1824a54eb11_medium.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.6862745098039216, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 23, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 36, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7132796970", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "16:07:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T16:07:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T16:07:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "url": "https://albaniandailynews.com/news/ukraine-war-russia-and-ukraine-trade-blame-over-prison-blast", "title": "Ukraine War: Russia and Ukraine Trade Blame over Prison Blast", "body": "Ukraine War: Russia and Ukraine Trade Blame over Prison Blast\n\nRussia and Ukraine have blamed each other for a rocket attack that killed dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war in the occupied part of Donetsk region.

the sprawling Azovstal steel works in Mariupol.\n\nThe claims came as President Volodymyr Zelensky visited a port in southern Ukraine to oversee a ship being loaded with grain for export under a

[EPA-EFE/MYKOLA TYS]\n\nHaving no success on the battlefields, Russians decided to use massive terror as the intimidation instrument for reaching political goals, writes Roman Rukomeda.\n\nRoman Rukomeda is a Ukrainian political analyst. This is his 61st account of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe 158th day of war has come to an end. Last week Ukraine and the world witnessed new proof of Russian war crimes and terrorist acts.\n\nFirst, Russian war criminals tortured Ukrainian prisoners of war, and then they killed them before the video camera. A gruesome video of a Ukrainian soldier's nightmares and execution was widely published during the week.\n\nThere are different explanations for this atrocity. First, it is to intimidate all Ukrainian soldiers, officers, and society. But this is something we already saw in Bucha, Mariupol and others. The second reason is that the video might be aimed at possibly provoking Ukrainian soldiers to do the same with Russian war prisoners.\n\nFor this reason, Russians periodically shoot at the occupied Donetsk, killing civilian people, as they did last week while accusing the Ukrainian side. But even local people of occupied Donetsk realise that they are periodically shelled and bombarded by their Russian \"liberators\".\n\nRussia also tried to blame the destruction of a prison and the burning of the village of Olenivka on Ukrainians. But their claim was easily debunked as false. Since the attacks, Russia has refused to let international organisation representatives such as Red Cross or the UN go there to investigate the case. Neither do they allow the Ukrainian ombudsman to visit the place of the tragedy.\n\nSuch massive killing of war prisoners with signs of torture shall not be forgotten.\n\nAdditional examples of increased Russian terrorism during the week were the heavy attack on the south Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv. There, on 29 July, Russians shelled Mykolaiv with cluster munitions. They destroyed the school and damaged the university building and two residential buildings. At least seven civilians were killed.\n\nBesides, on Sunday, Russian aggressors attacked and killed Oleksiy Vadaturskiy - one of the most prominent Ukrainian agricultural businessmen engaged in the organisation of grain export from Ukraine. He was killed with his wife by a Russian rocket in his house during his sleep in the residential area of Mykolaiv. It was cold-blooded murder and an attempt to disorganise the export of Ukrainian grain abroad.\n\nOne more critical moment. Russia is using gas as a weapon against Europe now. They are openly blackmailing the EU and pressuring Europe.\n\nOf course, the first consequences of the EU life without Russian gas will be harrowing for many national economies and households. But this is the only way to get rid of dangerous dependency.\n\nIt is a shame for the international community to keep Russia in the UN (OSCE as well) and as one of the members of the UN Security Council.\n\nWe, Ukraine, Europe and all the free democratic world, need to show that there is no fear of Russian terrorism.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/Russia-ia-a-terrorist-state-800x450.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 21, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 34, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7132610130", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "13:22:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T13:22:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T13:22:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6196078658103943, "url": "https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/tanzania/news/africa/moscow-accuses-kyiv-of-pow-jail-strike-says-dozens-dead-3896218", "title": "Moscow accuses Kyiv of POW jail strike, says dozens dead", "body": "The Russian defence ministry said that the jail in Olenivka, in the separatist-held region of Donetsk, was targeted overnight.\n\nRussia and Moscow-backed separatists on Friday accused Kyiv's forces of striking a jail holding Ukrainian prisoners of war in eastern Ukraine, saying dozens of people died and scores were wounded.\n\nUkraine denied targeting civilian infrastructure or prisoners of war.\n\nAFP was not able to verify the reports.\n\n\"According to available information, the Ukrainian side shot at a detention centre where members of the Azov battalion were held, using American HIMARS launch rocket systems,\" Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement.\n\n\"As a result, several dozen people were killed,\" investigators said, adding that the exact toll was being clarified.\n\nThe Investigative Committee, which usually handles major crimes, said a criminal probe had been launched.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said that the jail in Olenivka, in the separatist-held region of Donetsk, was targeted overnight.\n\nThe defence ministry said 40 Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed and 75 wounded, adding that eight employees of the jail were also injured.\n\nDenis Pushilin, leader of the Donetsk separatists, put the death toll at 47 people.

In the fresh allegations, Russia has accused Kyiv of using US-made HIMARS to target its own war prisoners. Russian First Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations Dmitry Polyansky, took to the microblogging site and said Kyiv is making useless attempts to charge Moscow with an attack on a pre-trial detention centre. According to the diplomat, the Kyiv regime is trying to take revenge even on its military personnel, who realised the senselessness of carrying out criminal orders and surrendered to get a chance for redemption and peaceful life.\n\nFurther, he claimed such actions of intimidation will only spur the process of surrendering mobilised Ukrainians into captivity. \"We observe mass cases of refusal to fight on the part of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine every day,\" he said at the meeting of the UN Security Council on Ukraine. \"Dozens of eyewitnesses tell about this attitude of the Kyiv regime towards its people, who, unlike the so-called \"witnesses\" of Ukrainian and Western investigations, do not hide their names and addresses,\" he added.\n\nAt least 50 Ukrainian POWs were killed and more than 75 injured after a deadly attack on Friday. Amid facing backlash, Russia has invited various international humanitarian organisations to conduct an investigation. The major announcement from the Russian federation came as Ukrainian authorities repeatedly accused Moscow of the deadly attack on the POWs. Reacting to the repeated concerns and allegations, the Russian Defence Ministry invited experts from the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit the site and hold a probe in order to counter the Ukrainian claims, TASS News agency reported on Saturday.\n\nOn the other hand, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy termed the attack a \"deliberate war crime\" intended to kill the Ukrainian troops who reportedly surrendered during the Russian attack on Mariupol on the Azov Sea. Also, he urged the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross to act judiciously to safeguard Ukrainian POWs from further Russian attacks. According to Zelenskyy, Ukrainian diplomats brought the information about the Russian attack on Olenivka to the highest international level and added that all participants in international relations knew what really happened.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/pl9tlfu4qrgnilgn_1659256238.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 3, "stanza_neu": 12, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 15, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7132420425", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "10:44:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T10:44:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T10:44:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6196078658103943, "url": "https://en.haberler.com/over-50-ukrainian-prisoners-of-war-reportedly-1747392/?utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=tavsiye_et", "title": "Over 50 Ukrainian Prisoners Of War Reportedly Killed In Shelling", "body": "Russia claims Ukrainian attack carried out to deter servicemen from surrendering, but Ukraine denies allegation.\n\nOver 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed in an overnight attack on Friday at a pre-trial detention center in the Russia-controlled territory of Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, according to a local, Kremlin-aligned official.\n\nDenis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed \"Donetsk People's Republic,\" said the number of victims of the shelling rose to 53, up from an earlier Russian Defense Ministry figure of 40, Russian news agency Interfax reported.\n\nThe ministry also said 75 others were wounded in the attack, a claim denied by Kyiv.\n\nMost of those killed were captured at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, which fell to Russia after a long siege, said a ministry statement.\n\nThe Ukrainian attack was a \"deliberate bloody provocation\" meant to intimidate Ukrainian servicemen into not surrendering, the statement claimed,\n\nEight prison staffers were also injured in the attack.\n\nThe attack was carried out by a missile launched from US-supplied long-range High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), the statement added.\n\nA large number of Ukrainian servicemen have voluntarily surrendered in recent days after learning about Russia's \"humane attitude towards prisoners of war,\" the statement alleged.\n\nAnton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's Interior Ministry, denied the Russian account.\n\n\"All Russian media are full of claims that Ukraine made a rocket strike on prison in Elenovka near Donetsk \u00e2\u20ac\" where Ukrainian POWs were, mostly from Azovstal.

Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia had committed a war crime and called for international condemnation.\n\nReuters TV showed the remains of a cavernous burned-out building filled with metal beds, some with charred bodies lying on them while other bodies were lined up on military stretchers or on the ground outside.\n\nShell fragments had been laid out on a blue metal bench. It was not immediately possible to detect any identifying markings and it was not clear where the fragments had been collected.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said that the prison housed Ukrainian POWs and that eight prison staff were also wounded. Russian-backed separatist leader Denis Pushilin was quoted as saying there were no foreigners among the 193 detainees.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of atrocities and brutality against civilians during since its Feb. 24 invasion and said it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes. Russia denies targeting civilians.\n\nEXPLOSION OR SHELLING?\n\nUkraine's SBU domestic security agency said it had intercepted telephone calls by Russia-backed separatists which suggested Russian troops had caused an explosion at the prison. Ukrainian military intelligence said there was an explosion in a new building meant to house prisoners from the besieged Azovstal steel works in Mariupol.\n\nIt said the building was blown up by mercenaries from Russian private military company Wagner Group and was not coordinated with the Russian Defence Ministry.\n\nHundreds of civilians and badly wounded Ukrainian soldiers were encircled and trapped for weeks in the Azovstal steelworks before they laid down their arms.\n\nThe SBU said video footage online showed the windows in some rooms survived intact, suggesting there had been an explosion inside rather than shelling from outside.\n\nA spokesman for the Moscow-backed separatists told journalists that Ukraine had attacked the prison after the POWs had begun talking about crimes conducted by the Ukrainian military.\n\n\"The political leadership of Ukraine decided to use U.S.-producer multiple-launch rocket systems HIMARS to carry out a strike here to veil the crimes that the Ukrainian captives started talking about,\" spokesman Eduard Basturin said.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify the differing versions of events. Ukrainian public news network Suspilne quoted an ICRC spokesman in Ukraine as saying the agency had asked for urgent access.\n\nLAVROV DECRIES U.S. SANCTIONS\n\nNews of the prison deaths came as Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said Ukraine was ready to restart grain shipments from its southern ports.\n\nThe global food crisis is complicated by U.S. sanctions, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Antony in a phone call.\n\nA Russian foreign ministry read-out of the call also cited Lavrov as telling Blinken that Russia would achieve all the goals of its \"special military operation\" and said Western arms supplies to Ukraine would only drag out the conflict and multiply casualties.\n\nRussia and Ukraine agreed last week to unblock grain exports from Black Sea ports, which have been threatened by Russian attacks since the invasion.\n\nThe deal was the first diplomatic breakthrough of the conflict but fierce fighting makes it extremely risky.\n\nKubrakov told reporters in the southern port of Odesa that the country was ready to ship grain from two ports under the U.N.-brokered agreement but that no dates had been set.\n\nHe said he hoped the first ships could leave port before the end of the week, while Bridget Brink, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said she hoped an agreement would be reached later on Friday to open the way for the first shipment.\n\nWhile the blockage of grain in Ukraine, one of the world's biggest exporters, has fed into global food price rises, shortages of Russian natural gas have raised energy prices in Europe and prompted fears of shortages over winter.\n\nMoscow, which says its special operation is conducted in self-defence, blames Western sanctions for the low gas supplies. Ukraine and its allies say the Russian assault was entirely unprovoked and have accused Moscow of energy blackmail.\n\nAn intelligence update from Britain said Russia had ordered mercenaries to hold sections of the frontline in Ukraine - a sign it is running short of combat infantry as Kyiv steps up a counter-offensive in the south.\n\nGreater reliance on fighters from the Wagner Group for frontline duties rather than their usual work in special operations would be another sign that Russia's military is under stress.\n\n\"This is a significant change from the previous employment of the group since 2015, when it typically undertook missions distinct from overt, large-scale regular Russian military activity,\" the ministry said.\n\nWagner and the Kremlin were not available for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters bureaux; Writing by Stephen Coates, Philippa Fletcher and Nick Macfie; Editing by Angus MacSwan and Hugh Lawson)", "source": {"uri": "shorenewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shore News Network"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@shorenewsnetwork.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/Reuters_Direct_Media/USOnlineReportTopNews/tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXMPEI6S0QK-BASEIMAGE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.6470588235294117, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 19, "stanza_neu": 20, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 39, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7132555727", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "12:38:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T12:38:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T12:37:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.615686297416687, "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-russia-blame-strike-killing-prisoners-war-donetsk-rcna40587", "title": "Ukraine and Russia blame each other for strike reportedly killing dozens of POWs", "body": "A man stands at a destroyed marketplace in Bakhmut, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on Monday, as Russia continues air strikes on cities close to the Donetsk front line.Metin Aktas / Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nDozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war were feared dead on Friday as Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of carrying out a missile strike on a prison in Russian-controlled territory.\n\nRussia said Ukraine used a U.S.-supplied rocket system to hit a detention facility near the eastern front lines, killing at least 40 soldiers including some who had been captured after the fall of Mariupol in late May.

Separatist authorities and Russian officials said the attack killed 53 Ukrainian POWs and wounded another 75.\n\n\u25baThe International Committee of the Red Cross, which has organized civilian evacuations in the war and worked to monitor the treatment of prisoners of war held by Russia and Ukraine, said it has requested access to the prison attacked overnight \"to determine the health and condition of all the people present on-site at the time of the attack.\"\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said Friday there should no longer be any doubt that Russia intends to dismantle Ukraine \"and dissolve it from the world map entirely.\"\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield told the U.N. Security Council that the United States is seeing growing signs that Russia is laying the groundwork to attempt to annex all of the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk and the southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, including by installing \"illegitimate proxy officials in Russian-held areas, with the goal of holding sham referenda or decree to join Russia.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov \"has even stated that this is Russia's war aim,\" she said.\n\nLavrov told an Arab summit in Cairo on Sunday that Moscow's overarching goal in Ukraine is to free its people from its \"unacceptable regime.\"\n\nIn a letter to the United Nations, U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., on Friday called for the grain deal negotiated by the group to be halted until \"better security arrangements\" can be put in place for Ukraine.\n\n\"I am very disappointed with the lack of active U.N. leadership to stabilize the situation in Ukraine,\" Spartz wrote in the letter, which she sent to all other members of Congress and several top U.S. officials. \"The recent 'grain deal' is the latest failure.\"\n\nSpartz, who is the first and only Ukraine-born House member, cited a July 23 Russian attack on a Ukrainian grain port, which took place just hours after a deal had been struck with the nations to restart exports.

A Facebook post claimed Trump had a high-profile meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his brief visit.\n\nBut that's not true.\n\nPutin's last known trip to the U.S. was in 2015, when he addressed the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. Treasury Department in February announced sanctions against Putin, including blocking any of his U.S. \"property and interests in property.\"\n\nAccording to the Kremlin's website, Putin's most recent foreign visit was to Iran on July 19.

The sudden transfer of prisoners to a new location as well as telephonic conversations intercepted by Ukrainians would prove the Russian involvement, the statement said.\n\nElsewhere, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that Russia had \"effectively set the U.N. charter on fire.\"\n\nMoscow was reviewing plans to completely annex Kherson, Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia, in clear violation of the U.N. Charter and with a \"blatant disregard for the principles of national sovereignty,\" she said.\n\nHowever, in the Kherson region where Ukrainian forces have been mounting a counteroffensive in recent weeks, the country's military said Saturday it had killed scores of Russian soldiers and destroyed two ammunition dumps in the area. NBC News could not independently verify this claim.\n\nElsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian rockets hit a school building in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, overnight and another attack occurred about an hour later, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. There were no immediate reports of injuries.\n\nThe bus station in the city of Sloviansk was also hit, according to Mayor Vadim Lyakh. Sloviansk is near the front line of fighting as Russian and separatist forces try to take full control of the Donetsk region, which along with Luhansk is one of two eastern provinces that Russia has recognized as sovereign states.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, one person was killed and six injured in shelling that hit a residential area in Mykolaiv, a significant port city, the region's administration said.\n\nHowever, in a rare public statement Saturday, Richard Moore, the chief of Britain's MI6 foreign intelligence agency, said Russia was \"running out of steam.\"\n\nMoore made the remark above an earlier post on Twitter by the U.K.'s defence ministry, which described the Russian government as \"growing desperate\" and as having lost thousands of soldiers in its invasion of Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/socialshareimages-bento/og-nbcnews1680x840.png", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 9, "stanza_neu": 15, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 25, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7134006572", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-30", "time": "21:17:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-30T21:17:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-30T21:11:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6078431606292725, "url": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/law-order/2128376-red-cross-struggles-to-see-prison-where-ukrainian-pows-died", "title": "Red Cross struggles to see prison where Ukrainian POWS died | Law-Order", "body": "Ukrainian and Russian officials blamed each other for the deaths of dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war in an attack on a prison in a separatist-controlled area.

Russia's Defence Ministry on Saturday issued a list naming 48 Ukrainian fighters, aged 20 to 62, who died in the attack; it was not clear if the ministry had revised its fatality count.\n\nSatellite photos taken before and after the attack show that a small, squarish building in the middle of the Olenivka prison complex was demolished, its roof in splinters.\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia alleged the attack on the prison was premeditated and intended to silence the Ukrainian prisoners and destroy evidence.\n\nThe ICRC, which has organised civilian evacuations and worked to monitor the treatment of POWs held by Russia and Ukraine, said it requested access to the prison ''to determine the health and condition of all the people present on-site at the time of the attack.'' ''Our priority right now is making sure that the wounded receive lifesaving treatment and that the bodies of those who lost their lives are dealt with in a dignified manner,'' the Red Cross said.\n\nBut the organisation said late Saturday that its request to access the prison had not been granted yet.\n\n''Granting ICRC access to POWs is an obligation of parties to conflict under the Geneva Conventions,'' the ICRC said on Twitter. Russia claimed Ukraine's military used US-supplied precision rocket launchers to target the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic. The Ukrainian military accused the Russians of shelling the prison to cover up the alleged torture and execution of Ukrainians there.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said the competing claims and limited information prevented assigning full responsibility for the attack but the ''available visual evidence appears to support the Ukrainian claim more than the Russian.'' Moscow has opened a probe into the attack and the UN said it also was prepared to send investigators. UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said ''we stand ready to send a group of experts able to conduct an investigation, requiring the consent of the parties, and we fully support the initiatives'' of the Red Cross.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned Saturday that Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donetsk will face severe heating problems this winter because of the destruction of gas mains. She called for a mandatory evacuation of residents before the cold weather sets in.\n\nThe prison attack reportedly killed Ukrainian soldiers captured in May after the fall of Mariupol, a Black Sea port city where troops and the Azov Regiment of the national guard famously held out against a months-long Russian siege.\n\nOn Saturday, an association of Azov fighters' relatives dressed in black demonstrated outside Kyiv's St. Sophia Cathedral and called for Russia to be designated a terrorist state for violating the Geneva Convention's rules for the treatment of war prisoners. A woman wearing dark glasses who gave only her first name, Iryna, was waiting for news of her 23-year-old son. ''I don't know how is he, where is he, if he is alive or no. I don't know. It's a horror, only horror,'' she said.\n\nOn the energy front, Russia's state-owned natural gas corporation said Saturday it has halted shipments to Latvia because of contract violations. Gas giant Gazprom said the shipments were stopped because Latvia broke ''terms for extraction of gas.'' The statement likely referred to a refusal to meet Russia's demand for gas payments in rubles rather than other currencies. Gazprom has previously suspended gas shipments to other EU countries, including the Netherlands, Poland and Bulgaria, because they would not pay in rubles.\n\nEU nations have been scrambling to secure other energy sources, fearing that Russia will cut off more gas supplies as winter approaches.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

bombardment of the sprawling Azovstal steelworks in the port city of Mariupol.\n\nThe defence ministry said 50 Ukrainian prisoners were killed and 73 were taken to hospital with serious injuries.\n\n\"All political, legal and moral responsibility for this bloody massacre of Ukrainians lies with Zelenskyy personally, his criminal regime and Washington, which backs them,\" it

as President Volodymyr Zelensky visited a port in southern Ukraine to oversee a ship being loaded with grain for export under a UN-backed plan aimed at ending a food crisis.\n\nUkraine's presidency said exports could start in the \"coming days\" under the plan aimed at getting millions of tonnes of Ukrainian grain stranded by Russia's naval blockade to world markets.\n\nFollowing the strike on

spy chief says Russia is 'running out of steam'\n\n* Russia publishes list of killed, injured Ukrainian POWs\n\nBy Natalia Zinets and Pavel Polityuk\n\nKYIV, July 30 (Reuters) - The Ukrainian military said on Saturday it had killed scores of Russian soldiers in fighting in the south, including the Kherson region that is the focus of Kyiv's counter-offensive in that part of the country and a key link in Moscow's supply lines.\n\nRail traffic to Kherson over the Dnipro River had been cut, the military's southern command said, potentially further isolating Russian forces west of the river from supplies in occupied Crimea and the east.\n\nDefence and intelligence officials from Britain, which has been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies in the West since Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion, portrayed Russian forces as struggling to maintain momentum.\n\nUkraine has used Western-supplied long-range missile systems to badly damage three bridges across the Dnipro in recent weeks, cutting off Kherson city and - in the assessment of British defence officials - leaving Russia's 49th Army stationed on the west bank of the river highly vulnerable.\n\nThe Ukrainian military's southern command said more than 100 Russian soldiers and seven tanks had been destroyed in fighting in the south on Friday.\n\nThe first deputy head of the Kherson regional council, Yuri Sobolevsky, told residents to stay from away from Russian ammunition dumps.\n\n\"The Ukrainian army is pouring it on against the Russians and this is only the beginning,\" Sobolevsky wrote on the Telegram app.\n\nThe pro-Ukrainian governor of Kherson region, Dmytro Butriy, said Berislav district was particularly hard hit. Berislav is across the river northwest of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant.\n\n\"In some villages, not a single home has been left intact, all infrastructure has been destroyed, people are living in cellars,\" Butriy wrote on Telegram.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the reports.\n\nOfficials from the Russian-appointed administration running the Kherson region earlier this week rejected Western and Ukrainian assessments of the situation.\n\nIn an intelligence update on Saturday, Britain's defence ministry said Russia had likely established two pontoon bridges and a ferry system to compensate for bridges damaged in Ukrainian strikes.\n\nRussian-installed authorities in occupied territories in southern Ukraine were possibly preparing to hold referendums on joining Russia later this year, and were \"likely coercing the population into disclosing personal details in order to compose voting registers,\" it added.\n\nOn Friday the ministry described the Russian government as \"growing desperate\", having lost tens of thousands of soldiers in the war. The chief of Britain's MI6 foreign intelligence agency, Richard Moore, added https://twitter.com/ChiefMI6/status/1553309715299536896?s=20&t=ScC3FnVxfbtD1_W6tPFDvQ on Twitter that Russia is \"running out of steam\".\n\nPRISON DEATHS\n\nUkraine and Russia have traded accusations over a missile strike or explosion that appeared to have killed dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war in eastern Donetsk province. The incident took place early on Friday in the frontline town of Olenivka held by Moscow-backed separatists.\n\nRussia's defence ministry on Saturday published a list of Ukrainian prisoners of war who it said were killed and wounded in what it said was a missile strike by the Ukrainian military. It said the strike by U.S.-made HIMARS rockets had killed 50 prisoners and injured another 73.\n\nUkraine's armed forces denied responsibility, saying Russian artillery had targeted the prison to hide the mistreatment of those held there. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Friday Russia had committed a war crime and called for international condemnation.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify the differing versions of events, but some of the deaths were confirmed by Reuters journalists who visited the prison.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed his condolences over the deaths in a phone call on Friday with Kuleba, according to a State Department statement on Saturday.\n\nThe United States is committed to \"hold Russia accountable for atrocities committed by its forces against the people of Ukraine,\" Blinken told Kuleba.\n\nThe United Nations is prepared to send a group of experts to Olenivka to investigate the incident, if it gets consent from both parties, U.N. spokesperson Farhan Haq said. The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Friday it was seeking access to the site and had offered to help evacuate the wounded.\n\nRussian defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said on Saturday that \"all political, criminal and moral responsibility for the bloody massacre against Ukrainians falls on (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelenskiy, his criminal regime and Washington who supports them\".\n\nA charity linked to Ukraine's Azov regiment said on Telegram it was not immediately able to confirm or deny the authenticity of the Russian list of people killed and wounded.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of atrocities and brutality against civilians since its invasion and said it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes. Russia denies targeting civilians and has denied allegations of war crimes.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters bureaus Writing by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen Editing by Lincoln Feast, William Mallard and Frances

Donetsk region, the scene of fierce clashes with the Russian military, as Kyiv called on the Red Cross and U.N. to gain access to its soldiers being held by Moscow's forces.\n\nThe eastern Donetsk region has faced the brunt of Russia's offensive since its assault on Kyiv failed weeks into the invasion launched on February 24.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky warned in his daily address that thousands of people, including children, were still in the region's battleground areas, with six civilians killed and 15 wounded on Friday, according to the Donetsk governor.\n\n\"There's already a governmental decision about obligatory evacuation from Donetsk,\" Zelensky said, underscoring authorities' calls to leave the besieged region in recent weeks.\n\n\"Leave, we will help,\" Zelensky said. \"At this stage of the war, terror is the main weapon of Russia.\"\n\nOfficial Ukrainian estimates put the number of civilians still living in the unoccupied area of Donetsk at between 200,000 and 220,000.\n\nA mandatory evacuation notice posted Saturday evening said the coming winter made it a matter of urgency, particularly for the more than 50,000 children still in the region.\n\n\"They need to be evacuated, you cannot put them in mortal danger in the winter without heating, light, without the ability to keep them warm,\" Kyiv's Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories said in a statement.\n\nZelensky, in his address, also once more pressed the international community, especially the United States, to have Russia officially declared a \"state sponsor of terrorism\".\n\n- Deadly jail strike -\n\nThe call came a day after a jail holding Ukrainian prisoners of war in Kremlin-controlled Olenivka was bombed, leaving scores dead, with Kyiv and Moscow trading blame.\n\nOn Saturday, Ukrainian human rights official Dmytro Lubinets said on national television he had asked the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission to go to Olenivka.\n\nThe ICRC has made a request but not yet obtained authorization from the Russians, he said.\n\nRussia's defense ministry accused Kyiv of striking the Olenivka prison with U.S.-supplied long-range missiles in an \"egregious provocation\" designed to stop soldiers from surrendering.\n\nIt said Saturday that the dead included Ukrainian forces who had surrendered after weeks of fighting off Russia's brutal bombardment of the sprawling Azovstal steelworks in the port city of Mariupol.\n\nThe defense ministry said 50 Ukrainian prisoners were killed and 73 were taken to hospital with serious injuries.\n\nZelensky accused Russia of \"deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war.\"\n\n- Gazprom cuts off Latvia -\n\nAlso on Saturday, Russian energy giant Gazprom suspended gas supplies to Latvia in the latest tightening of gas provision to European Union states, which have accused Russia of squeezing supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nLatvia's Economy Minister Ilze Indriksone told the LETA news agency that his country \"was not counting on natural gas flows from Russia.\"\n\nGazprom drastically cut gas deliveries to Europe via the Nord Stream pipeline on Wednesday to about 20 percent of its capacity. It had reduced gas flows to Europe twice in June.\n\nThe Russian state-run company had earlier announced it would choke supply to 33 million cubic meters a day -- half the amount it has been delivering since service resumed last week after 10 days of maintenance work.\n\n- Drone attack -\n\nRussian strikes continued to rain down on Ukrainian towns and cities.\n\nUkrainian authorities said Russian bombardments targeting the south and east of the country had left one dead in southern Mykolaiv and one dead in eastern Bakhmut.\n\nThe death toll from a strike on a Mykolaiv bus stop on Friday climbed to seven after two men died in hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, in the eastern city of Kharkiv, three Russian S-300 missiles struck a school, mayor Igor Terekhov said on Telegram Saturday, adding that the main building was destroyed.\n\nBy early Sunday morning, Mykolaiv was again hit with \"massive shelling,\" according to its mayor.\n\n\"Probably the strongest of all time,\" Oleksandr Sienkevych said in a Telegram post.\n\n\"Powerful explosions were heard after 1 (am) at night and around 5 in the morning.

said that among the dead were Ukrainian forces that had laid down their arms after repelling Moscow's assault on the sprawling Azovstal steel works in Mariupol.\n\nThe claims came as President Volodymyr Zelensky visited a port in southern Ukraine to oversee a ship being loaded with grain for export under a UN-backed plan aimed at ending a food crisis.\n\nUkraine's presidency said exports could start in the \"coming days\" under the plan aimed at getting millions of tonnes of Ukrainian grain stranded by Russia's naval blockade to world markets.\n\n- 'Petrifying war crime' -\n\nFollowing the strike on the prison, Russian state-television showed what appeared to be destroyed barracks and tangled metal beds but no casualties could be seen.\n\nUkraine's military denied carrying out the attack saying its forces \"did not launch missile and artillery strikes in the area of Olenivka settlement.\"\n\nIt instead blamed Russia's invading forces for \"a targeted artillery shelling\" on the detention facility, saying it was being used to \"accuse Ukraine of committing 'war crimes', as well as to hide the torture of prisoners and executions\".\n\n\"Russia has committed another petrifying war crime by shelling a correctional facility in occupied\" Olenivka where it held Ukrainian POWs, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter.\n\nUkraine's forces in May ended a weeks-long siege of Azovstal, with around 2,500 combatants surrendering after calling a halt to their first resistance.\n\nMoscow's state media has reported that some officers -- including those from the controversial Azov regiment -- have been taken into Russia.\n\nKyiv says it has captured thousands of Russian troops during the invasion and has begun putting some on trial for alleged war crimes.\n\nA Ukrainian court on Friday reduced the life sentence handed to a Russian soldier in May for pre-meditated murder in the country's first war crimes trial, instead jailing the serviceman for 15 years.\n\n- Mykolaiv strikes -\n\nRussian strikes elsewhere in Ukraine killed five people and wounded seven more on Friday on the heavily bombed city of Mykolaiv near the country's southern frontline, the regional governor said.\n\n\"They shot at another area near a public transport stop,\" governor Vitaliy Kim said in a statement on social media.\n\nMykolaiv, near the Black Sea, has

Still, it mainly focused on shifting major combat operations to the south and Kherson.\n\n\"Over the last four days, Russia has continued to attempt tactical assaults on the Bakhmut axis, northeast of Donetsk, only managing to make slow progress,\" the British Military Intelligence assessed.\n\nThe Ukrainian Military Intelligence shared intelligence that indicates that the Russian military is relocating troops from the Donbas to Kherson to defend against the imminent Ukrainian counteroffensive there.\n\n\"As briefed by the Ukrainian authorities last week, Russia is likely reallocating a significant number of its forces from the northern Donbas sector to southern Ukraine,\" the British Ministry of Defense stated.\n\n\"Russia is probably adjusting the operational design of its Donbas offensive after failing to make a decisive operational breakthrough under the plan it had been following since April,\" the British Ministry of Defense added.\n\n\"It has likely identified its Zaporizhzhia front as a vulnerable area in need of reinforcement,\" the British Military Intelligence assessed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian forces keep targeting Russian ammunition depots and logistical hubs all along the southern front with their new High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and other long-range fires.\n\nRussian Casualties\n\nThe Russian forces continue to suffer heavy casualties in Ukraine, and their effectiveness is suffering because of it, making it harder to launch successful offensive operations.\n\nThe Ukrainian Ministry of Defense claimed that as of Monday, Ukrainian forces have killed approximately 41,030 Russian troops (and wounded approximately thrice that number), destroyed 223 fighter, attack, and transport jets, 190 attack and transport helicopters, 1,768 tanks, 932 artillery pieces, 4,011 armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles, 259 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS), 15 boats and cutters, 2,912 vehicles and fuel tanks, 117 anti-aircraft batteries, 736 tactical unmanned aerial systems, 82 special equipment platforms, such as bridging vehicles, and four mobile Iskander ballistic missile systems, and 174 cruise missiles shot down by the Ukrainian air defenses.\n\nWho Killed the Ukrainian Prisoners of War?\n\nOn July 28, an explosion at the Olenivka penal colony in Russian-occupied Ukraine killed scores and wounded dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war. Many of those killed or wounded were veterans of the battle of Mariupol and the epic action at the Azovstal steelworks plant.\n\nBoth sides have pointed the blame on the other. The Russians are claiming that the Ukrainian military launched a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) strike in order to dissuade any other Ukrainian troops from surrendering. But open-source intelligence indicates that the explosion doesn't share any characteristics with HIMARS strikes. So, thus far, the evidence points toward the Ukrainian claim that the explosion was committed by the Russians and was premeditated in order to hide evidence of war crimes.\n\nThe world has seen that the Russian forces in Ukraine have committed war crimes, including summary executions of civilians and prisoners of war, raping women of all ages, and last week a horrific video emerged showing Russian troops castrating a Ukrainian prisoner of war before they executed him.\n\n\"The Russian government may be complicating international efforts to discern the nature of an unidentified July 28 kinetic event on the Olenivka penal colony. The Russian Ministry of Defense officially invited experts from the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to investigate the attack at the Olenivka prison on July 30,\" the Institute for the Study of War stated in its latest operational update.\n\nBut the Russian authorities are delaying in grating access to the United Nations team. And the Ukrainian government has also stated that the Russian military has yet to respond to requests to return the remains of the killed prisoners of war. Moreover, open-source intelligence indicates that the Russian forces had prepared the strike and had even dug graves near the compound at least a few days before the explosion took place.", "source": {"uri": "19fortyfive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "19FortyFive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stavros_atlamazoglou@19fortyfive.com", "name": "Stavros Atlamazoglou", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.19fortyfive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Tanks-1024x576.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 17, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 24, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7133339321", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-30", "time": "05:56:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-30T05:56:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-30T05:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6039215922355652, "url": "https://www.mid-day.com/news/world-news/article/dozens-of-ukrainian-pows--believed-killed-in-missile-strike-23238505", "title": "Dozens of Ukrainian POWs  believed killed in missile strike", "body": "Russia's defence ministry said 40 prisoners were killed in the attack on a prison in a part of Donetsk province held by separatists, accuses Kyiv of targetting it\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky (right) talks to the Minister of Infrastructure Oleksander Kubrakov (left) during his visit to Black Sea port of Chornomorsk.

Forces of Ukraine, disrupt the supply of Western weapons and increase social tension in Ukrainian society,\" they said.\n\nUkrainian officials alleged that the feared Russian mercenary Wagner Group carried out the assault.\n\nOn the same day, UK intelligence noted how the private military company had been unusually active on the frontlines, acting as regular troops rather than its usual work in special missions.\n\n\"This is a significant change from the previous employment of the group since 2015,\" the UK report noted, saying it confirmed Wagner's close ties with the Kremlin and also appeared to prove Russia was suffering a \"shortage of combat infantry\" in its invasion.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "image":

HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) is the newest asset of the Florida Army National Guard's 3rd Battalion, 116th Field Artillery Regiment.\n\nDozens Of Ukrainian POWs Killed in Blast, Russia, Ukraine Accuse Each Other - An attack on a POW camp in a Russian-proxy-held area of eastern Ukraine has killed dozens of Ukrainian POWs, many of whom were captured after the siege of the Black Sea port of Mariupol.\n\nEach side accused the other of a deliberate attack on the POW camp (Collection Colony No. 120) in Olenivka, which is controlled by the Russian-backed so-called Donetsk People's Republic, in an attempt to cover up atrocities and war crimes.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is seeking access to the site and has offered to help evacuate the wounded. A spokesman for the DPR put the death toll at 53.\n\n\"The ICRC has offered its support in the evacuation of the wounded and to donate medical supplies, protective equipment, and forensic material.

We are also in contact with families, taking their requests and inquiries.\"\n\nRussia Accuses Ukraine of Using HIMARS Missile to Target Camp:\n\nWhat is known is that an explosion ripped through a building holding Ukrainian POWs killing more than 50 troops and wounding and maiming dozens more.\n\nRussian military bloggers and the AP posted videos and photographs inside the camp showing twisted metal bunks and charred bodies.\n\nIn a Friday press briefing, the Russian Defense Ministry accused Kyiv of using a US-made high-precision HIMARS missile to target the camp. One Russian military blogger posted photos of what he claimed were the remains of a US-made HIMARS missile. Russia said eight guards or camp administration personnel were injured in the explosion.\n\n\"A missile strike from the U.S.-made multiple launch rocket system (HIMARS) was carried out on a pre-trial detention center in the area of the settlement of Olenivka, where Ukrainian military prisoners of war, including fighters from the Azov battalion, are being held,\" the ministry said,\n\nInside the camp are POWs from the 2,500 survivors from the siege of Mariupol, with many coming from the Azov Regiment.\n\nUkraine Claims Russia Killed The POWs To Hide Atrocities:\n\nKyiv quickly denied Moscow's charges and made claims of their own, stating that Russia is responsible and killed the prisoners to hide the fact that POWs were being tortured.\n\n\"Russian occupiers are pursuing their criminal goals, accusing Ukraine of committing war crimes while hiding the torture and shooting of prisoners,\" the Ukrainian general staff said in a released statement.\n\n\"According to the commander of the Missile Forces and Artillery of the Land Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Armed Forces of Ukraine did not launch missile and artillery strikes in the area of Olenivka settlement,\" the statement said.\n\nRussian proxy separatists were in charge of the camp until the POWs from Mariupol were transferred there, then took over the running of the camp, which denotes the importance that Moscow thought of those particular troops. The new building that the prisoners were killed in was constructed just days before, and the prisoners moved there just prior to the blast.\n\nUkraine's domestic intelligence service, the SBU, posted an audio recording Friday night of what it claimed were two Russian-backed separatist fighters discussing the explosion over the phone. In the call, one person said there was no rocket sound before the explosion and that Russian forces had likely blown up the barracks themselves. Like the Russian claim, this audio recording can't be independently verified.\n\nWhile many say that Russia has little reason to kill a potential bargaining chip in the POWs, their attitude toward the Mariupol survivors, especially those of the Azov Regiment, is quite clear.\n\nThe Russian embassy in London has tweeted after the prison blast that Ukrainian prisoners of war from the Azov Regiment \"deserve execution, but death not by firing squad but by hanging, because they're not real soldiers. They deserve a humiliating death.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian General Staff has said that the UN and the ICRC should immediately investigate the attack on the compound.

According to the Russian occupation authorities, who had officially declared they'd prosecute some of the prisoners, the attack killed 53 prisoners, and injured 75.

It is a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war. More than 50 dead,\" reacted president Volodymyr Zelensky, on July 29, in his daily address.\n\nYet, both Moscow and Kiev are blaming each other for the massacre. A video first posted on the Telegram channel Rudenko shows a carnage extremely painful to watch: torn-off limbs, several dozen corpses lying both inside and outside a destroyed building, in what ressembles the courtyard of the penal colony. On one wall can be read the inscription, \"On the list: 193/in rank: 192.\" Most of the bodies are charred. A handful of faces are identifiable in the image. \"They were sleeping at the time of the shelling.

He termed the attack a \"deliberated war crime\" intended to kill the Ukrainian troops who reportedly surrendered during the Russian attack on Mariupol on the Azov Sea. \"I heard reports today about the attack of the occupiers on Olenivka, Donetsk region. It was a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war. More than 50 dead,\" Zelenskyy said in his signature format of addressing the nation.\n\nFurther, he appealed to Kyiv's closest ally, the United States, to declare Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism and added the Biden administration must take a concrete step to prevent the aggressor from committing further war crimes. \"There should be a clear legal recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. I am especially appealing to the United States of America - a solution is needed, needed now,\" said the Ukrainian head. \"Russia has proven with numerous terrorist attacks that it is the biggest source of terrorism in the world today. It's a fact,\" he added. Also, he urged the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to act judiciously to safeguard Ukrainian POWs.\n\nFurther, he maintained with the mediation of the United Nations and the ICRC, the process of evacuating the defenders of Mariupol who had surrendered following a month-long brutal attack, should begin at the earliest. According to Zelenskyy, Ukrainian diplomats brought the information about the Russian attack on Olenivka to the highest international level and added all participants in international relations knew what really happened. \"Russia won't be able to lie to anyone,\" he stressed.\n\nBefore wrapping up his address, he emphasised on his recent visit to Odesa Port where the Russians attacked within 24 hours after the finalisation of the grain deal this week. He stressed Odesa port is not only crucial for the war-torn nation for its economic growth but also possesses similar importance to addressing the global food crisis. Though he refrained from making any forecast, he asked its allies to watch how the agreements on grain export will be implemented while noting the UN, Turkey and other international partners are responsible for the security side of the process.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [], "image":

missile strike, with Moscow and Kyiv accusing each other on Friday of carrying out the attack. Russia's defence ministry said 40 prisoners were killed and 75 wounded in the attack on the prison, in the frontline town of Olenivka, in a part of Donetsk province held by separatists. A spokesman for the separatists put the death toll at 53 and accused Kyiv of targeting the prison with US-made Himars rockets. The ministry also said Himars rockets were to blame, Russian news agencies reported. Ukraine's armed forces denied carrying out the strike, saying Russian artillery had targeted the prison to hide the mistreatment of those held there. Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia had committed a war crime and called for international condemnation.\n\nReuters TV showed the remains of a cavernous burned-out building filled with metal beds, some with charred bodies lying on them while other bodies were lined up on military stretchers or on the ground outside. Shell fragments had been laid out on a blue metal bench. It was not immediately possible to detect any identifying markings and it was not clear where the fragments had been collected. The Russian defence ministry said that the prison housed Ukrainian POWs and that eight prison staff were also wounded. Russian-backed separatist leader Denis Pushilin was quoted as saying there were no foreigners among the 193 detainees.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence said Thursday's prison strike was a \"deliberate act of terrorism\". The domestic security agency said it had intercepted phone calls which point to Russia being responsible.

Ukraine said Russia carried out the attack to cover up evidence of other war crimes.\n\nMoscow published footage of what it said was the camp after the attack took place.\n\nThe unverified video shows a destroyed building with damaged bunk beds and badly burnt bodies.\n\nThe exact details of what happened at the camp, controlled by the Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk People's Republic, remain unclear.\n\nMr Zelenksy joined his foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in calling for the Red Cross and United Nations to intervene and investigate.\n\nThe prisoners detained at the facility - many of whom are believed to have been captured while defending the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol - should have been protected by guarantees secured by both organisations.\n\n\"It was a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war,\" Mr Zelensky said. \"Russia has proven with numerous terrorist attacks that it is the biggest source of terrorism in today's world.\"\n\nThe Red Cross said it had requested access to the prison so that it can help evacuate and treat the 130 POWs who Ukraine said were wounded by the attack.\n\nRussia put the number of wounded at 75 and the figure dead at 40.\n\nThe Red Cross said in a statement: \"Our priority right now is making sure that the wounded receive life-saving treatment and that the bodies of those who lost their lives are dealt with in a dignified manner.\n\n\"We have requested access to determine the health and condition of all the people present on-site at the time of the attack. We are also in contact with families, taking their requests and inquiries.\n\n\"All prisoners of war, wherever they are held, are protected under international humanitarian law. They are no longer part of the fight and should not be attacked.

While independent verification of when or where the videos were filmed has not been possible yet, Aric Toler, the director of research and training for the investigative collective Bellingcat, told the Washington Post that the \"Z\" symbol, used to show support for the Russian war effort, belies some claims that the video is older than the Ukrainian war.\n\nThis is hardly the first time Russian soldiers have been documented participating in abuse of Ukrainian soldiers, as well as civilians. From the early days of the war, Ukrainian authorities and international human rights organizations have catalogued a constant stream of violence. In April, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported 10 witness or victim accounts of executions, mock executions, sexual violence, and looting in Russian-occupied territories. One woman told HRW that while she was sheltering in Malaya Rohan, a village in the Kharkiv region, a Russian soldier sexually assaulted and beat her. Another witness recounted Russian soldiers making five men kneel down with their shirts pulled over their heads before they shot and killed one of them.\n\n\"Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces' custody should be investigated as war crimes,\" said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, in the release.\n\nThe bombing of the jail holding POWs, some of whom were involved with the defense of Mariupol's Azovstal Iron and Steel Works, has sparked an even more pitched conversation about the Russian treatment of Ukrainian prisoners and POWs. The attack, in a municipality called Olenivka, resulted in at least 53 prisoners deaths and 75 injuries, according to Russia's defense ministry.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has released a statement requesting access to those who are injured \"to determine the health and condition of all the people present on-site at the time of the attack.\"\n\nUnder the Geneva Conventions, Russia is obligated to give the ICRC free access to all POWs. While the ICRC has requested access to the prison where the Ukrainian POWs died in Olenivka and offered to help evacuate those wounded in the attack on the facility, as of Sunday it has not been given permission to do so.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskyy called for an investigation, deeming the bombing of the facility holding Ukrainian POWs a war crime.\n\n\"When the defenders of Azovstal left the plant, the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross acted as guarantors of the life and health of our soldiers. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Security Service, the Main Intelligence Directorate and the representative of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine issued a joint statement addressing to the UN and the Red Cross as guarantors of those agreements regarding the defenders of Azovstal. I support this statement. Now the guarantors must react. They must protect the lives of hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war,\" Zelenskyy said in a statement.\n\nThe European Union has already condemned Russia for its \"unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine and its people,\" noting the conflict \"brings further horrific atrocities day by day,\" but is now also voicing support for an investigation into the bombing specifically.\n\nBoth Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of being responsible for the bombing.\n\nRussia has also been implicated in other violations of international law, including forcibly removing and relocating people, including children, from occupied Ukrainian territories. Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova told Reuters in June that she is currently investigating multiple inquiries into the forcible transfer of people to Russia. \"From the first days of the war, we started this case about genocide,\" Venediktova told Reuters. She was unable to provide a number of exactly how many victims were transferred.\n\nThe United States State Department suspects between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainian citizens, including 260,000 children, have been detained and transferred to Russia, often to isolated regions.\n\n\"Moscow's actions appear pre-meditated and draw immediate historical comparisons to Russian 'filtration' operations in Chechnya and other areas. President Putin's 'filtration' operations are separating families,\u202fconfiscating Ukrainian passports, and issuing Russian passports in an apparent effort to change the demographic makeup of parts of Ukraine,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote in the statement. Reports also show Russia is deliberately separating children from their families and putting children up for adoption.\n\nWhile Russia is losing face with and becoming more isolated from the West, the country is digging in on other strategic partnerships.\n\nRussia's Middle Eastern and African allies have been feeling the pinch from Western countries who expect them to distance themselves from Putin's actions, creating an uncomfortable dance based on necessity from both sides. Access to Russia's grain exports and other food goods remains a key pressure point for African and Middle Eastern countries. In east Africa, extreme drought and the Ukraine conflict are pushing countries to the brink, according to a report from the United Nations.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov was recently in Cairo as part of his geostrategic Africa trip, addressing organizations on Russia's military operations in Ukraine. He said the West pushed Russia to invade after ignoring concerns over NATO's expansion.\n\nThe U.S. is making a geopolitical move itself by sending President Joe Biden's ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, to Ghana, as well as Secretary of State Blinken to multiple African nations in the coming weeks. U.S. Agency for International Development chief Samantha Power was also recently in Somalia and Kenya.\n\nInternational calls to prosecute Russia for its crimes continue to mount, with the European Union urging action to be taken in The Hague.\n\n\"The perpetrators of war crimes and other serious violations, as well as the responsible government officials and military representatives, will be held accountable,\" the Union said in a statement shortly after the Donetsk prison bombings. \"The European Union actively supports all measures to ensure accountability for human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law committed during the Russian aggression in Ukraine.\"\n\nWhile it's technically possible that Putin and other members of the Russian government could be tried, the chances of it happening are remote.\n\nThe International Criminal Court is known for prosecuting crimes against humanity, but is meant as a last resort if all other systems fail. Investigators from the ICC are already working to gather evidence in Ukraine, and while they recognize the court's jurisdiction, Russia does not, so the ICC can only prosecute crimes committed by Russia within Ukraine's borders.\n\nSince Russia is not one of the 123 countries who are members of the court, any violations of international law committed within their borders cannot be prosecuted. That means Ukrainians who were tortured or harmed in Russia cannot be helped by the court.\n\nPutin and his officials could simply evade the problem of possible prosecution by staying in power and not leaving Russian borders or those of their allies. Because the ICC cannot try defendants who are not present at The Hague for the trial itself, and it does not have a mechanism to enforce warrants, it's entirely reliant on member countries to arrest and bring defendants to The Hague.\n\nUkraine has already prosecuted Russian soldiers, with one pleading guilty to killing a civilian and receiving a sentence of 15 years after an appeal. This may be Ukraine's best course of action toward finding some sort of justice, however onerous, requiring the monumental task of tracking down Russian soldiers, arresting them, and putting them on trial.", "source": {"uri": "vox.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vox"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YomQFN4zxxXNtTarPUmDKwZUuj8=/0x500:6000x3500/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23913554/1242198989.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.6392156862745098, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 40, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 50, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7133407499", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-30", "time": "07:33:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-30T07:33:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-30T07:33:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "url": "https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/moscow-kyiv-trade-blame-over-pow-jail-bombing-that-killed-dozens-175739", "title": "Moscow, Kiev trade blame over POW jail bombing that killed dozens - World News", "body": "Moscow and Kiev on July 29 accused each other of bombing a jail holding Ukrainian prisoners of war in Russian-held territory, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky saying more than 50 were killed and calling the attack a war crime.\n\nRussia's defence ministry alleged that the strikes were carried out by Ukraine with US-supplied long-range missiles, in an \"egregious provocation\" designed to stop soldiers from surrendering.\n\nIt said that among the dead were Ukrainian forces that had laid down their arms after weeks of fighting off Russia's brutal bombardment of the sprawling Azovstal steel works in Mariupol.\n\nBut Zelensky laid the blame squarely on Russia.\n\n\"This was a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war,\" Zelensky said in his daily address to the nation late Friday. \"Over 50 are dead.\"\n\nZelensky said an agreement for the Azovstal fighters to lay down their arms, brokered by the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, included guarantees for their health and safety and called on those two organizations to intervene, as guarantors.\n\nZelensky also urged the international community, especially the United States, to have Russia officially declared as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\n\"A decision is needed, needed right now,\" he said.\n\nIn a sign of Washington's continued support of Kiev, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov for the first time since the beginning of the war Friday, urging Moscow against annexing any more Ukrainian territory occupied by Russian forces.\n\n\"It was very important that the Russians hear directly from us that that will not be accepted -- and not only will it not be accepted, it will result in additional significant costs being imposed upon Russia if it follows through,\" Blinken told reporters in Washington.\n\nEarlier in the day, Zelensky visited a port in southern Ukraine to oversee a ship being loaded with grain for export under a UN-backed plan aimed at getting millions of tonnes of Ukrainian grain stranded by Russia's naval blockade to world markets.\n\nUkraine's presidency released footage of Zelensky standing in front of Turkish ship Polarnet in the port of Chornomorsk on a visit to inspect grain being loaded. Ukraine's presidency said exports could start in the \"coming days.\"\n\nIn Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman agreed to work together to limit the

up its production.\n\nFollowing the strike on the prison, Russian state-television showed what appeared to be destroyed barracks and tangled metal beds, but no casualties could be seen.\n\nUkraine's military also denied carrying out the attack saying its forces \"did not launch missile and artillery strikes in the area of Olenivka settlement\" in the eastern region of Donetsk.\n\nIt instead blamed Russia's invading forces for \"a targeted artillery shelling\" on the detention facility, saying it was being used to \"accuse Ukraine of committing 'war crimes', as well as to hide the torture of prisoners and executions\".\n\nUkraine's forces in May ended a weeks-long defence of Azovstal, with around 2,500 combatants surrendering after calling a halt to their resistance.\n\nMoscow's state media has reported that some officers -- including those from the controversial Azov regiment -- have been taken to Russia.\n\nKiev meanwhile says it has captured thousands of Russian troops during the invasion and has begun putting some on trial for alleged war crimes.\n\nA Ukrainian court on Friday reduced the life sentence handed to a Russian soldier in May for pre-meditated murder in the country's first war crimes trial, instead jailing the serviceman for 15 years.\n\nRussian strikes elsewhere in Ukraine killed five people and wounded seven more on Friday in the heavily bombed city of

At least 53 captured Ukrainian fighters have been killed in an explosion in a prison in Olenivka, Donetsk region, a territory occupied by Russia. An explosion occurred at a prison facility, which housed Ukrainian prisoners of war, including some from the Azovstal plant, leading to 53 POWs being killed and at least 75 injured, multiple sources report. The Ukrainian Security Service has claimed that the attack was conducted by the Wagner paramilitary organization without prior coordination with the Russian military, with the possible goal being to increase pressure on the Ukrainian side to renew negotiations, another possible goal being destroying proof of prisoner torture. Russian sources claim that the attack was deliberately conducted by the Ukrainian army using the HIMARS MLRS, in an attempt to prevent the prisoners from cooperating with the Russian authorities. Ukraine has called for delegations from the U.N. and the Red Cross to be allowed to conduct an independent investigation on-site and evacuate the injured.\n\nMykolaiv.

Lavrov did not specify what he meant, and the call was primarily focused on the topic of prisoner swaps, with the U.S. looking to bring Brittney Griner, a high-profile basketball player who was detained in Russia on charges of marijuana possession, back home.\n\nThe current frontrunner to be the next Prime Minister of the U.K. and current Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, said she would be Ukraine's \"greatest friend\" if she won office and said she would call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy straight away.

Click on the conversation bubble to join the conversation Got it!\n\nIn 2014, the town of Olenivka in Eastern Ukraine fell under control of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), a separatist group now controlled by Moscow. That August, the Volnovakha Correctional Colony No. 120 in the town of roughly 4,500 persons became a prison camp for Ukrainians soldiers and political prisoners captured by DPR militants and the Russian military.\n\nEight years later in July 2022, a group of between 193 and 211 Ukrainian soldiers were regrouped into a new barracks in the Volnovakha complex. All were members of the far-right Azov unit which had surrendered on May 16 under a guarantee of protection from the United Nations and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) after resisting beseiging Russian forces for three months in the city of Mariupol.\n\nJust few days later in the evening of July 28, a blast consumed their new dormitory in flames, killing at least 53 of the interred POWs and injuring at least 75 and up to 130 more. Gruesome video footage released by Russia and other news agencies show numerous scorched bodies, some reduced to carbonized ashes while sleeping in their beds.\n\nNo other buildings were damaged (as can be seen in satellite photos) and no guards were killed.\n\nThe ICRC subsequently requested access to the surviving Ukrainian POWs, the safety of which it had guaranteed, but were refused it.\n\nMoscow claimed the Olenivka prison had been struck by a missile fired by a HIMARS rocket artillery system given to Ukraine by the U.S. The HIMARS's GPS-guided M31 rockets have proven effective in destroying Russian ammo depots and surface-to-air missile batteries, as well as holing bridges Russian logistics depend upon.\n\nRussian troops displayed fragments allegedly from the HIMARS strike, though without evidence that they were recovered at the site of the attack.\n\nRussian sources claimed Ukraine attacked to prevent the POWs from 'exposing' their supposed crimes, or to discourage Ukrainian troops from surrendering.\n\nUkraine denied it had carried out a strike and Ukrainian intelligence specifically claimed that the Russian private mercenary company Wagner Group set out on its own initiative to cover up the torture of Azov prisoners by killing them in such a manner to discredit the Ukrainian military and deflate Ukrainian morale after the successes of its HIMARS artillery.\n\nIn effect, besides the supporters of Russia's war in Ukraine, most observers find it far more likely that forces allied with Moscow carried out the deadly attack. Here's why.\n\nThe prison's use to house Ukrainian POWs was known since 2014.\n\nUnlike conventional rocket artillery which often scatters unguided projectiles hundreds of meters from the designated target, the M31 rockets used by Ukrainian HIMARS systems are designed to land within a few meters of a pre-specified GPS coordinate -- a capability affirmed by holes that have precisely been punched through targeted bridges.\n\nSo the attack couldn't be a case of a random shot landing far off target. An M31 was only likely to strike the dormitory in Olenivka if Ukrainian planners deliberately intended it to.\n\nTo be sure, it's not unheard of in war for POWs to inadvertently fall victim to friendly bombardments. But Ukrainian personnel would have been well aware of the prison's location and function. The DPR also prior released propaganda videos highlighting the internment of Azov fighters in the facility.\n\nUkraine's military would have had to deliberately seek to kill its own prisoners in the one specific building the Azov prisoners had been moved into.\n\nUkraine probably wouldn't have used a HIMARS to hit a target in Olenivka.\n\nOlenivka is about 9 miles away from the frontline -- a short enough distance that regular Ukrainian shorter-range artillery could attack it without expending expensive HIMARS missiles capable of hitting targets over 43 miles away.\n\nExpatriating the Azov POWs would have been a big political win for Kyiv.\n\nThere has been immense political pressure on Kyiv to somehow secure the release of forces captured by Russia in Mariupol, who came to be seen as icons of Ukrainian resistance for their three-month stand in Mariupol while starving and under constant bombardment.\n\nThe notion Russia's supporters propose that there was some cynical political incentive for Ukraine to kill its own POWs is absurd when the return of these prisoners alive would have been an important boost to morale and a big political win for Ukrainian leaders.\n\nEven pro-Russian militants appear to believe the POWs were deliberately killed by Russian forces.\n\nA purportedly intercepted phone call released by Ukraine's intelligence service appears to show that a DPR fighter stationed near Olenivka doesn't believe the official line that Ukraine attacked the facility.\n\nThe caller claim that Russian Grad rocket artillery trucks were positioned \"100 meters from the fence\" of the prison facility and launched several volleys towards Ukrainian positions.\n\nHe insists, however, that during the rocket barrage, three explosions detonated inside the dormitory even though no sound or other evidence of incoming fire was discernible. He believes instead that explosives planted inside the prison by Russian personnel were remotely detonated, using the racket of the rocket salvo and the possibility of counter-battery fire as a cover.\n\nThe damage to the facility doesn't resemble a HIMARS attack.\n\nPhotos from inside the Olenivka complex show rows of scorched bunk beds that, though warped by heat, have mostly remained upright. And the building's exterior remains essentially intact.\n\nThomas Theiner, a former solder in the Italian Army with expertise on artillery, notes in a Twitter thread that the dormitory doesn't exhibit the kind of extensive kinetic impact damage typical of a building hit by an M31 rocket, which would likely have left a notable crater and knocked everything down around it.\n\nTheiner points out that Russia, however, makes relatively extensive use of incendiary and/or fuel-air explosive type weapons like the portable RPO-A and RPO-Z \"Shmel\" 'flame-thrower' rockets that do cause combustion and are designed to efficiently kill people in buildings.\n\nHowever, both Ukraine's intelligence service and the DPR fighters in the intercepted phone call above suggest another method -- explosives planted inside the building prior to the explosion.\n\nQuestionable messaging from Russian embassy\n\nThe day after the attack, Russia's UK embassy shared a quote from alleged pro-Russian civilians in Mariupol advocating for the \"humiliating death\" of the Azov prisoners of war, in contravention of the Geneva convention:\n\nThe post has come under scrutiny for violating Twitter's rules against advocating violence, but Twitter explained it would keep the post up out of public interest.\n\nWho has a track record of deception?\n\nStrictly speaking, one side can easily dismiss evidence produced by the other as doctored. Furthermore, one should generally treat the claims of warring parties with skepticism, especially claims of enemy losses.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean all claims are equally plausible, nor that all parties should be treated as equally credible.\n\nRussia's narrative claims Ukrainian officials diabolically used an expensive guided long-range missile to kill their own celebrated war heroes in service of some hypothetical coverup, despite Kyiv having orchestrated several prisoner swaps for other well-known prisoners and having pressed hard to secure the exchange of Azov fighters.\n\nAlternatively, one could believe that Moscow is deliberately lying about the actions of its own forces.\n\nThe massacre at Olenivka coincides horribly with the release of an atrocious video on Telegram depicting a Russian soldier mutilating the genitals of a Ukrainian POW while two other soldiers watch. In a separate video, the soldier is then killed with a shot to the head. A Russian military vehicle with the pro-Ukraine invasion 'Z' emblem can be seen in the background.\n\nIt should go without saying that prisoners of war are entitled to humane treatment regardless of which side they are on as defined in the Geneva Convention. (Yes, that includes Russian POWs, several of whom were apparently maimed or killed in Ukrainian captivity based on videos in March and April). If POWs are allegedly culpable of war crimes, than they are entitled a fair, non-kangaroo court trial with due process to ascertain guilt or innocence.\n\nIncidents such as that at Olenivka should receive the scrutiny of an independent investigation to determine exactly who was responsible for the killing of more than fifty sleeping men.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sebastien_roblin@forbes.com", "name": "Sebastien Roblin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/62e721ac4f22f3c0379932e2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2454,1381,x413,y395,safe&width=1200", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 24, "stanza_neu": 34, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 58, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7136130385", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-01", "time": "21:10:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-01T21:10:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-01T21:00:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "url": "https://hotair.com/john-s-2/2022/08/01/us-officials-russia-is-lying-about-what-killed-ukrainian-pows-n486709", "title": "US Officials: Russia is lying about what killed Ukrainian POWs", "body": "Last Friday I wrote about the dueling claims of responsibility over an explosion at a prison where Ukrainian POWs were being held. Russia claimed the explosion, which killed at least 53 POWs, was the result of a Ukrainian strike with a US-made HIMARS missile. But Ukraine denied firing any artillery in the vicinity and blamed Russia for the explosion. Ukraine later released what they claimed was an intercept between two Russian soldiers which implied there was no missile strike at all at the prison. Instead one of the voices claimed it had been blown up intentionally by the Russians after herding POWs into a specific barracks inside the prison.\n\nIn keeping with that, an adviser to President Zelensky argued yesterday on Twitter that this was not a strike at all but a bomb detonated from the inside the building.\n\nToday, Politico reports US officials have made their own assessment of the prison and concluded the damage was not caused by a HIMARS strike.\n\n\"We know Ukraine didn't attack the site with HIMARS because the site doesn't have the indications it would have if it was hit with HIMARS,\" one of the officials said.\n\nWhile one of the officials stopped short of saying Ukraine was not responsible for the strike, the other official said the evidence showed the attack was not conducted by Kyiv. Satellite photos of the site released by Maxar Technologies on July 30 appear to show damage only to the section of the detention center housing Ukrainian prisoners, with no collateral damage to surrounding buildings.\n\nOver the weekend, Ukrainian authorities called for an international investigation into the attack. They rejected Moscow's claims, saying they are gathering evidence that will prove Russia was responsible for the deaths of the prisoners in what they described as a \"terrorist attack.\"...\n\n\"It was a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war,\" Zelenskyy said in a speech on Friday.\n\nI'm not generally a fan of Max Boot these days but his opinion piece about the dueling claims is pretty spot on. The Russian claims about what happened here make zero sense.\n\nIt is, of course, possible that an errant Ukrainian artillery strike might have hit the prisoner-of-war camp near Olenivka, in eastern Ukraine. But the Ukrainians deny that they fired any artillery in the area on Friday, and the Russians aren't claiming a \"friendly fire\" accident. Russian media claims that the Ukrainians deliberately slaughtered their own soldiers to discourage others from surrendering and to prevent these soldiers, who belonged to the Azov Regiment, from testifying about supposed Ukrainian war crimes.\n\nAs usual, Russian propaganda makes no sense. The Azov Regiment surrendered in Mariupol only after receiving orders to do so from Kyiv, and the only war crimes its members witnessed were committed by the Russians against the people of Mariupol. They are heroes in Ukraine, and governments -- even governments far less democratic and law-abiding than the one in Kyiv -- do not ordinarily kill their own heroes.\n\nThe Russians, by contrast, have plenty of reason to murder these soldiers, whose desperate resistance in the Azovstal steel plant cost the Russians dearly and prevented them from shifting forces to the east. The Russian Embassy in London actually tweeted on Friday: \"Azov militants deserve execution ... because they're not real soldiers. They deserve a humiliating death.\"\n\nHe concludes by saying, \"unless it is proven otherwise, we should assume that every word out of the mouths of Kremlin spokespeople is a lie -- including 'and' and 'the.'\" For once I agree with him completely.\n\nFinally, adding to the suspicioun that the Russian claims don't add up is the fact that the Red Cross requested access to the scene to deal with the injured and the bodies of those killed in the blast. So far they haven't gotten a response.\n\n\"Our priority right now is making sure that the wounded receive lifesaving treatment and that the bodies of those who lost their lives are dealt with in a dignified manner,\" the Red Cross said.\n\nBut the organization said late Saturday that its request to access the prison had not been granted yet.\n\n\"Granting ICRC access to POWs is an obligation of parties to conflict under the Geneva Conventions,\" the ICRC said on Twitter.\n\nIt seems the Russians aren't eager for anyone to get a close up view of the site or to talk to any survivors, if there are any.

The Ukrainian authorities rejected the narrative as absurd and said that the deaths were a premeditated atrocity committed by Russian forces from within the prison, where survivors described being given just enough food to survive and suffering ritual beatings, including with chains and metal pipes.\n\nThe explosion is particularly painful for the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine because many of the dead had fought to defend Mariupol, a port on the Black Sea, and then retreated to the city's Azovstal steelworks. For weeks there, they withstood a Russian onslaught before finally surrendering in May.\n\nFor many Ukrainians, the Azovstal siege became a symbol of the country's suffering and defiance, and the soldiers who fought there, an estimated 2,500 of whom were taken as prisoners of war, have been viewed as heroes.\n\n\"It was a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war,\" Mr. Zelensky said in an address late on Friday.\n\nMr. Zelensky said that the Red Cross, along with the United Nations, had acted \"as guarantors of the life and health of our soldiers,\" and that now they must take action. \"They must protect the lives of hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war,\" he said.\n\nA series of Russian missile strikes on civilian targets, including shopping malls and apartment buildings, has led Ukraine's government to call on Washington to designate Moscow as a state sponsor of terrorism, something Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken has resisted.\n\nJosep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union's top foreign policy official, said in a statement that every day Russia's continued \"illegitimate and unjustified war of aggression\" brought \"further horrific atrocities,\" adding that the \"inhumane, barbaric acts\" breached the Geneva Conventions and amounted to war crimes.\n\nOur Coverage of the Russia-Ukraine WarGrain Blockade: A breakthrough deal aims to lift a Russian blockade on Ukrainian grain shipments, easing a global food crisis. But in the fields of Ukraine, farmers are skeptical.An Ambitious Counterattack: Ukraine has been laying the groundwork to retake Kherson from Russia. But the endeavor would require huge resources, and could come at a heavy toll.Economic Havoc: As food, energy and commodity prices continue to climb around the world, few countries are feeling the bite as much as Ukraine.Inside a Siege: For 80 days, at the Avtostal steelworks, a relentless Russian assault met unyielding Ukrainian resistance. This is how it was for those who were there.\n\nKaja Kallas, the prime minister of Estonia, a Baltic country that has been among Moscow's toughest antagonists over the war, said Russia was responsible for the \"mass murder\" of prisoners at the camp, an act that she said called to mind \"the darkest chapters of history.\"\n\n\"There must be no impunity for war crimes, just like there can be no return to relations with war criminals,\" she said in a statement.\n\nFor Mr. Zelensky, the prison explosion fits a pattern in which an unwarranted invasion of his country, ordered by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, has been accompanied by atrocities committed by Russian forces, for example in suburbs north of the capital, Kyiv, and missile strikes on civilian targets, including one this month at a shopping mall in the center of the country far from the front lines.\n\nRussia controls around 20 percent of Ukraine's territory, but after it deployed its superior artillery power to seize much of Luhansk Province in the eastern Donbas region earlier this month, Kyiv is now pressing a counteroffensive in Kherson Province in an attempt to reclaim land.\n\nMoscow denies that it has committed atrocities or targeted civilians, and on Saturday the defense ministry said that Ukrainians had killed their own soldiers using precision-guided, American-made missiles, known as HIMARS, to strike the prison camp in Russian-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAn adviser to Ukraine's president, Mykhailo Podoliak, told The New York Times that an expert analysis of photos and videos released by Russia indicated that the center of the explosion was inside the building, with the building's exterior practically undamaged.\n\nLive Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated July 30, 2022, 10:13 a.m. ETPrisoners describe harsh treatment in the Russian camp where an explosion killed dozens.Fear and fury: Families of Ukrainian prisoners of war worry for the fate of loved ones.Ukrainian officials compile evidence that they say shows Russia was behind prison camp blast.\n\nIn addition, he said that the speed of Russian propaganda after the attack suggested planning. Prisoners had been moved to the barracks where the explosion occurred only days before and it was suspicious that no Russian soldiers or workers at the prison were injured, he said. Beyond that, he said that, before the explosion, Russia had moved debris to the camp from previous strikes elsewhere that had involved HIMARS weapons.\n\nTetiana Kravchenko, a Ukrainian rights activist whose organization has been in contact with prisoners in the camp, said that a prisoner had called his wife on Thursday night and reported hearing an explosion, rather than shelling, around 11 p.m. She said she had a recording of the call, in which the prisoner said that two of his friends had been moved to a different building within the prison on the day of the explosion and that one was now dead and the other wounded.\n\nSoldiers held in other parts of the camp have also relayed similar accounts to their own family members, she said.\n\nThe competing claims could not be immediately independently verified. Ms. Kravchenko said she could not disclose more information without risking the safety of prisoners still being held at the camp.\n\nAt its heart, the invasion has killed tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians and brought misery to many more. It has also had far-reaching external consequences, reviving NATO, isolating Russia, raising energy prices and depressing global growth. Given Ukraine's importance to global grain markets and Russia's effective blockade of the country's Black Sea ports, it has also threatened some countries in the Middle East and Africa with food shortages and hunger.\n\nThe first shipments of grain since the beginning of the conflict have been loaded onto freighters at Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea. The shipments would be the fruit of a deal brokered by Turkey and the United Nations around a week ago. Mr. Zelensky and representatives of the Group of 7 industrialized nations visited Chernomorsk, one of the three ports in Odesa Province, on Friday.\n\nOdesa has been a frequent target of Russian missile strikes, the most recent being a week ago with an attack on the port that cast doubt on the grain deal. Indeed, Mr. Podoliak said the prison explosion was another sign that Russian assurances that it would allow safe passage for grain ships across the Black Sea could not be trusted.\n\nElsewhere on the ground, the battle has largely devolved into a series of incremental offensive and defensive maneuverers that have seen only limited territory changing hands each week.\n\nThe Donbas region, where Ukraine's military said on Saturday that it repelled the latest Russian attempts to advance, is the clearest example of this slowdown. But in Kherson Province, Ukraine hopes that the HIMARS weapons and others supplied by the West will help it advance.\n\nUkraine said it pounded critical Russian logistical hubs overnight into Saturday and was making small but steady gains as it moved toward the city of Kherson, a shipbuilding center and port, where Ukrainian missile strikes on a bridge across the Dnipro River have left Russian defenders largely isolated.\n\nIt will be weeks and perhaps longer before the outcome of the Kherson counteroffensive will be decided, not least because the war testifies to the military maxim that attack is more difficult than defense. But a senior U.S. Defense Department official told a news briefing on Friday that there was growing evidence that steep Russian losses had left some units ill-prepared to fight. The official described Russia's recent efforts as a failure both on the battlefield and at home.\n\nMichael Schwirtz contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/30/world/30UKRAINE-LEDEALL-TOP/30UKRAINE-LEDEALL-TOP-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.6549019607843137, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 18, "stanza_neu": 35, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 53, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7133099469", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "22:10:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T22:10:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T21:44:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5686274766921997, "url": "https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/video/dozens-ukrainian-pows-killed-missile-214442857.html", "title": "Dozens of Ukrainian POWs killed in missile strike", "body": "STORY: Dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war appear to have been killed in a missile strike that destroyed a prison building on the frontline of the conflict.\n\nThis report contains graphic content of the incident.\n\nThe Russian and Ukrainian governments are accusing each other of carrying out the attack, which happened in the town of Olenivka.

Track the invasion with our maps.\n\nA disputed blast kills Ukrainian P.O.W.s\n\nRussia and Ukraine traded blame for an explosion at a prison camp in the Russia-occupied eastern Donetsk region that killed at least 40 Ukrainian prisoners of war.\n\nThe attack took place yesterday in the town of Olenivka, where Russia is holding thousands of Ukrainian prisoners of war, including about 2,500 fighters who were forced to surrender at the Azovstal plant in Mariupol. The fighters are considered war heroes in Ukraine, while Russia has treated the prisoners as trophies.\n\nEach side accused the other of committing a war crime. At least 40 captured fighters were killed and dozens more were maimed, according to both Ukrainian and Russian officials.\n\nRussia's defense minister claimed that Ukraine had used a U.S.-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, to strike the prison. Ukraine's motive, Russia said, was to intimidate Ukrainian soldiers who might consider surrendering.\n\nUkraine rejected the claim, accusing Russia of bombing the facility to hide evidence of torture and extrajudicial executions and calling it a false-flag operation to discredit Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's domestic intelligence service, the S.B.U., published an audio recording of what it claimed were two Russian-backed separatist fighters discussing the explosion over the phone. In the call, which could not be independently verified, one person said that there was no sound of any rocket before the explosion, and that Russian forces had likely blown up the barracks themselves.\n\nPrisoners who have been released from Olenivka described hellish conditions at the camp. They said guards provided just enough food for prisoners to survive and meted out regular beatings.\n\nThe Ukrainian General Staff said in a statement that it used the HIMARS exclusively to attack Russian military targets. The HIMARS units have fired hundreds of satellite-guided rockets in Ukraine, and there have been no reports of them mistakenly hitting civilian targets.\n\nThe explosion came one day after a video circulated online that appeared to show a Russian soldier castrating a Ukrainian prisoner of war. The video's authenticity could not be independently confirmed, and the location of the alleged mutilation was unclear.\n\nJOIN US ON TELEGRAM\n\nFollow our coverage of the war on the @nytimes channel.\n\nLabeling Russia a terrorist state\n\nPressure is mounting on Secretary of State Antony Blinken to formally declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism, a label currently reserved for North Korea, Syria, Cuba and Iran.\n\nThe Senate this week unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution supporting such a move after appeals from Ukraine, and the House of Representatives is gearing up for a similar vote. Blinken, however, is resisting the move, my colleagues Michael Crowley and Edward Wong report.\n\nIf the State Department were to add Russia to the list of state sponsors of terror, that finding would result in more sanctions on Russia's economy, including penalties on countries that do business with Moscow. It would also waive traditional legal barriers that prevent private citizens from suing foreign governments for damages, potentially including the families of Americans killed or injured while fighting Russia in Ukraine.\n\nSome supporters of the designation would not mind further isolating Russia.\n\nSenator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said the move would put Russia \"in a very small club.\"\n\n\"It consists of nations like Syria, Iran, Cuba, that are outside the bounds of civilized countries,\" he said. \"They are pariahs.\"\n\nIt could rupture, once and for all, the Biden administration's limited diplomatic links with Moscow, analysts say, at a time when the U.S. is trying to secure the release of two imprisoned Americans, Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan.\n\nEven during the war, the U.S. wants to continue working with Russia on some issues, including the international talks with Iran over restoring the 2015 nuclear agreement.\n\nWhat else we're following\n\nIn Ukraine\n\nA rocket hit a crowded bus stop in the southern city of Mykolaiv, killing at least five people, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nFrom Opinion: Writing in a guest essay, Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called on Western allies to increase their support and to reject what he described as Russia's \"fake peace proposals.\"\n\nIn Russia\n\nRussian authorities have asked a court to revoke the media license of Novaya Gazeta, the Moscow newspaper and website whose editor received a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nRussia's security service, the F.S.B., has become a far more expansive arm of an increasingly ruthless state, Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan write in Foreign Affairs.\n\nAround the world\n\nAuthorities in Lebanon were investigating whether a Syrian ship that docked in one of its ports was carrying Ukrainian grain stolen by Russia.\n\nA major U.N. nuclear conference begins next week.

Shelling continued overnight in the Donestsk, Dnipro and Kharkiv regions. Heavy shelling in Mykolaiv in Ukraine's south killed at least one person, governor Vitaliy Kim said. In the Donbas ground campaign, Russian forces are likely prioritizing offensive operations toward Bakhmut and around Donetsk City, at the expense of efforts to take Siversk and Slovyansk, the Institute for the Study of War said. Ukrainian forces disrupted a Russian ground assault in Kherson Oblast with preemptive artillery strikes.\n\n(All times CET)\n\nCrimean Official Says Five Wounded in Drone Attack (8:45 a.m.)\n\nFive people were wounded in a drone attack on the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea fleet in the Sevastopol in Russian-annexed Crimea.

At least 200,000 to 220,000 civilians live in areas of the Donetsk region under Kyiv's control, she said.\n\nAccess to Olenivka Not Granted, Ukraine's Red Cross Says (5:30 p.m.)\n\nAccess to the Olenivka penal facility in occupied Donetsk hasn't been granted, the Ukrainian branch of the Red Cross said, adding that it stands ready to \"support the return and transfer of mortal remains\" of some 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war killed there in an attack on Thursday night.\n\n\"Granting ICRC access to POWs is an obligation of parties to conflict under the Geneva Conventions,\" ICRC Ukraine said in a Twitter thread.\n\nUkraine Demands Details of POWs Killed in Attack (3:51 p.m.)\n\nUkraine's Coordination Centre on Handling Prisoner of War Issues demanded that Moscow provide a list of POWs killed and wounded in Thursday night's explosion in Olenivka, Donetsk. The center also seeks to retrieve the bodies of those killed, and has urged the Red Cross and the United Nations to immediately start an investigation.\n\nRussia hasn't responded to the request. Moscow has said the deadly attack on the correctional facility was conducted by Kyiv with US-supplied weapons. Russia's defense ministry earlier published a list of what it said were POWs from Ukraine's Azov battalion killed in Olenivka.\n\nFrance's foreign ministry joined the US and the EU in condemning the attack, which killed an estimated 50 POWs, as well as recent reports of the torture of Ukrainian prisoners. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it has requested access to the prison.\n\nGazprom Halts Gas Supplies to Latvia (10:24 a.m.)\n\nThe Russian gas producer Gazprom PJSC halted supplies to Latvia, saying the Baltic nation had \"violated the conditions\" of its purchases.

We will continue to pursue accountability and give Ukraine what it needs to defend itself against Moscow's horrific aggression.\"\n\nExplosions rang out on the night of July 29 in the colony in the captured city of Olenivka, Donetsk area, where Russians held Ukrainian POWs. Around 50 Ukrainian POWs were slain by a rocket attack, which Russia and Ukraine have laid the blame for on each other. Russia allegedly targeted the prison in an effort to obliterate evidence of homicide and torture, according to Ukraine. Whereas, Russia claims that Ukrainian precision rockets had struck the Olenivka prison camp.\n\nAccording to earlier statements by Russia's ministry of defence, the prisoners include soldiers of the Azov battalion who were trapped in the Azovstal steel complex in Mariupol. The prison lies in the town of Olenivka, which is about 10 kilometres from Ukraine's battle lines. Russia has issued lists of 75 wounded and 50 dead, but neither Ukraine's officials nor the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) have confirmed it.\n\nOn the other hand, western allies of Ukraine seem to be on its side. Josep Borrell, the high representative of the European Union, attributed the attack to Russia in a statement on July 29. Further, the International Committee of the Red Cross requested entry to the jail site and permission to remove the injured on the same day.\n\nRussia, however, requested specialists from the UN and Red Cross to investigate the killings on July 30.

defence ministry said the Ukrainian strikes were carried out with US-supplied long-range missiles, in an egregious provocation designed to stop soldiers surrendering.\n\nThe claims came as President Volodymyr Zelensky visited a port in southern Ukraine to oversee a ship being loaded with grain for export under a UN-backed plan aimed at ending a food crisis.\n\nUkraine's presidency said exports could start in the coming days under the plan aimed at getting millions of tonnes of Ukrainian grain stranded by Russia's naval blockade to world markets.\n\nFollowing the strike on the prison, Russian state-television showed what appeared to be destroyed barracks and tangled metal beds but no casualties could be seen.\n\nUkraine's military denied carrying out the attack saying its forces did not launch missile and artillery strikes in the area of Olenivka settlement.\n\nIt instead blamed Russia's invading forces for a targeted artillery shelling on the detention facility, saying it was being used to accuse Ukraine of committing 'war crimes', as well as to hide the torture of prisoners and executions.\n\nUkraine's forces in May ended a weeks-long siege of Azovstal, with around 2,500 combatants surrendering after calling a halt to their first resistance.\n\nMoscow's state media has reported that some officers -- including those from the controversial Azov regiment -- have been taken into Russia.\n\nKyiv says it has captured thousands of Russian troops during the invasion and has begun putting some on trial for alleged war crimes.\n\nA Ukrainian court on Friday reduced the life sentence handed to a Russian soldier in May for pre-meditated murder in the country's first war crimes trial, instead jailing the serviceman for 15 years.\n\nRussian strikes elsewhere in Ukraine killed five people and wounded seven more on Friday on the heavily bombed city of Mykolaiv near the country's southern frontline, the regional governor said.\n\nThey shot at another area near a public transport stop, governor Vitaliy Kim said in a statement on social media.\n\nMykolaiv, near the Black Sea, has seen roughly half of its estimated pre-war population of nearly 500,000 people leave and the city has been shelled daily for weeks.\n\nIt is the largest Ukrainian-controlled urban hub near the frontlines in the Kherson region, where Kyiv's army has launched a counter-offensive to regain control of the economically and strategically important coastal territory.\n\nThe Ukrainian presidency said Friday that Russian strikes on the city a day earlier had struck a humanitarian aid distribution point and injured three people.\n\nIn the eastern Donetsk region, governor Pavlo Kyrylenko also said Friday that Moscow's forces had killed eight people and wounded 19 more in attacks over the previous day.\n\nThe ceaseless violence on the ground comes as Ukraine looks to push ahead with restarting crucial grain exports under a plan brokered by Turkey and the United Nations to lift Russia's Black Sea naval blockade.\n\nUkraine's presidency released footage of Zelensky standing in front of Turkish ship Polarnet in the port of Chornomorsk on a visit to inspect grain being loaded.\n\nThe first vessel, the first ship is being loaded since the beginning of the war, Zelensky said in a statement.\n\nZelensky said Kyiv was waiting for a signal from Ankara and UN to start exports that it is hoped will help mitigate a global food crisis that has seen prices soar.\n\nThe hike in food costs is just one of the shock waves that Moscow's war in Ukraine has sent reverberating around the world.\n\nEnergy prices have also risen dramatically as Moscow has cut gas supplies to Europe and the turbulence has wracked the oil markets.\n\nThe French presidency said that leader Emmanuel Macron and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had agreed to work together to limit the impact of the war at talks in Paris.\n\nMacron took the meeting despite fierce criticism from rights

There were also Russian advances in the neighboring town of Soledar, but they were repulsed. The information could not be independently verified at first.\n\nThe Ukrainian General Staff also reported fighting northwest and west of the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. However, the Russian attacks on Pisky and Marjinko were unsuccessful, it said.\n\nAccording to the governor of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, three civilians have been killed in Russian attacks in the past 24 hours. Two are dead in the town of Bakhmut, one in nearby Soledar, explains Governor Pavlo Kirilenko.\n\nThe city of Kharkiv was also attacked by the Russian army, said Oleh Synegubow, the governor of the Kharkiv region. Two civilians were wounded.\n\nAccording to the Russian military, it has once again destroyed Western military technology in Kharkiv. Two launch sites for US HIMARS missiles were hit on the grounds of the factory, Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said on Monday. Not far from the Black Sea metropolis of Odessa, Russian troops destroyed a Harpoon anti-ship missile device, which was also supplied by the United States.\n\nThe statements could not be independently verified. Experts point out that HIMARS rocket launchers are difficult to locate and destroy. Ukrainian authorities reported on Sunday that two Russian missiles were fired from the annexed peninsula of Crimea at the Odesa area. However, according to her testimony, the missiles hit the quarry.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine received four more HIMARS missile systems from the US, its defense minister said. Minister Oleksiy Reznikov wrote on Twitter that he is grateful to President Joe Biden, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and the American people for supporting the Ukrainian army. HIMARS multi-barrel rocket launchers have a longer range and are more accurate than Soviet-era Ukrainian artillery.\n\nWestern military aid, with which Ukraine says it launches counter-offensives that have been successful in some cases, is a thorn in Russia's side. Moscow also repeatedly uses the alleged destruction of these weapons to justify attacks on a neighboring country.\n\nMore than a week ago, the Russian military shelled the port of Odessa - according to its own statements, to destroy Harpoon missiles. Internationally, the attack caused particular outrage because only recently was an agreement reached on the export of previously blocked Ukrainian grain - including from the port of Odessa. For the first time since the start of Russia's war of aggression more than five months ago, a ship loaded with grain left port on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Union announced that it has given Ukraine 1 billion euros in aid to support the country's budget and help it deal with the financial consequences of the war. This billion is part of a large aid package totaling nine billion euros, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said on the Telegram short message service. \"The funds will help finance the priority needs of households.\" The first tranche of EUR 500 million has already arrived at the Ukrainian Central Bank, and the second is expected to follow on August 2.\n\nBritain, meanwhile, sees signs of redeployment of Russian troops from eastern to southern Ukraine. Russia has apparently identified the front in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhia region as a weak point where reinforcements are needed, the Defense Ministry said in London on Monday, citing intelligence. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously reported in his video address on Monday evening that Russian troops were being moved to the south.\n\nShortly after the start of the war, Russia occupied large areas in southern Ukraine. However, Ukrainian troops have recently launched a counter-offensive there and put pressure on the Russian armed forces, also thanks to artillery supplied by the West.\n\n\"Russia is likely to adjust the operational design of its Donbas offensive after failing to make a decisive operational breakthrough according to the plan it has been implementing since April,\" it said. Russia is likely to redeploy a significant number of its armed forces from the northern Donbass sector to southern Ukraine.\n\nIn the east, the Russian offensive continues to falter, the ministry announced. \"Over the past four days, Russia has attempted further tactical attacks on the Bakhmut axis northeast of Donetsk and has made slow progress,\" the statement said.\n\nSince the beginning of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine at the end of February, the British Secret Service has been publishing information about the progress of the war in an unprecedented form every day.

Russian forces targeted several private houses in their shelling on the city of Mykolaiv. An exact number of casualties is yet to be announced, however it is confirmed that Oleksiy Vadatursky, a Ukrainian grain tycoon and one of the richest businessmen in Ukraine -- worth $430 million, according to Forbes Ukraine's estimates in 2021 -- was killed along with his wife, according to Mykolaiv mayor Oleskandr Senkyevych. Ukrainian officials allege that Vadatursky's house was deliberately targeted by Russian forces as the businessman has been an outspoken proponent of pro-Ukrainian policies.\n\nKharkiv. A Russian attack reported to consist of three S-300 missiles struck a technical college in Kharkiv, destroying one of the facility's buildings and starting a fire.\n\nIn Kharkiv, Russia's shelling also destroyed a publishing house and its printing facility in the city, where an estimated 80% of Ukrainian books are published.\n\nRussia cancelled all festivities for its annual Navy Day in Sevastopol, in the Russia-occupied Crimean peninsula, after an alleged drone attack by Ukraine on Russia's Crimea Naval headquarters. Five casualties have been reported by Russian media sources. Ukrainian officials deny launching the attack and call the allegation a 'provocation.'\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has signed a new doctrine for the Russian Navy, which recognizes the United States as the main threat to Russia's position in the world's oceans and calls for increased cooperation with neutral countries. The doctrine, which does not mention Ukraine, claims that Russia is free to use military force should all soft power options be exhausted, adding to the ever-increasing tensions between the West and Russia following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has claimed that Russia is sending some forces currently located in the eastern parts of Ukraine to the country's southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions, adding that the move shows Russia fears a possible counterattack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\nIt's likely that the first ship carrying grain from Ukrainian ports will embark on Monday, said Ibrahim Kalin, a spokesperson for Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, on Sunday. Speaking in an interview with the Turkish broadcaster Kanal 7, Kalin said the joint coordination center in Istanbul will probably complete the final work on the exporting routes very soon. \"If all (details) are completed by tomorrow, it seems like there is a high possibility that the first ship will leave the port tomorrow... We will see ships leaving the ports the next day at the latest,\" he said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has claimed that Ukraine will likely to be able to harvest less than half of last year's crop yield, as the war is making it difficult to conduct agricultural work.

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" (SVO - spetsialnaya voennaya operatsiya) in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the \"Donbass republics\" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.\n\n\"To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.\" [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence reported that, since March, Russian private military company (PMC) Wagner Group has operated in eastern Ukraine in coordination with the Russian military. Wagner has likely been allocated responsibility for specific sectors of the front line, in a similar manner to normal army units.\n\nThis is a significant change from the previous employment of the group since 2015, when it typically undertook missions distinct from overt, large-scale regular Russian military activity.\n\nThis new level of integration further undermines the Russian authorities' long-standing policy of denying links between PMCs and the Russian state. Wagner's role has probably changed because the Russian MoD has a major shortage of combat infantry, however Wagner forces are highly unlikely to be sufficient to make a significant difference in the trajectory of the war.\n\nThe General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that, on July 28-29, a powerful explosion took place in the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region, in the former correctional colony No. 120 in the city of Olenivka, which was being used as a place of detention for Ukrainian prisoners of war. As a result of the explosion, the premises where the captured Ukrainians were located was destroyed. Many Ukrainians were killed and wounded. The explosions took place on the territory of the industrial zone, in a newly built building that was supposed to be specially equipped to hold prisoners taken out of Azovstal. The equipment of the building was finished 2 days ago, after which part of the detained Ukrainian Defenders were transferred to it. According to the Russians, more than 50 Ukrainian defenders were killed, while the number of wounded was unknown. According to Russian comments, not a single employee of the colony, \"DPR\" fighter or Russian military who was guarding the premises was injured in the explosion. Immediately after the explosion, Russia accused Ukraine of shelling the penal colony with U.S. weapons and killing Ukrainian soldiers; a claim immediately denied by Ukraine which stated that it attacks \"only Russian military facilities: warehouses with fuel, weapons and ammunition, command posts, and military infrastructure facilities. The Ukrainian army has enough means to identify targets, including space reconnaissance systems. Ukraine did not fire rockets and artillery at the village of Olenivka\". Moreover, according to Ukraine, \"many documented evidences prove the planned nature of this crime and its commission by the Russian side: in particular, the deliberate transfer of fighters to a new premises shortly before the explosion, analysis of the nature of the damage and the movement of the blast wave, interception of the militants' telephone conversations, the absence of shelling in the specified place, and others. All this leaves no doubt: the explosion in Olenivka was a Russian terrorist act and a gross violation of international agreements.\"\n\nAccording to Ukraine, the explosions in Olenivka, which led to the death of the Ukrainian prisoners, were a deliberate provocation and an undeniable act of terrorism by the occupying forces. According to the information of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, it was carried out by mercenaries from the Wagner\" (League) PMC under the personal command of the nominal owner of the specified private military company - Yevhen Prigozhin. The organization and execution of the terrorist attack were not coordinated with the leadership of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. The main purpose of the terrorist attack was to hide the facts of total embezzlement of funds allocated for the maintenance of Ukrainian prisoners of war. It is known that on August 1, a commission from Moscow was supposed to arrive at the \"object\" to check the expenditure of allocated funds and the conditions of detention of prisoners.\n\nRegarding the general strategic situation, on the Volyn and Polissya directions, the situation was reported to not have changed significantly. There were no signs of the creation of offensive groups of the armed forces of the Russian Federation and the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus.\n\nIn the Siversky direction, the enemy continued to strike infrastructure objects with barrel and rocket artillery in the border areas of Chernihiv and Sumy oblasts. Russian forces also carried out aerial reconnaissance by UAVs near the village of Hremyach, Chernihiv oblast. In the Kharkiv direction, Russian forces shelled the areas of Kharkiv, Rubizhne, Udy, Dementiiivka, Slatyne, Bazaliivka, Peremoha, Mayak, Zamulivka, Lisne, Sosnivka, Svitlychne, Ivanivka, Korobochkyne and other settlements in the Kharkiv direction. They also carried out an airstrike by the forces of army aviation near Stary Saltiv.\n\nIn the Slovyansk direction, Russian forces used barrel, jet artillery and tanks near Dolyna, Bohorodychne, Kurulka, Hrushuvaha, Virnopilla, Sulyhivka and a number of other settlements. Russian army aviation operated near Husarivka. In the Shchurivka area, Ukrainian soldiers discovered and neutralized a Russian reconnaissance group.\n\nIn the Kramatorsk direction, Russian forces shelled, in particular, the districts of Siversk, Ivano-Daryivka, Kryva Luka, Serebryanka, Hryhorivka, Zvanivka, Spirne, and Viimka. The airstrike was recorded near Serebryanka and Spirne. A Russian reconnaissance group was discovered near Verkhnokamyanske, fire damage was inflicted on them, and the group retreated. Russia also carried out aerial reconnaissance by UAVs.\n\nIn the Bakhmut direction, Russian forces shelled military and civilian infrastructure with artillery and tanks in the areas of Shumy, Kodema, Soledar, Bakhmut, Vesela Dolyna, Travneve, Zaitseve, Vershina and other settlements. Airstrikes was conducted near Pokrovske, Novoluhanske, Soledar and Vesela Dolyna.\n\nRussian forces again tried, without success, to storm the Soledar, Vershyna and Semihirya districts.

Ukrainian authorities rejected the narrative as absurd and said the deaths were a premeditated atrocity committed by Russian forces from within the prison, where survivors described being given just enough food to survive and suffering ritual beatings, including with chains and metal pipes.\n\nThe explosion is particularly painful for the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy because many of the dead had fought to defend Mariupol, a port on the Black Sea, and then retreated to the city's Azovstal steelworks. For weeks there, they withstood a Russian onslaught before finally surrendering in May.\n\nFor many Ukrainians, the Azovstal siege became a symbol of the country's suffering and defiance, and the soldiers who fought there, an estimated 2,500 of whom were taken as prisoners of war, have been viewed as heroes.\n\n\"It was a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war,\" Zelenskyy said in an address late Friday.\n\nZelenskyy said that the Red Cross, along with the United Nations, had acted \"as guarantors of the life and health of our soldiers\" and that now they must take action. \"They must protect the lives of hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war,\" he said.\n\nA series of Russian missile strikes on civilian targets, including shopping malls and apartment buildings, has led Ukraine's government to call on Washington to designate Moscow as a state sponsor of terrorism, something Secretary of State Antony Blinken has resisted.\n\nJosep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union's top foreign policy official, said in a statement that every day, Russia's continued \"illegitimate and unjustified war of aggression\" brought \"further horrific atrocities,\" adding that the \"inhumane, barbaric acts\" breached the Geneva Conventions and amounted to war crimes.\n\nKaja Kallas, prime minister of Estonia, a Baltic country that has been among Moscow's toughest antagonists over the war, said Russia was responsible for the \"mass murder\" of prisoners at the camp, an act that she said called to mind \"the darkest chapters of history.\"\n\n\"There must be no impunity for war crimes, just like there can be no return to relations with war criminals,\" she said in a statement.\n\nFor Zelenskyy, the prison explosion fits a pattern in which an unwarranted invasion of his country, ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin, has been accompanied by atrocities committed by Russian forces -- for example, in suburbs north of the capital, Kyiv, and missile strikes on civilian targets, including one this month at a shopping mall in the center of the country far from the front lines.\n\nRussia controls around 20% of Ukraine's territory, but after it deployed its superior artillery power to seize much of Luhansk province in the eastern Donbas region this month, Kyiv is now pressing a counteroffensive in Kherson province in an attempt to reclaim land.\n\nMoscow denies that it has committed atrocities or targeted civilians, and on Saturday, the defense ministry said that Ukrainians had killed their own soldiers using precision-guided, U.S.-made missiles, known as HIMARS, to strike the prison camp in Russian-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine.\n\nMykhailo Podoliak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, told The New York Times that an expert analysis of photos and videos released by Russia indicated that the center of the explosion was inside the building, with the building's exterior practically undamaged.\n\nIn addition, he said that the speed of Russian propaganda after the attack suggested planning. Prisoners had been moved to the barracks where the explosion occurred only days before, and it was suspicious that no Russian soldiers or workers at the prison were injured, he said. Beyond that, he said that Russia, before the explosion, had moved debris to the camp from previous strikes elsewhere that had involved HIMARS weapons.\n\nTetiana Kravchenko, a Ukrainian rights activist whose organization has been in contact with prisoners in the camp, said that a prisoner had called his wife Thursday night and reported hearing an explosion, rather than shelling, around 11 p.m. She said she had a recording of the call, in which the prisoner said that two of his friends had been moved to a different building within the prison on the day of the explosion and that one was now dead and the other wounded.\n\nSoldiers held in other parts of the camp have also relayed similar accounts to their own family members, she said.\n\nThe competing claims could not be immediately independently verified. Kravchenko said she could not disclose more information without risking the safety of prisoners still being held at the camp.\n\nAt its heart, the invasion has killed tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians and brought misery to many more. It has also had far-reaching external consequences, reviving NATO, isolating Russia, raising energy prices and depressing global growth. Given Ukraine's importance to global grain markets and Russia's effective blockade of the country's Black Sea ports, it has also threatened some countries in the Middle East and Africa with food shortages and hunger.\n\nThe first shipments of grain since the beginning of the conflict have been loaded onto freighters at Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea. The shipments would be the fruit of a deal brokered by Turkey and the United Nations around a week ago.

According to the Russian media, 50 Ukrainian PoWs have been killed and 73 have been wounded.\n\nThe Azov Patronage Service has said that it could not confirm or refute these reports and was working to confirm their veracity.\n\nIt has also said that the information regarding the PoWs killed and wounded in Olenivka was being given to the family of each prisoner individually.\n\nBackground:\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War (ISW), in the comment on the Russian shelling of Olenivka, has said that it \"cannot independently assess the nature of the attack or the party responsible for it at this time\" but that the fire damage in Olenivka did no correspond to the sort of damage \"a HIMARS strike would likely have caused\" [in reference to the Russian allegation that Ukrainian forces deliberately struck the Olenivka prison camp using Western-provided HIMARS - ed.]", "source": {"uri": "pravda.com.ua", "dataType": "news", "title": "\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://img.pravda.com/images/doc/1/7/17b7593-lubinec690.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 8, "stanza_neu": 18, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 26, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7134792695", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-31", "time": "18:24:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-31T18:24:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-31T18:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4980392158031464, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/30/world/europe/ukrainian-officials-compile-evidence-that-they-say-shows-russia-was-behind-prison-camp-blast.html", "title": "Ukrainian officials compile evidence that they say shows Russia was behind prison camp blast.", "body": "Ukrainian officials said on Sunday that there is mounting evidence that an explosion at a Russian penal colony that killed dozens of Ukrainian prisoners was ordered and carried out by Russian forces, citing newly released satellite photos as evidence that the soldiers were not killed in a missile strike.\n\nSince the explosion late Thursday at the camp in Russian-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine, both sides have traded accusations over what was the source of the blast that killed at least 50 prisoners, many considered national heroes after being captured during a siege of a steelworks in the coastal city of Mariupol.\n\nWhile the Russian Ministry of Defense said on Sunday it would allow the International Committee for the Red Cross and the United Nations access to the blast site, neither organization confirmed the claim.

Russia said, without offering evidence, that a Ukrainian missile strike caused the explosion.\n\nHere is what we know about the blast, its causes and consequences.\n\nWhat do we know about the camp where the blast hit?\n\nThe explosion ripped through a barracks at Correctional Colony No. 120, a prison camp in the Russian-occupied town of Olenivka in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk Province, on Thursday night at around 11 p.m. The detainees included hundreds of Ukrainian fighters who surrendered in May to Russian forces after making a last stand to defend a steelworks in the port city of Mariupol.\n\nRussia has called many of them war criminals, without providing evidence, while many Ukrainians view them as heroes. There are believed to be at least 2,000 prisoners at the camp, and there have been numerous reports by prisoners, their relatives and human rights groups of torture and abuse. Ukraine's general staff have accused Russia of causing carnage in part to hide evidence of torture and executions at the camp.\n\nGen. Kyrylo Budanov, the commander of Ukraine's military intelligence service, said that construction of the barracks hit by the blast had been completed in an industrial area of the camp just two days before the explosion. Prisoners had only just been moved into them, he said.\n\nWhat do the Ukrainians and Russians say happened that night?\n\nRussia's defense ministry said that Ukraine had used an American-made advanced rocket system, known as a HIMARS, to strike the prison to deter defections, as well as to prevent the prisoners from providing information during interrogations. A senior U.S. military official said that the United States has seen no evidence to support Moscow's claim that a HIMARS munition was used on the barracks.\n\nRussia released photographs and video of the aftermath of the attack showing twisted metal bunk beds and charred bodies. An adviser to Ukraine's president, Mykhailo Podoliak, said that only one building was damaged and photo analysis showed a \"thermobaric explosion from the inside.\"\n\nHe accused Russia of moving debris from previous missile strikes on other targets to the prison camp to make it look like an external attack, saying it was also suspicious that no Russian soldiers or camp workers were injured.\n\nTetiana Katrychenko, an activist whose organization has been in contact with prisoners in the camp, said that one prisoner called his wife on Thursday night at the time of the blast and told her that he heard an explosion, not shelling.

One had died and the other was injured, she said.\n\nUnder the harsh logic that often governs conflict, the remaining detainees hold value to Moscow as a bargaining chip.

Forbes Ukraine's reporters gather information and provide updates on the situation.\n\nSaturday, July 30. Day 157. By Dmytro Aksyonov\n\nKharkiv. A Russian rocket strike on the city of Kharkiv has led to a large-scale fire erupting at a school facility, destroying the building, reports Kharkiv Governor Oleh Synyehubov. No casualties have been reported.\n\nFollowing the Ukrainian government's request to the Red Cross and U.N. after yesterday's explosion at a prison holding Ukrainian prisoners of war in Olenivka, Donetsk region, representatives of both the Red Cross and the U.N. have said they are willing to ensure evacuation for the wounded and, if need be, hold an independent investigation into the source of the explosion, assuming both Ukraine and Russia agree. A representative of the Russian side is yet to comment on the request.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has announced that it is starting a mandatory evacuation campaign for civilians still remaining in the Donetsk region. The heating season is rapidly approaching and they will be unable to guarantee gas supplies to households, as infrastructure in the region has been devastated as a result of Russia's months-long shelling and bombing campaign. Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, who has been placed in charge of managing evacuation campaigns, said that while residents will not be forced to leave their homes if they do not wish to do so, they will be required to sign a mandatory waiver confirming they understand all the risks of staying in the region.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has renewed his calls for Russia to be designated a state sponsor of terrorism by Western countries, in particular the U.S., following an exposion at a Russian prison housing Ukrainian prisoners of war in Olenivka. While Ukrainian officials have been calling for Russia to be designated a state sponsor of terrorism since the start of the war, they have intensified this rhetoric in the last few weeks, adding that such a move would complicate many of Russia's existing political and economic relations. While several countries have officially recognized Russia's invasion as a genocide of Ukrainians, Russia is not currently officially recognized as a state sponsor of terrorism by any country.\n\nRussian gas producer Gazprom announced on Saturday that it had stopped supplying gas to Latvia after accusing the country of violating supply conditions. Russia has already cut off gas supplies to Poland, Bulgaria, Finland, Netherlands and Denmark, which refused to pay for gas in line with an order by President Vladimir Putin requiring rouble accounts to be set up in a Russian bank. Edijs Saicans, deputy state secretary on energy policy at the Latvian Economy Ministry, said the move would have little effect given that Latvia has already decided to ban Russian gas imports from Jan. 1, 2023.\n\nAdding to tensions over energy supply to Europe, a senior manager at the Russian state-owned energy corporation Gazprom said on Friday that the delivery of a Nord Stream 1 gas turbine to Germany from Canada after maintenance was not in line with the contract, Reuters reports. Vitaly Markelov, Gazprom's deputy chief executive, also said that \"Siemens fixed no more than a quarter of the identified bugs''. The European Union disputes Russia's and Gazprom's argument that turbine problems are to blame for the sharp drop in supply through the pipeline that links Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, and has accused Russia of using the EU's dependency on Russian hydrocarbons as blackmail. The shortfall has raised the risk of shortages and gas rationing in Europe this winter.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katya_soldak@forbes.com", "name": "Katya Soldak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/62e5bc1887474877d69932d6/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1200", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 9, "stanza_neu": 16, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 25, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7133868903", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-30", "time": "17:27:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-30T17:27:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-30T17:27:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4941176474094391, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/30/ukraine-donetsk-olenivka-prison-bombing-russia-war", "title": "PoW families wait for news following Donetsk prison attack that killed 50", "body": "Wives of prisoners unsure whether loved ones survived blast in Olenivka as Russia and Ukraine blame each other\n\nThe families of Ukrainian prisoners of war being held in a jail in Russian-occupied Donetsk that was bombed said they are desperate for news.\n\nThe prisoners include members of the Azov battalion who were trapped in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, according to earlier statements by Russia's ministry of defence.

The prisoners should have been protected by guarantees secured by the United Nations and the Red Cross, said Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He joined his foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in urging those organisations to intervene and investigate.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's occupying authorities have blamed the attack on Ukraine, saying it used a US-supplied Himar to strike the facility in order to deter Ukrainian forces who might be considering surrendering. The Twitter account of Russia's embassy in the UK called for Azov's fighters to be executed by hanging rather than firing squad as \"they are not real soldiers\". The statement has been criticised by commentators in the UK.\n\nIt is impossible for the Guardian to verify the versions put forward by either side.\n\nUkraine's western partners appear to be on its side.

The south is key for them, above all because of Crimea,\" he said.\n\nRussian troop movements come in response to Ukraine's declared counteroffensive to liberate the southern occupied regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.\n\nUkrainian forces have retaken dozens of villages and towns along the border, according to the region's military governor, Dmytro Butrii, and are pushing towards Kherson's regional capital.\n\nThe Kherson region stretches across Ukraine's Dnieper river. Earlier this month, Ukraine carried out precision strikes using US-supplied weapons on the Antonovskiy bridge in the Kherson region, damaging a key Russian supply line. Washington's Institute for the Study of War said Ukrainian forces and partisans also damaged the only two other bridges connecting occupied Kherson.\n\nOn Saturday, Ukraine's military said it had killed scores of Russian soldiers and destroyed two ammunition dumps while fighting in Kherson.\n\nTelling residents to stay away from Russian ammunition dumps, the first deputy head of the Kherson regional council, Yuri Sobolevsky, said that the \"Ukrainian army is pouring it on against the Russians, and this is only the beginning\".\n\nAccording to Skibitsky, Russia withdrew tactical groups of airborne forces from Donbas two weeks ago and moved them to occupied Kherson. Russia is also moving troops from its eastern military district, which was being used to attack Sloviansk, a town in Ukrainian-controlled Donetsk, and were in reserve in Russia's southern Belgorod region.\n\nThe open-source investigative group, Conflict Intelligence Team, confirmed Skibitsky's claim in part last week.\n\nMeanwhile, in occupied eastern Ukraine, a prison holding Ukrainian prisoners of war was hit on Thursday night. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has denounced the strike as a \"war crime\", accusing Russia of carrying out the attack to cover up its mistreatment of prisoners. Russia denied responsibility and said Ukrainian forces had struck the prison with rockets. Zelenskiy said at least 50 people died. Ukraine's authorities say they do not yet know the identities of the dead.\n\nDespite moving its tactical battalion groups to the south from the Donbas, Russia would continue to attack in the region, albeit with less intensity, said Skibitsky.\n\nIn the Kharkiv area, he said, Russia was focused on defending positions and stopping Ukrainian forces from reaching the Ukraine-Russia border.\n\nIf Russia won the battles in southern and eastern Ukraine, it would pursue new offensives to capture more Ukrainian territory using units it was currently forming in Russia, said Skibitsky. \"They are currently creating rifle battalions of reservists in each Russian military district and a third army corps in [Russia's] western military district,\" he said.\n\nTraining and equipping of the new corps had begun under the direct supervision of Russia's minister and deputy minister of defence.\n\nWhere Russia used the new corps would depend on how the battle developed in Ukraine's southern and eastern regions, Skibitsky said.\n\nHe warned that one of the Russian army's \"positives\" lay in its ability to move troops and equipment quickly. He said Russia practised this during military exercises leading up to the war and pointed to how the Russian forces retreated from Ukraine's northern regions in March and reappeared in the Donbas two weeks later. \"We know they can return to Belarus in two to three weeks if they need to,\" he said.\n\nSkibitsky said that aside from more weapons, Ukraine needed help training troops abroad. He said that Russia had been actively targeting Ukrainian training bases, giving several examples, including a strike on a military base just north-east of Kyiv that killed 87 Ukrainian soldiers in May.\n\nLast Thursday Russian forces hit a military base north-west of Kyiv, according to Ukraine's armed forces. It was not clear if there were casualties. Ukraine has not disclosed military losses for strategic purposes since the war started.\n\nThe head of MI6, Richard Moore, tweeted on Saturday that Russia was running out of steam after losing dozens of men and that it had been forced to use Soviet-era weapons.\n\nSkibitsky said Russia was running out of high-quality rockets, but he stressed that they had \"a huge amount\" of old, Soviet rockets left in its stockpiles. In the last two months, Russia has been using Soviet anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles on land targets.\n\n\"They are using rockets which are, let's say, past their sell-by date - over 30 years old - so are less effective,\" he said. \"But they have enough of them and any rocket works to scare the population.\"\n\nRussia was ramping up production of new weapons, he added.

Video / AP\n\nThe deaths of more than 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war last week is not only an apparent war crime, but also another sign the situation is becoming a race to the bottom when it comes to international law and conventions.\n\nUkraine and Russia have blamed each other for the attack on the prison in Russian-occupied Donetsk. Ukraine also claims prisoners were being tortured and murdered there. Russia's British embassy later posted on Twitter that Ukrainian Azov Regiment soldiers deserved a \"humiliating death\" by hanging.\n\nBut amid the accusations and counter-accusations of atrocities being committed against prisoners of war, some simple facts are easily overlooked: rules already exist to prevent such horrors, and they apply in Ukraine.\n\nPrisoners of war are explicitly covered by the Third Geneva Convention, drawn up in 1949 to replace the old Prisoners of War Convention of 1929 after the awful lessons of World War II.\n\nBoth Russia and Ukraine are signatories, meaning they have promised to respect it in all circumstances. It's important to note this is not the protocol of the Geneva Conventions Russian President Vladimir Putin recently quit.\n\nRestraint during a war isn't easy, but it is essential nonetheless. As well as respecting basic humanity and honour, the rules - which have operated for over 100 years - help combatants build the confidence to eventually find peace.\n\nIn the sense that it helps avoid escalating revenge and reprisal for attacks against the defenceless, respect for prisoners of war is also a pragmatic act of self-interest.\n\nAdherence in Ukraine to the fundamental conditions of the Geneva Convention has been hard to gauge, however. Apart from occasional exchanges of prisoners of war, exactly how many prisoners have been taken by each side, and where they are held, remains largely unknown.\n\nWhile the Red Cross has been able to visit some POWs and other detainees, it has not been granted access to visit them all. The problem is compounded by claims that some combatants taken on the battlefield are mercenaries and therefore do not count as prisoners of war, meaning they may be executed.\n\nFurther complicating things is that both sides are promising to put prisoners on trial for war crimes. With Russia holding over 1,100 Ukrainian prisoners and Ukraine making over 15,000 allegations of war crimes, both parties need to publicly re-pledge to the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war before things escalate.\n\nThe basic rules governing the treatment of prisoners of war are simple enough to state:\n\nBeyond these rules, representatives from third-party countries or the Red Cross should be permitted to visit and interview (without witnesses) prisoners and their legal representatives.\n\nAnd any disputes about the application of the convention rules should be resolved through an enquiry by an independent third party.\n\nIt's the handling of war trials in particular that requires most restraint. Although prisoners cannot be tried simply for fighting against their enemy, the Geneva Convention allows trials for grave breaches of the laws of war (such as murder or torture) - and even the death penalty if the domestic law of the detaining power includes it.\n\nAnd despite judicial safeguards relating to fairness and the rights and means of legal defence, there is still the risk of a tit-for-tat process: one side finds a prisoner guilty, the other side responds in kind.\n\nThe best way through this is to allow the International Criminal Court (already pursuing its own investigations into the situation in Ukraine) to take the lead, giving the process real independence and integrity.\n\nfrom the International Criminal Court - just another measure of how far the observation of the laws of war has been eroded in Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/8ZHsHaaX3n4zhDHImGc96qUrfjo=/1200x675/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/5CW4GGICYLSER7ALFATVUQQ564.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 22, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 27, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7133358541", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-30", "time": "06:28:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-30T06:28:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-30T06:25:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.47843137383461, "url": "https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2022/07/29/7360970/", "title": "Zelenskyy on Olenivka shelling: UN and ICRC must address this war crime", "body": "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross to protect the lives of hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war and has called on the world to recognise Russia a terrorist state.\n\nSource: Zelenskyy's video address\n\nQuote: \"I heard reports today about the occupiers' attack on Olenivka, Donetsk region.

Also, 203 Ukrainian children are reported missing. Moreover, Russian occupiers forcibly deported or displaced about 5,754 Ukrainian children, says Daria Herasymchuk, adviser and commissioner of the President of Ukraine's Rights of Children and Children's Rehabilitation program.\n\nKharkiv. Russian forces continue their shelling and bombing campaign on Kharkiv and the Kharkiv region. A shelling attack struck a bus stop in the city of Kharkiv which led to one civilian being killed and one more being hospitalized, according to Kharkiv Governor Oleh Synyehubov. Additionally, Western experts warn that Russia may be regrouping forces with the possible intention of conducting offensive maneuvers in the region.\n\nDnipro. The Dnipropetrovsk region has been hit by Russian shelling over 60 times in the past 24 hours, reports Dnipropetrovsk Governor Valentyn Reznychenko. Two civilians are reportedly injured after the attacks and more than 13 private houses have been rendered unlivable as a result of the shelling.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, Russian troops shelled a number of Ukrainian regions, including Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Sumy, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Luhansk, and Kherson regions. As a result of the attacks, six people have been killed and 25 have been injured, according to Ukraine's Regional Military Administrations.\n\nThe Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed a Russian ammunition depot in the city of Skadovsk in the Kherson region on August 1, according to Serhii Khlan, adviser to the head of the Kherson Regional Military Administration.\n\nThe first ship with Ukrainian grain has left the Ukrainian port of Odesa since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, following a deal between Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, and the U.N. to unblock Ukrainian grain exports, reports the Ukrainian Minister of Infrastructure, Oleksandr Kubrakov. He added that the ship, which is named RAZONI and flies the flag of Sierra Leone, is expected to arrive in Turkey tomorrow, and that 16 more ships are currently awaiting the go-ahead to leave Ukrainian ports.\n\nThe European Union has provided Ukraine with a financial grant worth \u20ac500 million; half of an overall package worth \u20ac1 billion. The second half of the grant is expected to arrive tomorrow, announced Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Smyhal. The aid package is part of a long-term financial plan for Ukraine by compiled by EU member states worth \u20ac9 billion. While Ukraine has received a large amount of external financial aid, some observers worry that the aid is arriving too slowly and in numbers too small to truly help the country sustain its war economy and avoid a formal default.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden has expressed a desire to work together with his Russian and Chinese counterparts to create a new framework to control nuclear weapon proliferation following the scheduled end of the New START treaty that is in effect until 2026. \"My Administration is ready to expeditiously negotiate a new arms control framework to replace New START when it expires in 2026,\" Biden said. \"But negotiation requires a willing partner operating in good faith.\" \"...Russia should demonstrate that it is ready to resume work on nuclear arms control with the United States,\" he said.\n\nRussia has announced sanctions against 39 British politicians, officials, business people and journalists; barring them from entering the country for supporting the \"demonisation\" of Russia.\n\nAmong the targeted individuals are opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer, former prime minister David Cameron and controversial TV journalist Piers Morgan.

Among the equipment destroyed in the attack were two armored personnel carriers, three Ural trucks and Russian artillery.\n\nIt is unclear when and where the attack occurred. The SSU also did not specify whether any Russian soldiers died in the attack.\n\nLast week, the SSU said it destroyed two Russian SU-25s, also known as Frogfoot in the West.

Here's today's news.\n\nU.S. RELATIONS\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and several other Congress members have arrived in Singapore. The delegation started their two-day visit to the city-state by meeting Singaporean President Halimah Yacob, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, Singapore's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. During the meeting, they discussed U.S.-Singapore cooperation on a number of issues, including the climate crisis and economic development, according to the statement. The visit to Singapore is the first official stop in a high-profile Asia tour that has attracted international attention over speculation that Pelosi may visit Taiwan. Jessie Yeung reports for CNN.\n\nChina has said today that its military will \"not sit idly by\" if Pelosi visits Taiwan. The latest warning was issued during a Chinese foreign ministry regular briefing. Spokesperson Zhao Lijian also said that because of Pelosi's status as the \"No. 3 official of the U.S. government\", a visit to Taiwan, which China claims as its own, would \"lead to egregious political impact\". Reuters reports.\n\nChina's People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted \"live-fire exercises\" on Saturday in Pingtan, a coastal area about 125km from Taiwan. The exercises mark an escalation in threats over Pelosi's potential visit to Taiwan later this week. State media also broadcast footage of a Chinese destroyer firing its weapons in the South China Sea, which the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier group is believed to be sailing through after visiting Singapore. China's Maritime Safety Administration has warned vessels that the PLA will conduct more live-fire exercises in another area of the South China Sea on Aug. 2 and Aug. 3. Tom Mitchell and Demetri Sevastopulo report for the Financial Times.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE - GRAIN SHIPMENTS\n\nThe first grain ship to leave the Ukrainian port of Odesa under a U.N.-brokered deal to ensure safe passage through the Black Sea departed this morning. The ship, the Razoni, was led by a government vessel through a maze of mines that had been laid by Ukrainian forces to forestall any attempt by Moscow to launch an assault on Odesa. A rescue ship followed and Russia's Navy, which controls the Black Sea, granted safe passage. The Razoni, which has been stuck in port since Feb. 18, was carrying 26,000 metric tons of corn, the U.N. said. There are 16 more ships waiting to leave Odesa in the coming days, according to Ukraine's infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kurbakov. The New York Times reports.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has praised the departure of the first grain shipment from Odesa. \"We welcome the departure of the first vessel from Ukraine's Black Sea ports since Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb 24,\" the embassy said in a tweet. \"The world will be watching for continued implementation of this agreement to feed people around the world with millions of tons of trapped Ukrainian grain.\" U.S. Ambassador Bridget A. Brink called the development \"progress.\" Olga Voitovych, Vasco Cotovio and Jo Shelley report for CNN.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE - OLENIVKA DETENTION CENTER BOMBING\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia of a \"war crime\" for bombing a detention center containing Ukrainian prisoners of war in Olenivka. Zelenskyy called on international organizations and the U.S. to take action and investigate Russia. \"There should be a clear legal recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism,\" Zelenskyy said. The Ukrainian president specifically called on the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross (I.C.R.C), saying those bodies \"must react\" to the bombing. More than 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war died in the shelling in the town of Olenivka, in territory controlled by Moscow-backed separatists since 2014, according to authorities in the Donetsk People's Republic. Giorgio Leali reports for POLITICO.\n\nThe E.U. should designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds has said. \"We see all the brutality of Russian forces, that actually resemble a lot of ISIS, who we have been always calling a terrorist organization,\" Rink\u0113vi\u010ds told POLITICO in a phone interview. \"Let's call a spade a spade,\" he said. Rink\u0113vi\u010ds' remarks come after an attack that killed dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war. Ukraine's military has accused Russia of deliberately shelling a jail containing Ukrainian POWs in the eastern Donetsk region, while Russia's Defense Ministry has accused Ukraine of striking the prison. Lili Bayer reports for POLITICO.\n\nThe I.C.R.C has not received confirmation that it will be allowed to visit the detention center in Olenivka, the organization said in a statement yesterday. This is despite Russia's claim that it had formally invited both the U.N. and the I.C.R.C to investigate. In its statement, the I.C.R.C noted that all parties to the conflict have an obligation under international law to give the I.C.R.C access to prisoners of war. \"We are ready to deploy to Olenivka,\" the I.C.R.C. said, adding that it already had medical, forensic and humanitarian teams in the vicinity. \"It is imperative that the I.C.R.C. be granted immediate access to the Olenivka facility, and other places where the wounded and dead might have been transferred.\" The New York Times reports.\n\nRUSSIA, UKRAINE - OTHER DEVELOPMENTS\n\nThe southern region of Mykolaiv came under intense shelling last night, with Russian forces hitting several civilian buildings including a hospital trauma center, Ukrainian officials have said. \"Tonight, Russian terrorists cynically fired at a number of civilian objects in Mykolaiv. Among them is our modern, brand-new trauma center,\" Mykolaiv Mayor Oleksandr Senkevych said. Olga Voitovych reports for CNN.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced mandatory evacuation from the Donetsk region. In his nightly address on Saturday Zelenskyy called on the remaining residents to leave the region urgently in what he called a \"government decision.\" The government has created a coordination center to help evacuate the residents of Donetsk to safer parts of Ukraine, Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine's deputy prime minister, told reporters earlier on Saturday. The evacuation will be carried out by trains and by buses, and those who refuse to evacuate will have to sign \"a certain form of refusal from mandatory evacuation\" stating they understand and are aware of all the consequences of staying in the combat zones and bear personal responsibility for their lives, Vereshchuk added. Mariya Knight reports for CNN.\n\nAmnesty International and the E.U. have joined Kyiv in calling for an investigation into footage that appears to show pro-Russian forces castrating and executing a captive Ukrainian fighter. \"This horrific assault is yet another apparent example of complete disregard for human life and dignity in Ukraine committed by Russian forces,\" Marie Struthers, Amnesty International's director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said. The E.U. top diplomat Josep Borrell also described the footage as an example of \"inhumane, barbaric acts\" that amount to war crimes. \"The European Union condemns in the strongest possible terms the atrocities committed by the Russian armed forces and their proxies,\" he said. Dalton Bennett and Ellen Francis report for the Washington Post.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin yesterday signed a new naval doctrine, casting the U.S. as Russia's main rival and setting out Russia's global maritime ambitions. The 55-page naval doctrine says Russia will aim to become a \"great maritime navy\" with a presence across the world to counter the \"strategic policy of the USA to dominate the world's oceans.\" \"Guided by this doctrine, the Russian Federation will firmly and resolutely defend its national interests in the world's oceans, and having sufficient maritime power will guarantee their security and protection,\" the doctrine reads. It also says Russia will expand its ambitions in the Arctic Ocean - something the U.S. has previously warned of. Brad Dress reports for The Hill.\n\nOTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nA dispute over license plates between Kosovo and Serbia yielded protests and gunfire yesterday night. The demonstrations come on the eve of a new law requiring ethnic Serbs living in Kosovo to switch from Serbian license plates to Kosovar ones in the next two months. Kosovo's government had also said that beginning today, all Serbian ID and passport holders must obtain an extra document to enter Kosovo, just as Kosovars must do to enter Serbia. After a meeting with the U.S. ambassador, Kosovo's government announced it would delay the implementation of both the license plate and identification decisions by one month. However, the unrest has prompted fears of further violence, with NATO saying that its peacekeeping forces in Kosovo were \"ready to intervene if stability is jeopardized.\" Valerie Hopkins reports for the New York Times.\n\nThousands of protesters rallied in the Sudanese capital Khartoum yesterday to call for an end to military rule. Clashes erupted after hundreds of demonstrators attempted to head to the Republican Palace -- Sudan's presidential offices -- but were met by police, who responded by firing tear gas at the protesters. The protests follow a CNN investigation which uncovered evidence of a gold operation siphoning Sudanese wealth to Russia to boost its war effort in Ukraine and Russian collusion with the military leadership of Sudan. Nima Elbagir reports for CNN.\n\nInfluential Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has called for a change in Iraq's constitution and election procedures a day after his supporters occupied its parliament building. In a statement released on Twitter, Sadr called the takeover of the parliament a \"revolution\" and an \"opportunity for radical change\" in the political process that shouldn't be wasted. Sadr's demands for change are likely to intensify tensions between him and his rival for power, former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. In a statement, the Coalition Framework, the alliance of Iranian-backed Shiite parties aligned with Maliki, rejected Sadr's demands, calling them \"a coup against the legitimate system.\" David S. Cloud and Ghassan Adnan report for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIran has the technical capability to produce an atomic bomb but has no intention of doing so, Mohammad Eslami, head of the country's atomic energy organisation, has said. Eslami reiterated comments made by Kamal Kharrazi, a senior adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in July. Kharrazi's remarks amounted to a rare suggestion that the Islamic Republic might have an interest in nuclear weapons, which it has long denied seeking. \"As Mr. Kharrazi mentioned, Iran has the technical ability to build an atomic bomb, but such a program is not on the agenda,\" said Eslami. Reuters reports.\n\nDOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS - JAN. 6 ATTACK\n\nIn its next round of public hearings in September, the Jan. 6 committee is expected to focus on the intelligence and law enforcement failures of the FBI and Department of Homeland Security. Those failures, which left police underprepared for the attack on the Capitol, will also be a key component of the committee's final report. \"The team has conducted more than 100 interviews and depositions touching on these matters of security and intelligence across several federal and local agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security, Fusion Centers, Office of Intelligence & Analysis, among others,\" a committee aide told NBC News. \"The team is looking into what intelligence these agencies had at their disposal; how that intelligence was analyzed, stitched together, and distributed; and whether law enforcement operationalized that intelligence,\" he added. There's a limited time frame to help call attention to the need to fix the intelligence failures. If Republicans take back the House in the midterms, as many analysts expect, oversight could very quickly turn from examining FBI shortcomings to investigating alleged law enforcement overreach against those involved in the Jan. 6 attack. Ryan J. Reilly reports for NBC News.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) chief watchdog scrapped its investigative team's efforts to try to recover deleted Secret Service texts from around the time of the Jan. 6 attack. In February of this year, after learning that the Secret Service's text messages had been erased as part of a migration to new devices, staff at Inspector General Joseph V. Cuffari's office planned to contact all DHS agencies offering to have data specialists help retrieve messages from their phones, according to two government whistleblowers who provided reports to Congress. But later that month, Cuffari's office decided it would not collect or review any agency phones, according to three people briefed on the decision. The latest revelation comes as Democratic lawmakers have accused Cuffari's office of failing to aggressively investigate the agency's actions in response to the violent attack on the Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump on Jan. 6, 2021. Maria Sacchetti and Carol D. Leonnig report for the Washington Post.\n\nOTHER DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS\n\nA New York man has been arrested near the home of an Iranian dissident who was previously the target of an alleged kidnapping plot by the Iranian government, according to people familiar with the matter. Khalid Mehdiyev, 23 years old, was arrested in Brooklyn after New York Police Department officers pulled him over for running a stop sign and found a suitcase containing a loaded AK-47-style assault rifle, according to a criminal complaint filed Friday in Manhattan federal court. A Federal Bureau of Investigation agent said in the complaint that surveillance video and other records showed that over two days last week Mehdiyev parked for hours near a Brooklyn residence occupied by Iranian dissident Masih Alinejad. James Fanelli reports for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Justice Department has charged Russian man Aleksandr Viktorovich with conspiring to have American citizens act as illegal agents of the Russian government. Ionov, 32, who lives in Moscow and is not in custody, is accused of recruiting three political groups in Florida, Georgia and California from December 2014 through March 2022, providing them with financial support and directing them to publish Russian propaganda. David Walker, the top agent in the F.B.I.'s Tampa field office, called the allegations \"some of the most egregious and blatant violations we've seen by the Russian government in order to destabilize and undermine trust in American democracy.\" On Friday, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions against him. Patrica Mazzei reports for the New York Times.\n\nThe House on Friday passed a bill to ban the sale of assault-style weapons largely on party lines. The bill passed with a vote of 217-213, with 215 Democrats and two Republicans voting for the legislation, and 208 Republicans and five Democrats voting against. The bill isn't likely to move forward in the 50-50 Senate for a vote, as it would almost certainly fail to get the 60 votes required to overcome a filibuster. However, the vote provided a way for Democrats to demonstrate to voters before the midterm elections their resolve to tackle gun violence in America. In a statement on Friday evening, President Biden applauded the House's passage of the assault weapons ban. Annie Karni and Julian E. Barnes report for the New York Times.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 has infected over 90.05 million people and has now killed over 1.03 million people in the United States, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Globally, there have been over 566.846million confirmed coronavirus cases and over 6.38 million deaths.

According to the investigation, approximately 40 people died and another 130 were injured. The self-proclaimed \"DPR\" reported 53 dead Ukrainians and 75 wounded.\n\nA criminal case was opened over the violation of the laws and customs of war (Part 2 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine).\n\nThe SBU intercepted telephone conversations in which the representatives of the \"DPR\" confirm that the Russian troops are to blame for this tragedy. According to the intercepts, Russians could have place explosives inside the colony. In particular, none of the eyewitnesses heard a characteristic whistle from the rocket: the explosions occurred by themselves.\n\nAccording to the leaked conversations, the Russian army placed Grad systems near the colony and started firing from them on the territory controlled by Ukraine.

The leader of the unrecognized \"DPR\" Denis Pushilin said that the shelling could have happened because the prisoners \"began to testify.\"\n\nThe General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has denied launching rocket and artillery strikes on the area of the settlement of Olenivka. The army command believes that Russians are committing war crimes in order to \"cover up the torture of prisoners and executions carried out there on the orders of the occupation administration and the command of the Russian Armed Forces.\"\n\nThe adviser to the head of the President's Office, Mykhailo Podolyak, emphasized that there are no operational military objectives for the Ukrainian army in Olenivka, and the scale and speed of the information campaign of Russian propagandists indicate that this was precisely the planned action of the Russian Federation.\n\nThe Patronage Service of the Azov regiment is currently establishing the names of the dead and injured. The International Committee of the Red Cross has also set off for the colony.\n\nNot a shelling, but an explosion?\n\nThe Media Initiative for Human Rights is trying to establish the circumstances of the explosion. Their sources assure that there was no shelling of the territory of the colony on July 28, but there was an explosion. They note that the sound of the approach, characteristic of shelling, was not heard.\n\nSources claim that an explosion was heard in Olenivka in the evening of July 28, and ambulances came to the colony at night and in the morning. Other sources say that the explosion occurred when some of the prisoners of war were near the barracks outside. After it, everyone was ordered indoors, but many heard screams from outside.\n\nThe MIHR has received an approximate plan of the territory of the colony. The barrack in which the explosion occurred could be located in the technical zone, which is called \"promka\".

Serhiy Haidai saying on Monday that the shelling hit settlements on the administrative border with the Donetsk region.\n\nRussian forces carried out five missile strikes and four rounds of shelling in the area, Haidai said.\n\nThe Luhansk and Donetsk regions together make up Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland known as Donbas, where separatist rebels have fought Ukrainian forces since 2014.\n\nEarlier this month, Russia captured the last major stronghold of Ukrainian resistance in Luhansk, the city of Lysychansk.\n\nAfter the seizure of Lysychansk, some analysts predicted Moscow's troops likely would take some time to rearm and regroup, but Ukrainian officials said there has been no pause in attacks.\n\nThe British military assessed that Russian troops weren't getting needed breaks.\n\nThe Defense Ministry tweeted Monday that online videos suggested at least one tank brigade in the war was \"mentally and physically exhausted\" as they had been on active combat duty since the start of the war on Feb. 24.\n\nThe British said: \"The lack of scheduled breaks from intense combat conditions is highly likely one of the most damaging of the many personnel issues the Russian (Ministry of Defense) is struggling to rectify amongst the deployed force.\"\n\nAlso on Monday, the main Russian gas pipeline to Germany began a 10-day closure for maintenance amid European fears that Moscow may not turn the flow back on after its completion.\n\n(The Associated Press)", "source": {"uri": "thehoopsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hoops News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.thehoopsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wp-header-logo-8316.png", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 29, "stanza_neu": 139, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 171, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7132437014", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "10:58:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T10:58:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T10:34:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4549019634723663, "url": "https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/849302.html", "title": "AFU does not launch missile strikes on Olenivka; Russia carries out targeted deliberate shelling of pretrial detention facility, where Ukrainian prisoners also kept - AFU", "body": "The Russian armed forces carried out targeted artillery shelling of a pretrial detention facility in Olenivka, Donetsk region, where Ukrainian prisoners were kept, statements about alleged shelling by the Armed Forces of Ukraine are an outright lie and a provocation, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) said.\n\n\"The Russian armed forces carried out targeted deliberate artillery shelling of a pretrial detention facility in the village of Olenivka, Donetsk region, where Ukrainian prisoners were kept.

a torment that compounds their fury: uncertainty.\n\nThe Russian government, which blames Ukraine for the strike, produced a list of 50 prisoners who it said had died at the Olenivka camp in Donetsk Province, eastern Ukraine. But evidence that Ukraine says shows the bombing was an inside job has further fueled mistrust of the Russians after five months of fighting.\n\nAs a result, many relatives are waiting for independent confirmation of casualties.\n\nThe Russian list included the name of Vlad, 28, a member of the regiment that fought to defend the Azovstal steel factory in the port city of Mariupol. Anastasia Kavulich, a friend, also 28, said she had seen evidence that he had been killed, though that had not been confirmed by either the Ukrainian authorities or his family.\n\n\"Vlad died that night,\" she said in an extensive post on Instagram. \"We were supposed to see each other after the victory,\" she said, and added: \"I don't know how to say goodbye.\" She requested that his full name not be used because of the uncertainty of the situation.\n\nMany Ukrainians believe the decision by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to invade their country in February is a war crime. Since then, Ukrainians have been appalled by Russia's attacks on civilian targets and by other atrocities.\n\nBut the attack on the prison camp is seen as particularly horrible because the fighters, many of whom are seen as national heroes, had surrendered to Russian forces as prisoners of war and were protected by the Geneva Conventions.\n\n\"I just want to howl from my own powerlessness and helplessness,\" said Alina Mykhailova, a Ukrainian soldier, in a post on Twitter.\n\nIna, who asked to use only her first name for fear of retribution, said she believed her brother and his wife, both of whom were fighters at the Azovstal plant, were being held in Olenivka, but she did not know for sure.\n\n\"How can we know that the same will not happen to others?\" she asked. \"Who can guarantee that they will not shell it again?\"\n\nKateryna Prokopenko, whose husband, Denys Prokopenko, is a commander of the Azov Regiment, said that a \"line was crossed\" with the attack.

Ukraine also claims prisoners were being tortured and murdered there. Russia's British embassy later posted on Twitter that Ukrainian Azov battalion soldiers deserved a \"humiliating death\" by hanging.\n\nBut amid the accusations and counter-accusations of atrocities being committed against prisoners of war, some simple facts are easily overlooked: rules already exist to prevent such horrors, and they apply in Ukraine.\n\nPrisoners of war are explicitly covered by the Third Geneva Convention, drawn up in 1949 to replace the old Prisoners of War Convention of 1929 after the awful lessons of the second world war.\n\nBoth Russia and Ukraine are signatories, meaning they have promised to respect it in all circumstances. It's important to note this is not the protocol of the Geneva Conventions Russian President Vladimir Putin recently quit.\n\nFog of war\n\nRestraint during a war isn't easy, but it is essential nonetheless. As well as respecting basic humanity and honour, the rules - which have operated for over 100 years - help combatants build the confidence to eventually find peace.\n\nIn the sense that it helps avoid escalating revenge and reprisal for attacks against the defenceless, respect for prisoners of war is also a pragmatic act of self-interest.\n\nAdherence in Ukraine to the fundamental conditions of the Geneva Convention has been hard to gauge, however. Apart from occasional exchanges of prisoners of war, exactly how many prisoners have been taken by each side, and where they are held, remains largely unknown.\n\nRead more: Russia says peace in Ukraine will be 'on our terms' - but what can the West accept and at what cost?\n\nWhile the Red Cross has been able to visit some POWs and other detainees, it has not been granted access to visit them all.

Ukraine also claims prisoners were being tortured and murdered there. Russia's British embassy later posted on Twitter that Ukrainian Azov battalion soldiers deserved a \"humiliating death\" by hanging.\n\nBut amid the accusations and counter-accusations of atrocities being committed against prisoners of war, some simple facts are easily overlooked: rules already exist to prevent such horrors, and they apply in Ukraine.\n\nPrisoners of war are explicitly covered by the Third Geneva Convention, drawn up in 1949 to replace the old Prisoners of War Convention of 1929 after the awful lessons of the second world war.\n\nBoth Russia and Ukraine are signatories, meaning they have promised to respect it in all circumstances. It's important to note this is not the protocol of the Geneva Conventions Russian President Vladimir Putin recently quit.\n\nRestraint during a war isn't easy, but it is essential nonetheless. As well as respecting basic humanity and honour, the rules - which have operated for over 100 years - help combatants build the confidence to eventually find peace.\n\nIn the sense that it helps avoid escalating revenge and reprisal for attacks against the defenceless, respect for prisoners of war is also a pragmatic act of self-interest.\n\nAdherence in Ukraine to the fundamental conditions of the Geneva Convention has been hard to gauge, however. Apart from occasional exchanges of prisoners of war, exactly how many prisoners have been taken by each side, and where they are held, remains largely unknown.\n\nRead more:\n\nRussia says peace in Ukraine will be 'on our terms' - but what can the West accept and at what cost?\n\nWhile the Red Cross has been able to visit some POWs and other detainees, it has not been granted access to visit them all.

US finds it's hard to shun Russia\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration likes to say Russia has become isolated internationally because of its invasion of Ukraine. Yet Moscow's top officials have hardly been cloistered in the Kremlin. And now, even the U.S. wants to talk.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has been meeting with world leaders, including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose country is a NATO member. Meanwhile, his top diplomat, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, is jetting around the world, smiling, shaking hands and posing for photos with foreign leaders -- including some friends of the U.S.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he wants to end months of top-level U.S. diplomatic estrangement with Lavrov to discuss the release of American detainees as well as issues related to Ukraine. The call has not been scheduled but is expected in coming days.\n\nThe handshakes and phone calls cast doubt on a core part of the U.S. strategy aimed at ending the Ukraine war: that diplomatic and economic isolation, along with battlefield setbacks, would ultimately force Russia to send its troops home.\n\nEven as he announced plans for the call, Blinken continued to insist Russia is indeed isolated. He argued the travel of its top officials is purely damage control and a reaction to international criticism Moscow is facing for the Ukraine war.\n\nFlooding in central Appalachia kills at least 8 in Kentucky\n\nJACKSON, Ky. (AP) -- Krystal Holbrook's family started moving possessions to higher ground long before dawn, racing to save them from the rapidly rising floodwaters that were menacing southeastern Kentucky.\n\nHer family scurried in the dark to move vehicles, campers, trailers and equipment. But as the water kept rising Thursday -- leaving at least eight people dead and hundreds without homes in Kentucky -- they began to worry that they might run out of higher ground.\n\n\"We felt we had most of it moved out of the way,\" Holbrook said. \"But right now, we're still moving vehicles even to higher ground. Higher ground is getting a little bit difficult.\"\n\nThe same was true throughout the region, as another round of rainfall loomed in an area already hammered by days of torrential rainfall. The storm sent water gushing from hillsides and surging out of streambeds in Appalachia, inundating homes, businesses and roads. Rescue crews used helicopters and boats to pick up people trapped by floodwaters. Parts of western Virginia and southern West Virginia were also hit by flooding.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear asked for prayers as the region braced for more rain.\n\nChina's Xi warns Biden over Taiwan, calls for cooperation\n\nBEIJING (AP) -- President Xi Jinping warned against meddling in China's dealings with Taiwan during a phone call with his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, that gave no indication of progress on trade, technology or other irritants, including Beijing's opposition to a top American lawmaker's possible visit to the island that the mainland claims as its own territory.\n\nXi also warned against splitting the world's two biggest economies, according to a Chinese government summary of Thursday's unusually lengthy, three-hour call. Businesspeople and economists warn such a change, brought on by Chinese industrial policy and U.S. curbs on technology exports, might hurt the global economy by slowing innovation and increasing costs.\n\nMeanwhile, Xi and Biden are looking at the possibility of meeting in person, according to a U.S. official who declined to be identified further. Xi has been invited to Indonesia in November for a meeting of the Group of 20 major economies, making it a potential location for a face-to-face meeting.\n\nThe Chinese government gave no indication Xi and Biden discussed possible plans by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to visit Taiwan, which the ruling Communist Party says has no right to conduct foreign relations. But Xi rejected \"interference by external forces\" that might encourage Taiwan to try to make its decades-old de facto independence permanent.\n\nThe tough language from Xi, who usually tries to appear to be above political disputes and makes blandly positive public comments, suggested Chinese leaders might believe Washington didn't understand the seriousness of previous warnings about Taiwan.\n\nFor Taiwan, Pelosi visit is about US, China controlling risk\n\nTAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The crisis sparked by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's potential visit to Taiwan misses a key point, experts say: that the real focus should be on how the United States and China manage their differences so the risks of confrontation don't spiral out of control.\n\nNews of a possible visit by Pelosi has set off intense speculation about China's potential diplomatic and military responses. But for Taiwan, the visit -- if it occurs -- would be merely the latest point of strife in an already tense situation that has shadowed the island democracy for decades.\n\n\"The main point is not in Pelosi coming to Taiwan, but it's to look at how the U.S. and China effectively control the risks that may arise,\" said Arthur Zhin-Sheng Wang, a defense studies expert at Taiwan's Central Police University.\n\nWang said that Thursday's call between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping was an example of how the two sides can manage their differences through dialogue. The fact that it occurred amid the debate over Pelosi visiting Taiwan was a sign of at least a \"basic level of mutual understanding,\" he said.\n\nTaiwan, meanwhile, has continued to strike a balance between the two superpowers mainly by keeping quiet, even as tensions have risen.\n\nBasement talk, virtual handshake led to Manchin-Schumer deal\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin secreted themselves in a basement room at the Capitol.\n\nThe two men had been wrestling for more than a year in long, failed rounds of start-and-stop negotiations over President Joe Biden's big rebuilding America package. But talks had jammed up -- again. With the midterm elections near, control of Congress at stake, the president and his party were at the end of the line.\n\nJust four days earlier, Manchin had issued his latest ultimatum: Either scale back the ambitious proposal by dropping the climate change provisions that were so important to Biden and his party, or wait until September to try to pass any bill at all, giving the economy's shocking 9.1% inflation a chance to cool.\n\nWith all avenues with his colleague exhausted, Schumer signaled to Biden they needed to do whatever they could before lawmakers left town for the summer break. From the White House, Biden had announced that it was time to make a deal.\n\nAnd Manchin faced his own political pressures. Outraged colleagues openly criticized his tactics as insincere -- whispering, even, that the West Virginia senator should have his gavel taken away as a committee chairman. The coal state conservative was being publicly singled out, shamed even, as the sole figure stopping help for a planet in peril.\n\nInflation hits record 8.9% in 19 countries using the euro\n\nBRUSSELS (AP) -- Inflation in the European countries using the euro currency shot up to another record in July, pushed by higher energy prices driven partly by Russia's war in Ukraine, but the economy still managed some meager growth.\n\nAnnual inflation in the eurozone's 19 countries rose to 8.9% in July, an increase from 8.6% in June, according to the latest numbers published Friday by the European Union statistics agency. Inflation has been running at its highest level since 1997, when record-keeping for the euro began.\n\nEnergy prices surged by 39.7%, slightly lower than the previous month, while prices for food, alcohol and tobacco rose by 9.8%, faster than the increase posted last month.\n\nThe eurozone's economy, meanwhile, grew from April through June, expanding by 0.7% compared with the previous quarter and up 4% over the same period in 2021.\n\nThat contrasts with the United States, whose the economy has contracted for two straight quarters, raising fears of a recession with inflation at 40-year highs. But the job market is even stronger than before the COVID-19 pandemic, and most economists, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, have said they don't think the economy is in recession.\n\nIn a Nevada county, election conspiracies sow deep distrust\n\nTONOPAH, Nev. (AP) -- The Nye County Commission is used to dealing with all sorts of hot-button controversies.\n\nWater rights, livestock rules and marijuana licenses are among the many local dramas that consume the time of the five commissioners in this vast swath of rural and deeply Republican Nevada. Last spring, it was something new: voting machines.\n\nFor months, conspiracy theories fueled on social media by those repeating lies about former President Donald Trump's loss in 2020 inflamed public suspicions about whether election results could be trusted. In response, the commission put a remarkable item on its agenda: Ditch the county's voting machines and instead count every vote on every ballot -- more than 20,000 in a typical general election -- entirely by hand.\n\nCommissioners called a parade of witnesses, including three from out of state who insisted voting machines could be hacked and votes flipped without leaving a trace. They said no county could be certain their machines weren't accessible via the internet and open to tampering by nefarious actors.\n\nIt was all just too much for Sam Merlino, a Republican who has spent more than two decades administering elections as the county's clerk. She simply felt outgunned.\n\nWomen's soccer energizes England in a league of their own\n\nLONDON (AP) -- Izzy Short, 13, struggles to pick her favorite England player as she anticipates the team's appearance in Sunday's final of the European soccer championships.\n\nThere's forward Ellen White. Defender Lucy Bronze. Midfielder Georgia Stanway. Captain Leah Williamson. The whole team basically.\n\n\"I just look up to them really,'' the high school player from Manchester said, excitement filling her voice. \"They are all very positive ... they all, like, appreciated one another and how they are such a good team and all of them just working together really. And they're just so kind and so good as well.\"\n\nThe march to Sunday's final against Germany has energized people throughout England, with the team's pinpoint passing and flashy goals attracting record crowds, burgeoning TV ratings and adoring coverage. The Lionesses, as the team is known, have been a welcome distraction from the political turmoil and cost-of-living crisis that dominate the headlines.\n\nThe final, set to be played before a sellout crowd of more than 87,000 at historic Wembley Stadium, is seen as a watershed moment for women's sports in England. Although the game, known here as football, is a national passion, female players have often been scoffed at and were once banned from top-level facilities. Now the women's team has a chance to do something the men haven't done since 1966: Win a major international tournament.\n\nDrawing nears for $1.1 billion Mega Millions jackpot\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- A $1.1 billion lottery prize will be on the line Friday night as numbers are drawn for the Mega Millions game.\n\nThe giant jackpot is the nation's third-largest prize and is the result of 29 consecutive drawings without anyone matching all of the game's six numbers. That last time someone hit the Mega Millions jackpot was April 15.\n\nBefore rushing out to spend $2 on a ticket, keep in mind that the odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are a staggering 1 in 302.5 million.\n\nThe $1.1 billion prize is for players who get their winnings through an annuity, paid annually over 29 years. Nearly all winners take the cash option, which for Friday's drawing is an estimated $648.2 million.\n\nIf no one wins the jackpot Friday night, the prize will grow even larger ahead of the next drawing Tuesday night.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

All signs on the ground point to a Ukrainian attack  --  RT Russia & Former Soviet Union", "body": "It was extremely difficult to witness the charred and twisted remains of Ukrainian POWs in the Yelenovka detention center at first hand. The stench of death was overwhelming. Bodies remained in the ruins and melted into the metal bunk beds they were on at the time of the bombing.\n\nOther corpses, presumably killed by shrapnel instead of burning to death, lay outside. A soldier was inspecting them, presumably in order to determine the exact cause, and the victims' identities. Even if the Ukrainian side killed its own soldiers, it was the Russians who took care to identify the remains.\n\nI shared some of the gruesome photos and my thoughts on Twitter immediately after getting back from Yelenovka.\n\nThe next morning, I went around Donetsk to document the extremely dangerous \"petal\" mines Ukraine has dropped on the city. According to DPR Emergency Services, eight civilians had been killed by these mines just the day before. If you step on one of these tiny-but powerful-explosives, chances it will merely tear off a leg instead of outright killing you. And they are insidiously toy-like in appearance, likely to attract children's attention.\n\nUkraine and Western media, as would be expected, blame Russia for the bombing of Yelenovka detention center, which killed 53 people. Russia and the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), in turn, point the finger at Kiev.\n\nIn addition to those killed, the 2am bombing, which DPR officials say was carried out using American-supplied HIMARS, injured at least eight employees and over 70 POWs held there. The prisoners were captured Ukrainian combatants, mainly members of the Azov neo-Nazi militia who'd surrendered in Mariupol in May.\n\nIf HIMARS, or High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System, were indeed the source of the destruction and death, then it is almost certain it was Ukraine who bombed the prison, given that Kiev had the coordinates and is the only side in the conflict that possesses such weapons. Even the Pentagon admits it is possible, albeit characterizing the strike as \"unintentional.\"\n\nFrom a logical perspective, Russia had no motivation to bomb the prison. For Ukraine, on the other hand, these POWs represented a liability, in that they could testify to the alleged war crimes they committed against Donbass civilians.\n\nUkraine has made a litany of claims meant to incriminate Russia throughout the current conflict -the Bucha massacre, the strike on the Mariupol maternity hospital, the Ghost of Kiev hoax, the supposed mass graves of civilians, the outlandish false allegations of Russian soldiers committing sexual crimes, which even saw the former Ukrainian Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights fired by Kiev's own parliament.\n\nRussia has invited the UN and the International Red Cross to investigate the Yelenovka prison bombing. Meanwhile, observers online have used the publicly available data to put together a picture of what occurred. Here's an insightful analysis from the Rybar Telegram channel (with more than 627,000 followers), specializing in military analytics:\n\n\"The eastern part of the building suffered the most damage, where a powerful fire and explosion occurred, which blew out the windows.\" Judging by the angle of impact, the analyst concludes that \"the shooting was carried out from the trajectory of Marinka-Kurakhovo -the Sergeevka triangle- Pokrovsk-Udachnoe.\" This is Ukrainian-controlled territory. The analysis could not conclude whether HIMARS was used, from the information at hand.\n\nAlong the 'who benefits?' line of thinking, a number of circumstances also point to Kiev. These have also been pointed out by Russian observers and compiled into a chronology. The captured Azov Nazis were taken to the Yelenovka detention center in late May. While prisoner exchanges between Ukraine and Russia have included Azov fighters, there is a strong opposition to handing them back over to Kiev, meaning that there's no guarantee that they would be exchanged in the future - potentially making them a liability to Kiev. By June 20 reports of Ukraine shelling the prison already appeared on Russian channels watching the conflict. On July 28 the confession of an Azov member emerged, claiming that neo-Nazis in Kharkov and Kiev had direct orders from Zelensky's office to torture and murder Russian prisoners of war. Late that night/early next morning, Ukraine struck the very detention center holding the Azov member who confessed, as well as others who might have done so.\n\nElsewhere, other neo-Nazis in captivity have confessed to deliberately murdering civilians, a PR disaster for Ukraine, made worse were the prisoners in Yelenovka to follow suit.\n\nLast but not least, just two days before the Yelenovka strike, the US Senate passed a resolution urging the State Department to recognize Russia as a \"sponsor of terrorism.\" By perpetrating an attack and blaming it on Moscow, Kiev could be aiming to push that decision through - even though the State Department is reportedly reluctant.\n\nGiven Ukraine's multiple attempts to incriminate Russia, and eight years of bombing Donbass civilians, killing their own soldiers is not too far-fetched. In fact, surrendered Ukrainian soldiers have claimed their commanders threatened to shoot them if they attempted desertion, and indeed Ukrainian nationalists firing on them when they attempted to surrender, in one case killing or wounding dozens .\n\nIt is left to Russian and DPR doctors to preserve the lives of Ukrainian POWs - even those apparently injured by friendly fire. Outside a Donetsk hospital after the Yelenovka bombing, one of the doctors working on wounded Ukrainians said that five had already had successful surgery for their shrapnel wounds, and two more were to undergo operations.\n\n\"It doesn't matter which side you're on, we will help you,\" he said.\n\nThe ghastly scenes of charred flesh and shrapnel-studded bodies I saw at the prison will remain etched in my mind for a long time.

Meanwhile, the killing of captured Azov prisoners by the Russian forces has escalated tensions, serious changes have taken place on the political scene, and internal political conflicts in Ukraine are gaining international attention.\n\nThe military situation\n\nBehind the scenes of a lull in fighting, both sides are struggling for a major strategic gain that will shape the next stage of the war.\n\nThe enemy continues to attack Ukrainian troops in the Donetsk region whilst preparing for further assaults on the district of Sloviansk. The occupiers are also strengthening positions on the right bank of the Dnipro in the Kherson region, having amassed as many as 25,000 military personnel.\n\nFor their part, the UAF are concentrating their power in the south of the country. They have successfully destroyed the Antonivskyi road and rail bridges over the Dnipro river, isolating Russian forces from other occupied areas and regaining ground.\n\nAs a result, the enemy has been left with a limited supply of ammunition, fuel and the ability to replenish military equipment. Most Russian supply warehouses in the area have been (or will be) destroyed by HIMARS.\n\nAttempts by the occupiers to establish pontoon crossings across the Dnipro have so far proved fruitless. Delivery of the necessary weapons and ammunition to the Russians by airplanes is unlikely to be effective. Ukraine's troops have a strong supply of air defense equipment on the battlefield and the occupiers have a limited number of transport planes.\n\nSooner or later, the Russians will experience \"shell hunger\" and a lack of other supplies. They will be faced with a choice: passively suffer under the constant fire of the Ukrainian army, or go on a fruitless attack. Alternatively, they could try to evacuate to the left bank of the Dnipro, abandoning heavy equipment, or simply surrender. The latter would clearly be the preferred option.\n\nBy the end of the summer, the main focus of military operations is expected to be in the Kherson region, where the Ukrainian army is already creating a strong advantage.\n\nThe success of Ukraine's forces in Kherson will pose a threat to the entire enemy group in the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region to the east and near Mariupol in the south-east.\n\nAssassination of captured \"Azov\" soldiers\n\nThe murder of children, destruction of cities, constant rocket attacks and what looks like genocide in and around Bucha - Russian war crimes are becoming too numerous to count and last week were supplemented by another violation.\n\nOn July 29, members of the \"Wagner\" group are believed to have killed around 50 captured men from Ukraine's \"Azov\" regiment, with a further 70 Ukrainian soldiers wounded. According to insider information, the direct order to liquidate the Ukrainian military was given by the boss of the company, Yevgeny Prigozhin, one of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin's butchers.\n\nHaving organized explosions in the barracks where they kept the prisoners, the enemy blamed this on the UAF, purporting that they destroyed their own captured people with HIMARS.\n\nLet us not analyze in detail the absurdity of \"rashist\" lies. Instead, let us focus instead on the consequences of this crime.\n\nFirstly, there is the risk of escalation. Ukraine is a party to international conventions on prisoners of war. But it will be difficult for our defenders to explain why they should safeguard the lives of captured occupiers after the mass murder of the \"Azov\" soldiers. It is impossible to ignore the dead mutilated bodies and screams of pain from one of the Ukrainian prisoners who was castrated and then killed by the Russians.\n\nAndrii Biletskyi, the first commander of \"Azov\" announced the hunt for all participants in this heinous crime. The Commander-in-Chief of the UAF, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, is convinced that all guilty parties will be punished.\n\nThe only argument that can deter our defenders is that the more Russian prisoners we have, the more we can exchange them for our soldiers.\n\nThe war is becoming more brutal and it seems that there are no red lines that the rashists will not cross. Punishment for those crimes must be inescapable.\n\nChanges on the political scene\n\nDomestic political processes in Ukraine almost ground to a halt when Russia launched its full-scale invasion. A form of non-aggression pact was put in place, although this has been violated from time to time by the authorities and opposition parties.\n\nMost of these activities took place behind the scenes of the political stage. However, in mid-July there was a public \"explosion\" - the head of the State Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) Ihor Bakanov, and Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova, were dismissed.\n\nDespite their being close to President Zelensky, the claims against them were serious: that they did not fight hard enough against Russian aggression by root outing enemies within their units. These claims are important because during the time of independence, hundreds of Russian spies infiltrated the SBU, especially when it was headed by a Russian citizen, Oleksandr Yakymenko.\n\nIt is worth noting that there were no prior direct complaints made against these high-ranking officials. Instead, the matter lies more in the banal struggle for power. After an informational attack against the Head of the Presidential Administration Andrii Yermak, there appears to have been retaliation and the two prominent officials were removed from their positions.\n\nAndrii Kostin, who is close to Yermak, was appointed to the position of Prosecutor General. In this way, Yermak is seen to strengthen his influence not only personally on the country's leader, but on the entire hierarchy of power.\n\nIt seems that Venediktova's problems have gone away at least for now, with no official investigation having been scheduled and some political powers wanting to appoint the former Prosecutor General as ambassador of Ukraine to Switzerland. Meanwhile, Ihor Bakanov has disappeared from public view.\n\nIn a time of war, it is more important than ever that key officials remain above suspicion. The president must understand that responsibility for Yermak's actions must be borne personally by the head of state. Where there is even the slightest doubt, Zelensky must act and dismiss.\n\nThe firing of Ruslan Demchenko, who was accused of working for Russian intelligence, remains a separate story. The deputy secretary of the National Security Council and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee seemingly became too \"toxic\" and began to negatively affect the image of the president, and hence was sacrificed.\n\nSuch perturbations, motivated at least in part by personal interest, do not help Ukraine's current situation in a time of war. Government efficiency has already slowed and any political rumblings will undoubtedly be scrutinized by our Western partners who are watching closely.\n\nThe only positive point in this story is the appointment of Oleksandr Klymenko as head of the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office. Thus, one of Ukraine's homework tasks for becoming closer to the goal of being a European Union member has been completed.\n\nIhor Zhdanov is a co-founder of the Open Policy Foundation, a National Government Organization (NGO) in Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.kyivpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/000_32fn7bn-1.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 20, "stanza_neu": 34, "stanza_pos": 5, "swn_neg": 59, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7133405681", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-30", "time": "07:30:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-30T07:30:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-30T07:25:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4196078479290009, "url": "https://censor.net/en/news/3357463/russians_destroyed_or_damaged_more_than_100000_houses_in_which_35_million_ukrainians_lived_kyslytsia", "title": "Russians destroyed or damaged more than 100,000 houses in which 3.5 million Ukrainians lived, - Kyslytsia", "body": "Permanent Representative of Ukraine to the UN, Serhiy Kyslytsia, spoke about Russia's war crimes.\n\nAs reported by Censor.NET with reference to RBC-Ukraine.\n\nHe spoke about the latest Russian atrocities committed on the territory of Ukraine - about the torture and killing of prisoners and the blowing up of the penitentiary in the occupied Olenivka, the Donetsk region, where prisoners of war were kept.\n\nAccording to him, the Russian occupiers aimed to hide the torture and execution of prisoners they carried out there.\n\nKyslytsia also recalled the rocket attacks on the port of Odesa, which occurred immediately after the signing of the grain agreement in Istanbul, a residential building and two sanatoriums in the Odesa region, a five-story building in Chasovyy Yar, the center of the city of Vinnytsia, about the recent bombing of civilian objects in Kropyvnytskyi, in Kyiv and the Chernihiv regions, about the daily shelling of Kharkiv and Mykolaiv.\n\n\"It is outrageous that Russia is still trying to spread fakes instead of fulfilling its obligations.

Today, 4 years later, they were also right with this forecast. What do you say about the current events, that Russia started a war in Ukraine and then attacked all of Europe.\n\nRalf Dodt: Are you kidding me with this question? Short answer, Russia didn't start a war against Ukraine, point, end of discussion. I am not having conversations with someone who is doing exactly what the main stream media around the world is doing, spreading lies. If you have a preconceived notion, why do you want an interview with me? If you are afraid of losing your job for telling the truth, you should not work as a journalist and find another job.\n\nTo be honest, I hate to say anything about the situation with Russia. Unfortunately, most people in western countries are so stupid and politically illiterate that they just blindly believe the western main stream media. These people do not understand that these media are \"bought\" and only publish what the government specifies. Unfortunately, only a very small part of the population has understood that they are being fooled and fed with lies by the government.\n\nI apologize for the incorrectly worded question. What do you say about the current events affecting Russia and Ukraine?\n\nRalf Dodt: First of all, Russia is not waging a war against Ukraine but is conducting a geographically limited military operation in Ukraine, that's a difference. If Russia were to wage a war against Ukraine in Ukraine, Ukraine would no longer exist and the Russian army would be standing on the border with Slovakia.\n\nBut that is again typical for the western countries, lies upon lies. The fact is, they alone are inciting Ukraine into a real war against Russia. Russia is still conducting its military operation, but that doesn't mean that the situation can't suddenly change drastically if the West continues to deal with Russia as it has been up to now.\n\nThe West is not concerned with defeating Russia in a war, the West is only concerned with destroying Russia completely, the West, above all the American, German and French governments, have made it their mission! Russia has never had any interest in attacking the West and has no interest now.\n\nWhy is Russia suddenly behaving so aggressively towards the West?\n\nRalf Dodt: Russia is behaving aggressively towards the West? Where and when did Russia ever do that? Just a few days ago, for example, Germany was offered gas from Russia via Nord Stream 2, who once again didn't want it was Germany.\n\nNow to the alleged aggressiveness of Russia. This is what the West likes to say and proclaims in all tones around the world. But there is only one form of aggressiveness here, and it has been celebrated in the West for years. But if the West has provoked, threatened and lied to you again and again for decades, and if the borders are being pushed further and further towards Russia by the \"Noth Atlantic Terror Organization\" - NATO, what else should President Putin do than ensure that, at least stop the attacks on helpless people in eastern Ukraine ?\n\nFor years, the people there have been tortured, shot at and shot by the corrupt rulers in Kyiv. In the 8 years since 2014, the Ukrainian Nazis have tortured and killed more than 14,000 people. Furthermore, President Putin ensured that the bio laboratories financed by the USA and Germany were also destroyed. These were a danger to Russia and the Russian people.\n\nEven NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg publicly admitted just a few days ago that NATO has been providing military support to the Ukrainian armed forces since 2014 by training and equipping them. This support will therefore be further expanded. They also agreed on a comprehensive aid package that, according to Stoltenberg, \"can help Ukraine switch from Soviet equipment to more modern NATO standard equipment.\" It was also agreed that \"to protect all allies\" the defense capacities in all areas - air, sea, land and cyberspace - should be significantly expanded... and then Russia shouldn't feel threatened all these years?\n\nIn fact, it is Ukraine that is waging a war against Russia, sponsored and supported by the West. I have enough footage of it for you to watch. Footage of statements by Ukrainian Ultranationalists proving that Russia is not waging or has not started a war against Ukraine.\n\nWhat do you say to the Western reporting that there would be no Nazis or terror regimes in Ukraine?\n\nRalf Dodt: The West publishes news that Russians are killing civilians and that there are no Nazi's in Ukraine. The West, especially the German government, is lying over and over again by saying that the Ukrainian government doesn't shoot on civilians. That's such dirty lie that I want puke.\n\nYevhen Karas, for example, is a well-known Ukrainian ultra-nationalist and he proudly says in front of the camera that Ukraine \"finally started the biggest war against Russia in many years\". In doing so, he contradicts the German government in particular. So how can it be that the West keeps claiming that there are no Nazis in Ukraine, but the Nazis themselves say in front of the camera that they do exist!?\n\nEven the press secretary of the 112th Territorial Defense Brigade of Ukraine Andrei Kovalyov has called the law, drafted in 1941 by Nazi collaborators, one of the foundations of modern Ukrainian statehood. One of the foundations of Ukrainian statehood is the law developed by Ukrainian Nazi collaborators in 1941. This was announced by Andrei Kovalyov, press secretary of the 112th Territorial Defense Brigade of Ukraine, on the occasion of the Day of Ukrainian Statehood. Kovalyov underlined that he supports the holiday.\n\nHere a other proof for those dirty lies. The german Public television ARD admitted already in 2014 that Ukraine is killing civilians in Donbass and called for crackdowns on the Ukrainian regime:\n\n.......\"The Ukrainian military also terrorizes the civilian population. They carry the war into living rooms and bedrooms with artillery fire and pay little attention to the plight of the people and apparently even less to their lives. Europe cannot and must not tolerate this. That's why we need a clear message to those in power in Kyiv now. The terror against the civilian population must end, and the artillery shelling of residential areas must be stopped immediately. If not, Europe is complicit. Then the civilians killed in the urban fighting in Donetsk or Lugansk are also our dead.\".........\n\nWestern politicians lie, they lie to the people to get elected, then they lie to the people to spread fear and terror and to achieve their own goals from this, and then to blame everything that happens on Russia! The Western mendacious (German) politicians, however, do not tell the truth. If they told the people the absolute truth, that they want the people to starve and freeze to death just for their own benefit and advantage, then some governments would end up like Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu did in December 1989.\n\nThe world should know what is really going on in Ukraine and how the so-called government in Kyiv is governing. The West is only interested in destroying Russia and killing the population. How would you react if your neighbor tells you that he wants to kill a third of your family? You don't think anyone would say that? Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, (again a Nobel Peace Prize winner) said on July 11, 20022 that the best thing would be to kill at least 50 million Russians and dismember the country so that Russia is no longer the country it is now. What kind of antisocial behavior is this? Has a politician in Russia ever said something like that to another people? No !\n\nThe West's attitude towards President Putin does not correspond at all to political norms. Putin will react to this disrespectful attitude towards him in the same way.\n\nHate speech against President Putin worldwide and calls to kill him once again show the actual ugly face of Western mendacity. The German government in particular allows and encourages it if you are publicly against Russians, but if you say something publicly against the insane corona measures you will be persecuted. Did you know that in Germany there are shops whose doors say ..... \"Dogs and Russians must stay outside\"!? Is that still politics or rather pure stupidity of those who promote it and those who like to do it?\n\nWhat kind of world do we live in now, where so-called politicians publicly demand the death of a president instead of pursuing proper politics. If someone on the streets asks someone else to kill a person, that's a serious crime, but politicians can do that with impunity? Who gives them the right to do this?\n\nDo these idiots also think about the fact that such demands will also have consequences for themselves? All the sick politicians who are now screaming that they want Putin's assassination to consider the fact that they and their families will then be on a hit list from which they don't even know about! Money rules the world and there is plenty of money outside of Russia defending Russia's interests.\n\nVery serious riots can take place in Lithuania, Holland, Germany or wherever if the West turns to terrorism against Russia rather than try politics. The West has done this often enough with so-called NGOs in other countries, and it is then done in Western Europe in exactly the same way. Then no one will feel safe anymore. A regime change can be forced in any country...... It's time for real politicians before all will escalade because of current stupid actions of stupid politicians. Russians politicians have tried it decades but the West politicians became more stupid.\n\nLet's take a few other facts that the West likes to keep secret when it comes to Ukraine. In a special report from 2021, the European Court of Auditors attested to gross corruption and the hijacking of the state by private interests in Ukraine. Corruption at all levels hinders competition, growth and democratization. Tens of billions of euros are lost every year, money from taxpayers in the euro zone.\n\nUkraine lags even behind Albania, one of the poorest countries in Europe. The Ukraine policy has failed, as has its Russia, its migration and its economic policy. The only thing they can think of in all their shipwrecks is to import other countries' problems into the EU. Your crisis policy is just a pretext to get the Europeans used to an ever lower standard of living. Ukraine is not fighting for democracy, Ukraine is a thoroughly corrupt country.\n\nThe Ukraine (politician) creates nothing except collect money and pose as a victim everywhere. They are losers and always will be. First they start a war and then they yell loudly that they need weapons, then they demand that the West do everything against Russia. Did any EU country want war against Ukraine? But the citizens should save on gas for it? I wonder who governs the EU.. Ukraine? The most corrupt country in Europe?\n\nYou said that any government that supports Ukraine supports international terrorism and risks the security of its own people and country, what do you mean by saying so?\n\nRalf Dodt: It is meant exactly as I said it. Every country that supports Ukraine, especially with weapons or money, actively helps to keep the war from ending. The longer this war lasts, the more weapons are sold to the West on the black market and are reliably delivered.\n\nApart from the fact that the Ukrainian army in East Ukraine even murders children and puts them on death lists, one should not deny the fact that at least more than 250 Javelin (and other manufacturer) rocket launchers have already been transported to Germany and other EU countries. More than 4,000 Makarov pistols, Saiga-12 shotguns etc. are already in Germany as well. Every day more weapons are delivered to Germany, Holland, France, Romania, etc. and the governments are doing nothing?\n\nNow let's add another really deadly fact. So-called refugees work in almost all European airports. They were hired without any real security clearance. The fact is, however, that IS supporters work in the security areas of various airports! Now let's just add an IS supporter and a Javlin rocket launcher, the result is that international terrorism can safely get Western weapons and shoot down fully occupied planes with them.\n\nWhere is the Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany Bundeskriminalamt) or EUROPOL in this case? Does anyone want to tell me that the Federal Criminal Police Office does not know that weapons are being brought daily from Ukraine by Ukrainian refugees to Germany and other EU countries? I can not believe that.\n\nAs we know from the special report of the European Court of Auditors from 2021, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe but also the poorest. How is it then that e.g. expensive cars with Ukrainian license plates like Lexus - BE1314CH, Mercedes - BE6705EI, BMW - BE0822BK, Range Rover - AI2990OB, Porsche Cayenne - KA9777TT and many more were on the places in Ukraine where you can buy guns and then drove to Germany via Poland, with the guns ?! So even the best European police don't know anything about it?\n\nDoes anyone want to tell me that nobody knows that a large part of the so-called Ukrainian refugees are the transporters for these weapons?\n\nDoes anyone want to tell me that nobody knows that thousands of weapons have been deposited at certain deposits on the EU border since March 2022 and are being delivered on order by Ukrainian gangs?\n\nDoes anyone want to tell me that nobody knows that minimum 4,000 Kalashnikov's are already in the EU splittet in different countries?\n\nDoes anyone want to tell me that nobody knows that a Saiga12 for instance cost 700\u20ac but if you take 5pcs you get already a discount?\n\nDoes anyone want to tell me that nobody knows that anyone can buy even used tanks in Ukraine?\n\nIsn't there some way to stop this illegal arms trade from Ukraine?\n\nRalf Dodt: Nothing can be done about it now, it's too late, the German government has opened the gates of hell and all of Europe, if not the whole world, will have to suffer as a result. The weapons that are already in the EU have already disappeared into dark channels. The German government is responsible for every innocent person who may die from these illegal weapons from Ukraine. Let's be honest, who should be interested in such weapons other than criminals and terrorists?\n\nAnyway, the police don't see it, don't know it or don't want to see it or know it. The fact is, however, an IS supporter can cause considerable damage with a rocket launcher and kill many people. So now these weapons from the Ukraine are traveling around the world and anyone who wants something like this can get it delivered, provided they have the money for it. This means that international terrorism will find its way worldwide.\n\nThe West finances these criminals with its behavior. These are people who literally sucked all the juice out of Ukraine. And today it is not they who pay for it, but the citizens of Ukraine and all European countries. They consistently funded each of the regimes in Ukraine without looking back at the moral component and the economic problems that this leap from changing governments and parties brought to the country.\n\nThese are people who traded money for the right to do as they please, largely ignoring human hardship, economic decline and rising social tensions. They fund illegal armed groups and nationalists. Eventually, the Ukrainian criminals played too hard, lost touch with reality and eventually led Ukraine into war. They think they could get away with anything.\n\nAnd I have a question for European politicians: why do they keep getting away with it? Is it because Ukrainian criminals solve their problems the way they are used to - with bribes?\n\nThe idea that weapons have been sold illegally in Ukraine for months and then possibly end up in the hands of terrorists is frightening. That means that every passenger plane is a potential victim.\n\nRalf Dodt: Yes, every flight worldwide can be a potential tragedy and the risk is increasing every day. But that's not all. Germany in particular is currently concerned that there could be massive unrest in the coming autumn / winter because people are said to be freezing, allegedly due to a lack of Russian gas and there is a risk of a blackout. Then Germany and every other country would sink into chaos and anarchy within 3 days. If the incompetent German government is so worried, why isn't it stopping this pseudo-refugee trek from Ukraine? Why don't they at least go and check the cars intensively for weapons? Nothing is done, just big words that everything is under control.\n\nNothing, absolutely nothing, is under the German government's control. There are already too many illegal weapons in private hands plus the criminals who have already stocked up plus the weapons for the IS supporters. Do these political losers still want to have all this under control? What are the police going to do if something like this happens? Even the German army cannot help in case of a blackout, no electricity, no gas, no petrol, no money, no light, not even water will come out of the tap. But then there are those running around outside who have received cheap weapons from the Ukraine. That can and will happen in every country, that's what I call supporting international terrorism.\n\nIn addition, the West should be aware that not only the illegal weapons from Ukraine are a major problem for the world, but also the fact that there are enormous forces inside and outside the EU and the USA that are on the side of Russia . This is about billions of dollars that will be used when the time comes. This could very quickly result in a world war, but Europe will not win it.\n\nThe West, especially Germany, is always demanding that Russia end the war. How stupid is the German government to ask for something like that while they keep supplying weapons to Ukraine? If you really want to end a war, you don't supply arms to one of the most corrupt countries in the world. The West and its dictatorial behavior towards other countries will eventually lead to real war.\n\nIf someone doesn't want to be their slave, they want to destroy them.\n\nIf they can't control or own something, they want to destroy it.\n\nIf someone has a life of their own independent of them, they want to destroy them.\n\nWhen someone doesn't do what they expect, they want to destroy them.\n\nWithout any discussion, the German government are warmongers, if the house is on fire from the roof to the basement, you get water and use it to put out the fire. Germany is extinguishing this house with oil... I don't think there is much more to say about that\n\nThere is a point of no return. Once that point is passed, there will be no turning back and Europe will perish. The Western world, especially Western Europe, is finished. President Putin knows that Western unity has an expiry date\". \"Russia will not be kind to those enemies who decide to join their enemies. They have the ability to put everyone in their place when all the red lines are crossed.\"\n\nDo you think the situation will deteriorate drastically and there will be a big war between Russia and the West?\n\nRalf Dodt: Yes, there is a real danger, and that is because the West was and is not prepared to even negotiate the only important issue for Russia and for President Putin, namely the question of Ukraine's membership in NATO. President Biden has declined to negotiate. Putin asked for it, and in the end it came out that Biden said that instead of negotiating this issue, we will introduce sanctions, tough sanctions. And afterwards he said I knew that these sanctions would not prevent the war. He explicitly said so.\"\n\nA US senator also demanded: \"Someone in Russia\" must now take action \"and eliminate this guy\". So President Putin should be assassinated.\n\nWho have been the warmongers in recent years? Who put Russia in a corner like a plague sick leper? Who is throwing Europe into a serious crisis?\n\n\"The West's policy of confrontation so far hasn't provided the security that Vladimir Putin wanted. Instead of constantly demonizing Putin, couldn't we just start with a normal human experience? It's only through dialogue that one can see what the other wants and what they want where joint progress is possible.\"\n\nThe world has a level-headed Russian president like Putin to thank for the fact that nuclear World War III has not yet happened.\n\nWhat is your prognosis if things continue as they are now?\n\n\u25ab\ufe0f As soon as President Putin has finished his work in Seversk, Bakhmut and Soledar, having reached the second line Slavyansk-Kramatorsk-Avdeyevka, he will make a proposal to the West. And if they [the West] don't accept it - and they won't - then all hell will break loose.\"\n\n\u25ab\ufe0f Sanctions are not deadly for Russia;\n\nRussia will survive as a \"fortress\" like a vast, isolated \"North Korea\" only with many more options than North Korea (India, China etc.)\n\n\u25ab\ufe0f An exit from the world economy is possible and even desirable. The West itself is in decline. His impending death is inevitable.\n\n\u25ab\ufe0f There will be a historically unique confrontation, many people will die, economic crash of the West is inevitable\n\n\u25ab\ufe0f Things are getting rough in Europe, there is a radical upheaval, in the end one expects the \"emergence of a fundamentally new order in Europe\"\n\n\"Editor's note: We have checked the footage and unfortunately have to admit that Western weapons are indeed for sale in many cities in Ukraine. These sales take place in side streets. What is really worrying is the fact that, among other things, the Javelin Medium Antiarmor Weapon System rocket launcher is also available for purchase. Furthermore, crates of ammunition and handguns are offered such as crates of Makarov pistols, Saiga-12 shotguns in a wide range of configurations. You can buy any weapon there, even american Colts. If you use the TOR browser, you can even find pages on the Darknet where weapons are explicitly offered in Ukraine by partisan groups fighting against Russia and making money this way.\n\nFurther more the Statement of Ralf Dodt is now even reported by the journalist Steffen Schwarzkopf, who reports live from the Donbass for \"Welt\" on the war damage and the military situation. In particular, he points out that the Ukrainian military deliberately positions its defense systems in the middle of residential areas and near schools and hospitals.

What happened in Olenivka Prison", "body": "New Katyn massacre -- this is how the tragedy in the correctional colony No. 120, located near the village of Olenivka in the territory temporarily occupied by Russia, can go down in the history of war. On July 29, Russian propaganda reported on dozens of dead and wounded Ukrainians held here by the occupiers. According to the Russian version, the Ukrainian Armed Forces hit the colony, however, this version does not stand up to any criticism. The Ukrainian side says that this is nothing more than the execution of prisoners of war by Russia and demands an investigation and punishment.\n\nThe destroyed barracks in the correctional colony in Olenivka, July 29, 2022 / Photo: AP Photo\n\nWhat happened -- Russian propaganda version\n\nOn the morning of July 29, Russian propaganda spread information that more than 50 people were killed and more than 70 were injured due to the shelling of the colony in Olenivka. All of them are detained Ukrainians. This happened allegedly as a result of two direct hits on the building where more than 150 prisoners of war, mostly members of the Azov Regiment, were detained. According to the occupiers, in this way, Ukraine wanted to get rid of Azov Regiment members who allegedly began to testify about the criminal orders of the leadership.\n\nAt the same time, not a single colony employee was injured.\n\nVideo footage of Russian television does not allow to see confirmation of the voiced version. Propagandists show alleged debris from US-suppled HIMARS missiles but do not show the craters that should have formed after the attack. The video also does not show the general plans of the building on which rockets were allegedly targeted from the Ukrainian side.\n\nThe destroyed barracks in the correctional colony in Olenivka, July 29, 2022 / Photo: AP Photo\n\nWhat happened -- human rights defenders' version\n\nCorrectional colony No. 120 is located 2 km from the urban-type settlement of Olenivka, closer to the village of Molodizhne.\n\nYou can see from Google Maps that the colony's territory is 450 by 270 meters. In the lower-left corner, you can see 6 barracks, in the upper part -- the so-called \"industrial zone.\" Members of the Azov Regiment, service members of the 36th Marine Brigade, and border guards from Mariupol, as well as civilians who did not pass the \"filtration\" process, are detained on the territory of the prison.\n\nAccording to the Media Initiative for Human Rights coordinator, Olha Reshetylova, in total, more than a thousand people were detained in the colony. It's more than the plan allows - the colony is overcrowded.\n\nHuman rights defenders from MIPL communicated with those held in this colony and locals. They said that there could be about 200 people in the building. The same sources told human rights activists another version of what happened in the colony on the night of July 29. According to this information, there was no shelling - there was an explosion since the sound typical for shelling was not heard. Moreover, this happened not in those barracks where prisoners were kept for a long time but in another one, where the Ukrainians were only recently moved.\n\n\"If the information that we have is proven: that the Russians specially brought people there, organized this explosion - there were 3 or 4 explosions - then this is one of the most brutal crimes,\" said Reshetylova in a conversation with hromadske.\n\nShe draws attention to the strange report that during the so-called \"shelling,\" none of the guards were injured.\n\n\"According to the released hostages and prisoners, we know that they are under the constant supervision of convoy, Russian soldiers, or representatives of the so-called people's militia of \"DPR.\" I have not heard of cases where they were left without the supervision of the colony staff. So it seems strange that none of the guards were injured,\" Reshetylova adds.\n\nUkrainian service members in Olenivka colony after leaving Azovstal, May 19, 2022 / Photo: AP Photo\n\nWhat happened - official versions of Ukraine\n\nOn July 29, several Ukrainian agencies immediately voiced versions of what happened in the colony.\n\nThe General Staff was one of the first to announce the information: missile forces and artillery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine did not attack Olenivka. Instead, Russia's Armed Forces carried out a targeted and deliberate artillery attack on the colony.\n\nLater, the Security Service of Ukraine reported that the \"shelling\" of the Olenivka colony was carried out by the occupiers - the Russians allegedly planted explosives in the colony. In confirmation of this, the Special Service of Ukraine published an audio recording, which was called an interception of the militants' conversation.\n\nIn this recording, an unknown \"DPR\" militant tells the interlocutor that two days before the tragedy, about 200 people were moved to the \"industrial zone\" to a new barracks, and after that, they (the Russians -- ed.) blew up the barracks.\n\n\"Yesterday night (July 28 -- ed.), around 11 p.m., Grad started working just under the fence, 100 meters from the fence. The first 10 rockets were followed by an explosion. The second 10 -- explosion. A total of three explosions,\" the audio recording says.\n\nThe conversation also mentioned that no shells were heard, and windows in nearby buildings were not blown out. The Security Service of Ukraine also draws attention to this (surviving windows on the video of Russian propagandists) in its message.\n\n\"This indicates that the epicenter of the explosion was inside the destroyed building, and its walls \"silenced\" the blast waves and \"protected\" the neighboring premises,\" the Special Service concludes.\n\nAfter the SSU, the Defence Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported on the situation in the colony. Intelligence mentions a \"powerful explosion\" that destroyed the premises where the captured Ukrainians were detained. Further, the message refers to explosions on the territory of the industrial zone in a newly built building, which was supposed to be specially equipped to hold prisoners taken out of Azovstal. According to intelligence, the construction of this building was completed two days ago, after which some of the detained Ukrainians were transferred there.\n\nDefence Intelligence emphasizes that the death of Ukrainians is a provocation and an act of terrorism committed by mercenaries of the private Russian paramilitary organization Wagner Group on the personal instructions of the nominal owner, Yevgeny Prigozhin. The latter is also known as \"Putin's cook.\" At the same time, as the Defence Intelligence notes, the Russian Ministry of Defense was not involved in these plans.\n\nWhy were Ukrainians killed?\n\nThe Ukrainian side voiced several versions of why exactly the Russians could resort to a terrorist attack.\n\nIn particular, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine says that the occupiers intended to accuse Ukraine of committing \"war crimes\" and to cover up the executions and torture of prisoners.\n\nDefence Intelligence calls the main purpose of the terrorist attack the desire to hide the facts of embezzlement of funds allocated for the maintenance of Ukrainian prisoners of war -- allegedly, on August 1, the Moscow commission was supposed to visit the colony to check expenses.\n\nAnother goal, according to Ukrainian intelligence, is to increase social tension in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to Oksana Moroz, the founder of the information hygiene initiative \"How not to become a vegetable,\" the tragedy in the colony became another stage of a large-scale Psychological operation (PSYOP). According to her observations, after the terrorist attack in Vinnytsia, the Russians in the information field began to intimidate Ukrainians to incline them into the negotiation process, this is \"forcing to peace.\"\n\n\"This is an ordinary terrorist PSYOP, absolutely the same technique. For terrorists, the number of victims is not important, the main thing is the media effect. And the media effect is intimidation. That's where they hit,\" says Moroz in a conversation with hromadske.\n\nIs this PSYOP achieving its goals? Moroz divides the answer into two parts.\n\nIf we talk about \"forcing to peace,\" then the Russians are not successful here. \"This does not affect either the position of the authorities or Ukrainians. Ukrainians write that we will not surrender. I haven't seen posts saying that we are ready to stop fighting and make compromises,\" Moroz shares her observations of the reaction to terrorist attacks on social networks.\n\nInstead, PSYOP can achieve another goal -- unbalancing society. \"In this regard, such a PSYOP is effective. This is evidenced by what people write on social networks. People are affected emotionally now. Someone falls into an emotional state of despondency and depression,\" explains Moroz.\n\nAt the same time, the expert adds that after the death of the prisoners in the colony in Olenivka, she observes a shake-up of the situation regarding Azov and Zelensky on social networks. \"They are starting to ask the question: why don't you save Azov?\" The Russians can use this situation for another attempt to divide, to strike at the authorities,\" concludes Moroz.\n\nInspection of the bodies of captured Ukrainian service members in the colony in Olenivka, July 29, 2022 / Photo: AP Photo\n\nWill the Russians face punishment for Olenivka?\n\nRussia should bear the punishment for the death of Ukrainians in the colony, says human rights activist Olha Reshetylova in conversation with hromadske. This follows from the Hague Convention of 1907: prisoners of war are under the authority of the opposing side's government, not of the individuals or units that captured them.\n\n\"This is the responsibility of the party under whose jurisdiction the prisoners of war are, they are responsible for their safety. What can be the punishment? This is a violation of international humanitarian law. There will be an investigation, and given the circumstances, it will be proven whether this is a war crime or just a violation of international humanitarian law,\" says Reshetylova.\n\nIf Russia's crime in Olenivka is confirmed in the eyes of the world community, it may accelerate the recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian law enforcement agencies have opened proceedings under Article 438 of the Criminal Code \"Violation of the laws and customs of war.\" According to the interim Head of the Security Service of Ukraine, Vasyl Maliuk, the available evidence indicates that Russia is responsible for the murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war.\n\nMeanwhile, the founder of the Azov Regiment, Andrii Biletsky, announced a hunt for everyone involved in the mass murder in Olenivka and promised that every rank-and-file performer and every organizer would be held accountable, regardless of position and location. \"Wherever you hide, you will be found and exterminated,\" Biletsky said.\n\nThe Russian forces keep the colony in Olenivka closed to the whole world. Because of this, it is impossible to verify any information regarding the events in the colony. Now, there is no reliable information on the number of dead and wounded, it is not known whether they were only members of the Azov Regiment or other prisoners who were also kept in the colony. Different versions from Ukrainian structures, which were voiced during the day, can be explained by the lack of access to the territory and references to various sources, the information from which cannot always be verified.", "source": {"uri": "en.hromadske.ua", "dataType": "news", "title": "en.hromadske.ua"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/hromadske-en/posts/images/000/004/024/original/data?1659192023", "eventUri": "eng-7903716", "sentiment": -0.6549019607843137, "wgt": 101, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 33, "stanza_neu": 61, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 96, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7132477239", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-07-29", "time": "11:32:00", "dateTime": "2022-07-29T11:32:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-07-29T11:32:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.3960784375667572, "url": "https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2022/07/29/7360828/", "title": "Russians announce 53 Ukrainian prisoners dead - Ukrainian MoD Intelligence says Russia is responsible", "body": "On the morning of 29 July, Russian-aligned propaganda media announced the shelling of a penal colony in Olenivka, Donetsk Oblast, where Ukrainian prisoners are being held.
