China's representative was scheduled to speak Tuesday.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said North Korea is preparing to conduct its seventh nuclear test, Iran \"has either been unwilling or unable\" to accept a deal to return to the 2015 nuclear agreement aimed at reining in its nuclear program, and Russia is \"engaged in reckless, dangerous nuclear saber-rattling\" in Ukraine.\n\nHe cited Russian President Vladimir Putin's warning after its Feb. 24 invasion that any attempt to interfere would lead to \"consequences you have never seen,\" emphasizing that his country is \"one of the most potent nuclear powers.\"\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said divisions in the world since the last review conference in 2015, which ended without a consensus document, have become greater, adding that Russia's threat to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war has contributed \"to worldwide concern that yet another catastrophe by nuclear weapon use is a real possibility.\"\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Moscow's \"reckless nuclear rhetoric\" since its invasion of its smaller neighbor \"is putting at risk everything the NPT has achieved

highly radioactive waste in storage.\" He said this brings the notion of having \"a human shield to an entirely different and horrific level.\"\n\nRussia's delegation to the NPT issued a statement

taking place \"at a time of nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War.\"\n\nThe conference is \"an opportunity to hammer out the measures that will help avoid certain disaster, and to put humanity on a new path towards a world free of nuclear weapons,\" he said.\n\nBut Guterres warned that \"geopolitical weapons are reaching new highs,\" almost 13,000 nuclear weapons are in arsenals around the world, and countries seeking \"false security\" are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on \"doomsday weapons.\"\n\n\"All this at a time when the risks of proliferation are growing and guardrails to prevent escalation are weakening,\" he said, \"And when crises -- with nuclear undertones -- are festering from the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and to many other factors around the world.\"\n\nGuterres called on conference participants to take several actions: urgently reinforce and reaffirm \"the 77-year-old norm against the use of nuclear weapons,\" work relentlessly toward eliminating nuclear weapons with new commitments to reduce arsenals, address \"the simmering tensions in the Middle Est and Asia\" and promote the peaceful use of nuclear technology.\n\n\"Future generations are counting on your commitment to step back from the abyss,\" he implored the ministers and diplomats. \"This is our moment to meet

Gutteres added that people had been extraordinarily lucky so far, \"but luck is not a strategy. Nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict.\"\n\nGuterres was addressing world leaders belonging to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) at a conference when he called on nations to \"put humanity on a new path toward a world free of nuclear weapons.\"\n\nHe also outlined five areas for action, beginning with reinforcing and reaffirming the norm against the use of nuclear weapons, which requires commitment from all parties to the treaty.\n\n\"We need to strengthen all avenues of dialogue and transparency.?Peace cannot take hold in an absence of trust and mutual respect,\" Guterres said.\n\nThe meeting, which was held at the UN's headquarters in New York, has been postponed several times since 2020 due to the pandemic. It has since resumed and will run until August 26.\n\nGuterres said the conference was a chance to strengthen the treaty and \"make it fit for the worrying world around us,\" citing the Russia-Ukraine war as well as the tensions on the Korean Peninsula and in the Middle East.\n\nHe also said eliminating nuclear weapons is the only guarantee that they will never be used, adding that he would visit Hiroshima for the anniversary of its August 6, 1945 bombing by the United States. (Related: A primer on the different types of nuclear weapons and how they affect humans and the environment.)\n\nCurrently, almost 13,000 nuclear weapons are being held in arsenals around the world at a time when the risks of proliferation are growing and guardrails to prevent escalation are weakening.\n\nThe United States, China, Russia, Britain and France, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, pledged in January that they will prevent further dissemination of nuclear weapons.\n\nHowever, during the last review conference in 2015, the parties were unable to reach an agreement on substantive issues.\n\nAnd the threat of nuclear proliferation is only growing. Iran has already reported having enough uranium to build one, if not two bombs, as ex-U.S. diplomat and nuclear weapons expert Robert Joseph warned.\n\nThe U.S. and its nuclear allies also rebuked Russia for its \"irresponsible and dangerous talk about the possibility of deploying nuclear weapons\" as a review of the keystone nuclear treaty opened.\n\n\"Following Russia's unprovoked and unlawful war of aggression against Ukraine, we call on Russia to cease its irresponsible and dangerous nuclear rhetoric and behavior, to uphold its international commitments,\" the U.S., France and Britain said in a statement\n\n\"Nuclear weapons, for as long as they exist, should serve defensive purposes, deter aggression and prevent war. We condemn those who would use or threaten to use nuclear weapons for military coercion, intimidation and blackmail.\"\n\nThis call was issued as there had been concerns about the spread of nuclear technology, especially in Iran and North Korea, and China's rapid expansion of its nuclear arsenal.\n\nWhile five leading nuclear powers are among the 191 states that are included in the pact, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea are not, which is why the NPT stated that further reduction of the risk of nuclear war must be a priority for them. (Related: North Korea vows to test more nuclear weapons, aims threats at US.)\n\nNPT said Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon.

\"geopolitical tensions reaching new highs\" while some governments, in a false bid for peace and security, are spending \"billions on nuclear weapons\" has put \"humanity\" one misstep away from \"nuclear annihilation\"\n\nAntonio Guterres was speaking at the opening of the Tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) which runs until August 26.\n\nHe said, \"to [underscore] the importance of this conference, I will be in a few days in Hiroshima at the anniversary of the first nuclear bombardment in human history.\"\n\n\"Humanity is in danger of forgetting the lessons forged in the terrifying fires of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Geopolitical tensions are reaching new highs,\" he warned.\n\nThe United States remains the only country in the world and in history to have ever used nuclear weapons to massacre other people when it dropped two atomic bombs on Japan. The first on the city of Hiroshima and the second on Nagasaki city, wiping them both out of existence.\n\nGuterres says \"states are seeking false security in stockpiling and spending hundreds of billions of dollars on doomsday weapons that have no place on our planet.\"\n\n\"Almost 13,000 nuclear weapons are now being held in arsenals around the world. All this at a time when the risks of proliferation are growing and guardrails to prevent escalation are weakening,\" he said.\n\n\"The clouds that parted following the end of the Cold War are gathering once more,\" Guterres warned \"today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation.\" We need the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as much as ever.\"\n\nHe noted that the conference is an opportunity to hammer out the measures that will help avoid a certain disaster and help return the world on a new path \"free of nuclear weapons\"\n\nThere are only a handful of countries that have nuclear weapons. Tensions in the West Asia region tend to stem from the Israeli regime. The apartheid occupation not only occupies Palestinian land but is also in possession of hundreds of nuclear weapons.\n\nAt the same time the regime is not a party to any nuclear treaty, nor does it allow the International Atomic Energy Organization (The IAEA or UN nuclear watchdog) to inspect any of its nuclear weapons sites. Ironically, Israel was not exposed during the UN Secretary General's speech.\n\nOn the other hand, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been under the most robust IAEA inspections regime despite having a civilian nuclear program for energy and all the reports from the UN nuclear watchdog have stated Iran's program is peaceful.\n\nIran has regularly voiced its strong opposition to any nation possessing nuclear weapons or any weapons of mass destruction at all. The country itself has been subject to attacks by weapons of mass destruction, the survivors of which are still suffering from the effects today in Iranian hospitals.\n\nElsewhere, the Secretary-General outlined five areas for action, starting with reinforcing and reaffirming the norm against the use of nuclear weapons, which he underlined, requires steadfast commitment.\n\nHe said \"we urgently need to reinforce and reaffirm the 77-year-old norm against the use of nuclear weapons. This requires a steadfast commitment from all States Parties. It means finding practical measures that will reduce the risk of nuclear war and put us back on the path to disarmament.\"\n\n\"We need to strengthen all avenues of dialogue and transparency.\n\nPeace cannot take hold in an absence of trust and mutual respect.\"\n\nHe also cited that \"reducing the risk of war is not enough. Eliminating nuclear weapons is the only guarantee they will never be used. We must work relentlessly towards this goal,\" he pointed out.\n\n\"This must start with new commitments to shrink the numbers of all kinds of nuclear weapons so that they no longer hang by a thread over humanity.\"\n\nThe UN Secretary-General cited the fighting in Ukraine among the conflicts driving the risk to a level not seen since the height of the Cold War. \"All this at a time when the risks of proliferation are growing and guardrails to prevent escalation are weakening,\" he noted.\n\nAlso addressing the opening day of the conference, Russian President Vladimir Putin said there can be no winners in a nuclear war, and such a war \"must never be fought\".\n\n\"We advocate equal and inseparable security for all members of the international community,\" he underscored in a message of greeting uploaded to the Kremlin's website.\n\nPutin said that Russia as a signatory to the NPT consistently followed its letter and spirit. \"our obligations under bilateral agreements with the United States on the reduction and limitation of relevant weapons have also been fulfilled,\" he said.\n\nThe Russian leader stressed that over the more than half of a century of its existence, the NPT had become one of the key elements of the international system of security and strategic stability.\n\nThe commitments that it stipulates in the spheres of non-proliferation, disarmament, and the peaceful uses of nuclear powerfully meet the interests of both nuclear and non-nuclear states.\n\n\"We are convinced that all NPT-compliant countries should have the right of access to civilian nuclear power without any additional terms whatsoever. We are ready to share with the partners our experience in the field of nuclear energy,\" he pointed out.\n\nHe stressed that Moscow attaches great importance to the IAEA guarantee system \"as a verification mechanism of the NPT and believes that it is very important to ensure its unbiased, depoliticized and technically grounded use.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Putin expressed the certainty that the conference would confirm the readiness of all NPT member countries to strictly comply with their commitments and make a tangible contribution to enhancing non-proliferation and world peace, security, and stability.\n\nRussia wants to find out whether U.S. President Joe Biden's remarks about the need to negotiate a treaty to replace the New START when it expires in 2026 were an invitation to dialogue or just \"lofty rhetoric,\" Russian diplomats have said.\n\nThe Russian delegation to the 10th Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) said in a statement, published by Russia's permanent mission that \"[U.S.] Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken cited President Biden's words regarding the readiness of the U.S. administration to negotiate a new arms control framework to replace New START when it expires in 2026. The U.S. President added that negotiation required a willing partner (implying Russia) 'operating in good faith.' We truly wonder if the U.S. side is indeed ready to negotiate or if it is mere 'lofty rhetoric',\"\n\n\"It was the United States that unilaterally withdrew from the dialogue on strategic stability with Russia citing the developments around Ukraine as a pretext,\" the delegation said.\n\nRussia has accused the West of waging a \"proxy war\" against it by arming Ukraine and imposing sanctions on Moscow.\n\n\"The U.S. did this even though the goal of that dialogue was to lay down the groundwork for future arms control and risk reduction measures, i.a. with a view to making new relevant agreements. So it is high time Washington made up its mind, stopped rushing around, and told us frankly what it is that they want - escalate the situation in the area of international security or embark on equal negotiations.\"\n\nThe New START Treaty was struck in 2011, the treaty has been extended to the end of February 4, 2026.\n\nAmong the many agreements, Washington, in particular, former President Trump withdrew the United States from, was the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty with Russia in a blow to world peace and security.", "source": {"uri": "tehrantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tehran Times"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://media.tehrantimes.com/d/t/2022/06/28/4/4195513.jpg?ts=1656433865938", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 17, "stanza_neu": 36, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 55, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7136690261", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "09:26:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T09:26:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T09:26:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8117647171020508, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/world/world-nuclear-annihilation-un-chief-antonio-guterres-b2136182.html", "title": "World is 'one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation', says UN chief", "body": "I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

He is the first Japanese leader to attend the gathering, showing his determination as a representative elected in the atomic-bombed city of Hiroshima.\n\nThe global nuclear arms situation is becoming increasingly difficult. Just when nuclear disarmament efforts had become sluggish amid disagreements between nuclear and non-nuclear states, Russia invaded Ukraine. Moscow then threatened the world by hinting that it was ready to use atomic weapons, and occupied a nuclear power plant in Ukraine.\n\nThe NPT is a framework for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. And it's facing a crucial test today as concerns mount that we could see another nuclear weapons catastrophe.\n\nIn his review conference speech, Prime Minister Kishida condemned Moscow, saying, \"We should never tolerate the threat of the use of nuclear weapons, such as that made recently by Russia, let alone the use of nuclear weapons.\" He also pleaded that \"every realistic measure toward a world without nuclear weapons\" must be taken \"step by step.\"\n\nKishida then announced a five-point action plan as a first step in this \"realistic road map,\" which included non-use of nuclear weapons, increased transparency centering on information disclosure, and the reduction of nuclear warheads. He also stated that Japan encourages the United States and China to hold a nuclear arms reduction dialogue.\n\nAt the same time, Kishida's speech entirely skipped the across-the-board Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty, which prohibits the use, stockpiling and threat to use nuclear arms. This disappointed atomic bomb survivors, or hibakusha. Kishida has claimed that Japan will be a bridge between nuclear and non-nuclear nations, but he did not touch on that in his speech either.\n\nJapan didn't participate in the first meeting of the nuclear ban treaty parties in June even as an observer. That was a stark contrast to Germany and Norway, countries just like Japan that depend on U.S. nuclear deterrence. The two European nations joined the meeting as observers and declared their own opinions, while explaining that they would not be signing the treaty.\n\nLooking at Asia, North Korea is accelerating nuclear development and China is enhancing its nuclear capabilities. Japan, meanwhile, wants to abolish nuclear weapons as the only country to be attacked with them in war, while also depending on the U.S. \"nuclear umbrella\" and requesting enhanced nuclear deterrence.

Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula seems as remote as ever, despite developments under the previous US administration raising hopes of a breakthrough. The Ukraine crisis has created renewed fears of a potential nuclear confrontation, or accident. And the fear of nuclear terrorism remains.\n\nWorse, the United States, which boasts one of the world's largest and most advanced nuclear arsenals, has been behaving in an increasingly irresponsible manner that poses a threat to global strategic security. It is investing trillions of dollars in developing low-yield nuclear weapons while lowering the threshold for its use of nuclear weapons. It has also withdrawn from one international treaty after another, including the Iran nuclear agreement, and is creating a nuclear clique in the Asia-Pacific region by forming AUKUS, a security alliance with the United Kingdom and Australia. Under this framework the US and the UK will supply nuclear-powered submarine technology to Australia. As others have pointed out, this breaches the letter and spirit of the NPT.

Secretary General Antonio Guterres emphasizing the importance of striving toward nuclear disarmament. This was followed by the commencement of speeches by representatives of each member country.\n\nKishida -- the first Japanese prime minister to attend an NPT review conference -- was elected from a constituency in Hiroshima City, which was hit by an atomic bomb near the end of World War II. Kishida has often said that nuclear disarmament is a central plank of his lifework.\n\n\"I have come to the review conference driven by a strong sense of urgency,\" Kishida said at the start of his speech. \"I cannot but admit that the path to a world without nuclear weapons has become ever harder. Nevertheless, giving up is not an option.\"\n\nKishida has taken a chance by attending the conference in his capacity as prime minister: The previous conference held seven years ago ended in disarray -- if it fails to produce results this time around, the very existence of the NPT could be called into question.\n\nIn the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, Russian President Vladimir Putin intimidated the international community by saying Moscow is one of the world's most powerful nuclear states. Putin's words have made the prospect of nuclear disarmament much more difficult. As a result, the international community has increasingly been focusing on nuclear deterrence, and the push for nuclear disarmament has started to wane.\n\n\"The threat to use nuclear weapons by Russia in its aggression against Ukraine has contributed to worldwide concern that yet another catastrophe by nuclear weapon use is a real possibility,\" Kishida said in his speech. \"We should never tolerate the threat of the use of nuclear weapons, let alone the use of nuclear weapons.\"\n\nKishida also stressed that \"Japan is determined to firmly uphold the NPT as its guardian,\" in effect expressing a strong desire for this latest conference to serve as a turning point on nuclear disarmament.\n\nThe prime minister's \"Hiroshima Action Plan\" is based on five pillars: continuing the non-use of nuclear weapons; enhancing the transparency of nuclear capabilities; maintaining the decreasing trend in the global nuclear stockpile; securing nuclear non-proliferation and promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy; and encouraging international leaders and others to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nWith China and the issue of enhanced transparency in mind, Kishida called on all nuclear-weapon states to disclose information on their respective production of fissile materials, such as highly enriched uranium and plutonium, both of which can be used to make nuclear weapons. On nuclear arms reduction, Kishida urged Washington and Beijing to hold talks on nuclear arms control and disarmament.\n\nTo build momentum toward the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, Kishida proposed convening a leader-level meeting of the Friends of the CTBT during a U.N. General Assembly meeting in September.\n\nThe $10 million Youth Leader Fund for a world without nuclear weapons is aimed at fostering next-generation leaders who will engage in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.\n\nThe NPT review conference is slated to last about four weeks. Following speeches by representatives of each member nation from Monday through Thursday, participating states will discuss three themes -- nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear power -- with the aim of adopting a final document.\n\nThe previous conference failed to adopt a final document. And, in light of current world circumstances, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and China boosting its nuclear capabilities, it is possible that negotiations will run into difficulties at this conference, too.\n\nBiden, Putin strike conciliatory tone as nuclear arms talks start at UN", "source": {"uri": "newsinfo.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer.net"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/files/2022/08/kishida-NY-e1659491836826.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 6, "stanza_neu": 20, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 27, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7137449256", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "21:10:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T21:10:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T21:10:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.772549033164978, "url": "https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-89865.html", "title": "\" At the tipping point - address nuclear risks & return to the path of disarmament \" (en)", "body": "New York, 02.08.2022 - Rede von Bundespr\u00e4sident und EDA-Vorsteher Ignazio Cassis anl\u00e4sslich der \u00dcberpr\u00fcfungskonferenz der Vertragsstaaten des Atomwaffensperrvertrags (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT) 2022 in New York - es gilt das gesprochene Wort.\n\nSixty years ago, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the world stared into an abyss.

Moreover, the arms control system, which has traditionally been a core pillar of international security and stability, is currently facing a crisis that has no precedent in recent history in terms of its scale.\n\nVishnevetsky made no mention of Putin's warning and action after invading Ukraine, but he said given the current situation it is more critical than ever that the nuclear powers behave with restraint and responsibility.\n\nHe noted that in a joint statement in January the five nuclear powers Russia, United States, China, Britain and France reiterated that a nuclear war should never be fought and can't be won and emphasised the need to prevent not only a nuclear confrontation but also any military confrontation between nuclear powers.\n\nIt is imperative that all signatories demonstrate in deeds their commitment to these provisions, the Russian official said.\n\nThe review conference, which ends Aug 26, is aimed at strengthening the NPT, which is considered the cornerstone of international disarmament efforts. Its goal is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and eventually achieve a nuclear-free world, and it has the widest support of any arms control agreement, with 191 parties to the treaty.\n\nUnder the NPT's provisions, the five original nuclear powers agreed to negotiate toward eliminating their arsenals someday and nations without nuclear weapons promised not to acquire them in exchange for a guarantee to be able to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\n\nChinese Ambassador Fu Cong, head of the Foreign Ministry's arms control department, whose country has close ties to Russia, told delegates Tuesday that the NPT is significantly strained and even faces new and the most severe challenges since the end of the Cold War.\n\nThe specter of Cold War mentality is there to stay, he said, pointing to a deteriorating global strategic security environment, the outdated approach to security based on military alliances and the growing risk of an arms race and conflicts.\n\nFu called for the five nuclear powers to work together to reduce nuclear risks, strengthen communications on strategic stability and conduct in-depth dialogue on reducing the role of nuclear weapons in their national security doctrines and on a broad range of issues including missile defence, outer space, cyberspace, and artificial intelligence.\n\nBlinken, America's top diplomat, said Monday that the US chose to act with restraint in response to Russia's actions and avoid anything that could unintentionally raise nuclear tensions. As examples, he said the US abandoned previously scheduled tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles and did not raise the alert status of its nuclear forces in response to Russia's saber-rattling.\n\nThere is no place in our world no place in our world for nuclear deterrence based on coercion, intimidation or blackmail, Blinken said. We have to stand together in rejecting this.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sounded the alarm at Monday's opening over the war in Ukraine, nuclear threats in Asia and the Middle East, and other tensions, warning that humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation.\n\nBlinken said the US, United Kingdom and France have released a set of principles and best practices that all NPT nuclear weapon states should adhere to, among them that every effort has to be made to ensure that nuclear weapons are not used again.\n\n(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\n\nBusiness Standard has always strived hard to provide up-to-date information and commentary on developments that are of interest to you and have wider political and economic implications for the country and the world.

Russia's unacceptable nuclear threats made earlier this year in the context of its military aggression against Ukraine remind us once again of the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads.\n\nAny use of nuclear weapons would break the 75-year-old nuclear taboo and risk further escalation. We all know that any use of nuclear weapons would have catastrophic humanitarian consequences. This conference should strengthen the norm against the use of nuclear weapons.\n\n1. Return to the path of arms control and disarmament\n\nNuclear risks are higher than ever before since the end of the Cold War. We should agree on measures to reduce nuclear risks and to enhance resilience in times of crises. This conference must set the course for an urgently needed change: to reduce the role of nuclear weapons, to reduce the likelihood of a nuclear accident or usage as a result of a misunderstanding. Words must be complemented by concrete action to avert humanitarian and environmental disasters.\n\nSwitzerland, together with our partner from the Stockholm Initiative, has therefore presented a working paper containing a package of measures to reduce nuclear risks now, before it is too late.\n\nBut nuclear risks will remain until the last of these weapons is dismantled. We therefore call on the nuclear states to abandon the nuclear build-up and the parade of nuclear arsenals - to return to the path of arms control and disarmament.\n\nEven as the reduction of nuclear arsenals has stalled, we must reaffirm our goal: a world without nuclear weapons. Together with the Stockholm Initiative, we have outlined 26 Stepping Stones.2. Political will to address regional non-proliferation challenges\n\nMr Chairman,\n\nRecent international developments have shown the vulnerabilities of civilian nuclear facilities. We have to ensure that nuclear facilities are safe and secure under all circumstances. Failure to do so would result in catastrophic humanitarian and environmental consequences. I comend the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for defining the seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety and security, which must be respected and implemented under all circumstances. Compliance with these seven pillars allows us to use nuclear energy peacefully and safely.\n\nTo ensure the NPT's effectiveness, we must uphold its non-proliferation norm: In particular, we need to address regional challenges and, for example, condemn the DPRK's continued development of its nuclear programme, in violation of UN Security Council resolutions. We also need an immediate return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action by all its parties. And we must support the IAEA's safeguards system, which is the backbone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime.\n\n3. The promotion of peace and security is a priority\n\nMr Chairman,\n\nLast year, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons entered into force. As an observer state, wonders whether this new treaty can find its place in the normative architecture built around the NPT, and whether efforts in this field can be complementary. Is it possible to achieve nuclear disarmament without the nuclear weapon states?\n\nMr. Chairman,\n\nPromoting peace and security is one of Switzerland's top priorities. We are committed to facilitating dialogue and building bridges, including at this conference.\n\nCommunication FDFABundeshaus WestCH-3003 BernTel. Communication service: 41 58 462 31 53Tel.

No nuclear weapons should ever be used and there is nothing that justifies their salience in the military and security doctrine of any nation,\" Secretary of Foreign Affairs Enrique Manalo said in a statement on Monday evening.\n\nManila emphasized that international instruments such as the NPT \"are fundamental to a rules-based international order that sustains the security of nations and the conditions for our peoples to thrive in peace.\"\n\nThe Philippines also said that the NPT serves as an important avenue to \"enhance transparency and establish security dialogue mechanisms among relevant regional actors.\"\n\nThe treaty, which entered into force in 1970, aims to prevent the use of nuclear weapons and their technology. Conference participants are now tasked to look into how the treaty is being implemented.\n\n\"The Review Conference is an opportunity to affirm that the Treaty is on a solid footing 50 years after its adoption, and the spirit of constructive multilateralism prevails among nations, notwithstanding geopolitical challenges and conflicts,\" Manalo said.\n\nThe Philippines also emphasized that the NPT is important in keeping nuclear states in the direction of getting rid of their stockpiles as well as discussing the modernisation of nuclear arsenals.\n\n\"We support efforts towards nuclear risk reduction as an intervening measure while we work towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons,\" Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs for Multilateral Affairs and International Economic Relations Carlos Sorreta said during the review conference.\n\nRussia's war on Ukraine\n\nMeanwhile, in their respective addresses for the review conference, both International Atomic Energy Agency director general Rafael Mariano Grossi and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed concern about Russia's recent move to seize Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.\n\nIt is said to be the largest in Europe and is one of the 10 biggest nuclear power plants in the world.\n\n\"Russia is now using the plant as a military base to fire at Ukrainians, knowing that they can't and won't shoot back because they might accidentally strike a nuclear a reactor or highly radioactive waste in storage,\" Blinken said in his remarks.\n\n\"That brings the notion of having a human shield to an entirely different and horrific level.\"\n\nBlinken noted that for Washington's part, it will not use any of its own nuclear weapons. He said they will only look at using these weapons should there be nuclear attacks against the US, its allies, and partners and will only \"consider\" the use of the weapons in extreme circumstances.\n\nRussia's occupation of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant comes after it also seized the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and exclusion zone.\n\nIAEA's Grossi said \"every single one\" of its seven pillars of nuclear safety and security has been compromised at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. This means that nuclear facilities are not being maintained, safety and security systems are not fully functional at all times, among others.\n\nNuclear as power source amid crisis\n\nHowever, Grossi also noted nuclear energy generation's potential role, along with renewable energy resources, in alleviating the world's energy crisis.\n\n\"In Member States with established programmes, the IAEA provides support for safe lifetime extensions and in the management of radioactive waste,\" Grossi said.\n\nThe IAEA likewise supports \"newcomer countries\" in creating infrastructure and institutions that would provide a safe and sustainable nuclear energy programme.\n\nGrossi said 32 countries are already generating 394 gigawatts of electricity through 440 nuclear power reactors and 55 more reactors are under construction across 17 countries. These are seen to generate a capacity of nearly 57 gigawatts once completed.\n\n\"Asia is seeing the highest capacity growth, with major economies building and investing heavily in nuclear power,\" Grossi said.\n\nBack home, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has repeatedly said that the country needs to \"re-examine\" its strategy on nuclear power plants and look into developing fossil gas to aid in its current energy crisis.\n\nFrance said it is already in the \"early stages\" of discussions to help Manila achieve its goal of introducing nuclear into its energy mix.", "source": {"uri": "intellasia.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "IntellAsia"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 15, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 30, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7137662503", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-03", "time": "02:57:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-03T02:57:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-03T02:57:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "url": "https://www.chinadailyhk.com/article/283902", "title": "'Countries with largest nuke arsenals should reduce warheads 1st'", "body": "This Aug 2, 2022 file photo from the official Twitter account of Fu Cong shows Fu Cong, director-general of the Department of Arms Control of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, speaking at the 10th Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons at the UN headquarters in New York.\n\nUNITED NATIONS - The countries with the largest nuclear arsenals should further conduct a significant and substantive reduction in their nuclear arsenals in a verifiable, irreversible and legally binding manner, said a Chinese disarmament official on Tuesday.\n\nThe principles of \"maintaining global strategic stability\" and \"undiminished security for all\" should be followed in the practices of nuclear disarmament, Fu Cong told the 10th Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\n\nNuclear-weapon states also need to work together to reduce nuclear risks, said Fu Cong, head of the Chinese delegation and director-general of the Department of Arms Control of the Chinese Foreign Ministry\n\nThe countries with the largest nuclear arsenals taking the lead in reduction will create conditions for other nuclear-weapon states to join the nuclear disarmament process, he said.\n\nNuclear-weapon states also need to work together to reduce nuclear risks, said Fu, head of the Chinese delegation and director-general of the Department of Arms Control of the Chinese Foreign Ministry.\n\nALSO READ: Chance to clear gathering nuclear clouds\n\nOn Jan 3 this year, the leaders of China, Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom and France issued a joint statement, stressing that a nuclear war cannot be won and must not be fought, and reaffirming that none of their nuclear weapons are targeted at each other or at any other state.

Secretary General Antonio Guterres emphasizing the importance of striving toward nuclear disarmament. This was followed by the commencement of speeches by representatives of each member country.\n\nKishida -- the first Japanese prime minister to attend an NPT review conference -- was elected from a constituency in Hiroshima City, which was hit by an atomic bomb near the end of World War II. Kishida has often said that nuclear disarmament is a central plank of his lifework.\n\n\"I have come to the review conference driven by a strong sense of urgency,\" Kishida said at the start of his speech. \"I cannot but admit that the path to a world without nuclear weapons has become ever harder. Nevertheless, giving up is not an option.\"\n\nKishida has taken a chance by attending the conference in his capacity as prime minister: The previous conference held seven years ago ended in disarray -- if it fails to produce results this time around, the very existence of the NPT could be called into question.\n\nIn the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, Russian President Vladimir Putin intimidated the international community by saying Moscow is one of the world's most powerful nuclear states. Putin's words have made the prospect of nuclear disarmament much more difficult. As a result, the international community has increasingly been focusing on nuclear deterrence, and the push for nuclear disarmament has started to wane.\n\n\"The threat to use nuclear weapons by Russia in its aggression against Ukraine has contributed to worldwide concern that yet another catastrophe by nuclear weapon use is a real possibility,\" Kishida said in his speech. \"We should never tolerate the threat of the use of nuclear weapons, let alone the use of nuclear weapons.\"\n\nKishida also stressed that \"Japan is determined to firmly uphold the NPT as its guardian,\" in effect expressing a strong desire for this latest conference to serve as a turning point on nuclear disarmament.\n\nThe prime minister's \"Hiroshima Action Plan\" is based on five pillars: continuing the non-use of nuclear weapons; enhancing the transparency of nuclear capabilities; maintaining the decreasing trend in the global nuclear stockpile; securing nuclear non-proliferation and promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy; and encouraging international leaders and others to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nWith China and the issue of enhanced transparency in mind, Kishida called on all nuclear-weapon states to disclose information on their respective production of fissile materials, such as highly enriched uranium and plutonium, both of which can be used to make nuclear weapons. On nuclear arms reduction, Kishida urged Washington and Beijing to hold talks on nuclear arms control and disarmament.\n\nTo build momentum toward the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, Kishida proposed convening a leader-level meeting of the Friends of the CTBT during a U.N. General Assembly meeting in September.\n\nThe $10 million Youth Leader Fund for a world without nuclear weapons is aimed at fostering next-generation leaders who will engage in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.\n\nThe NPT review conference is slated to last about four weeks. Following speeches by representatives of each member nation from Monday through Thursday, participating states will discuss three themes -- nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear power -- with the aim of adopting a final document.\n\nThe previous conference failed to adopt a final document.

Its goal is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and eventually achieve a nuclear-free world, and it has the widest support of any arms control agreement, with 191 parties to the treaty.\n\nUnder the NPT's provisions, the five original nuclear powers agreed to negotiate toward eliminating their arsenals someday and nations without nuclear weapons promised not to acquire them in exchange for a guarantee to be able to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\n\nChinese Ambassador Fu Cong, head of the Foreign Ministry's arms control department, whose country has close ties to Russia, told delegates Tuesday that the NPT is significantly strained and even faces new and the most severe challenges since the end of the Cold War .\n\nThe specter of Cold War mentality is there to stay, he said, pointing to a deteriorating global strategic security environment, the outdated approach to security based on military alliances and the growing risk of an arms race and conflicts.\n\nFu called for the five nuclear powers to work together to reduce nuclear risks, strengthen communications on strategic stability and conduct in-depth dialogue on reducing the role of nuclear weapons in their national security doctrines and on a broad range of issues including missile defence, outer space, cyberspace, and artificial intelligence .\n\nBlinken, America's top diplomat, said Monday that the US chose to act with restraint in response to Russia's actions and avoid anything that could unintentionally raise nuclear tensions. As examples, he said the US abandoned previously scheduled tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles and did not raise the alert status of its nuclear forces in response to Russia's saber-rattling .\n\nThere is no place in our world no place in our world for nuclear deterrence based on coercion, intimidation or blackmail, Blinken said. We have to stand together in rejecting this.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sounded the alarm at Monday's opening over the war in Ukraine, nuclear threats in Asia and the Middle East, and other tensions, warning that humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation .", "source": {"uri": "inventiva.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inventiva"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.inventiva.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/putin-plans-legal-challenge-over-frozen-currency-reserves-live-updates-8.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 9, "stanza_neu": 17, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 26, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7137680541", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-03", "time": "03:22:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-03T03:22:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-03T03:21:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7568627595901489, "url": "https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/editorial/yomiuri-editorial/20220803-49110/", "title": "Present road map for world to build consensus on nuclear disarmament", "body": "If the nuclear disarmament system is enfeebled, international order will collapse. The consensus-building efforts and wisdom of each country are being put to the test.\n\nA review conference of the parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) has begun at U.N. headquarters. This is an opportunity for the more than 190 signatory nations to meet to discuss such topics as nuclear disarmament, ordinarily once every five years. However, having been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, the conference this time is the first in seven years.\n\nDuring the about four-week session, it is necessary to clarify a concrete path toward nuclear disarmament. The focus is on whether an outcome document can be compiled in the end.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin issued a statement in line with the start of the conference, saying that Russia consistently follows the treaty's letter and spirit. While Russia invaded Ukraine and Putin has made intimidating remarks repeatedly indicating a possible use of nuclear weapons, it is appalling that Moscow issued such a statement.\n\nIt is obvious that Russia's actions violate the U.N. Charter, which prohibits the threat or use of force. At the review conference, it is necessary, first and foremost, to affirm the NPT's principle of no use of nuclear weapons.\n\nAt the last conference in 2015, nuclear powers and nonnuclear nations were at loggerheads over the denuclearization of the Middle East and failed to adopt an agreement document. The gap between the two sides is widening even more now.\n\nAside from the NPT, some African and other nonnuclear nations that have signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, in their first meeting of states parties to that treaty in June, called for the prohibition of the possession of nuclear weapons.\n\nAs that treaty does not mention the role that nuclear deterrence plays in security, nuclear powers, as well as U.S. allies such as Japan and South Korea, do not participate in the treaty.\n\nThe abolition of nuclear weapons is a high ideal, but Japan, which faces nuclear threats from North Korea, China and Russia, cannot maintain its peace and safety without the U.S. nuclear umbrella. To work to advance nuclear disarmament while looking squarely at such facts is only realistic.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida became the first Japanese prime minister to attend an NPT review conference and called on nuclear powers to draw up an action plan for nuclear disarmament in his speech. He also announced that Japan will donate $10 million to the United Nations to create a fund to invite young people from around the world to atomic-bombed cities in Japan.\n\nAs the only country to have suffered atomic bombings, Japan has a major role to play in this regard. Japan must continue to act as a bridge between nuclear and nonnuclear states.\n\nThe United States and Russia, which together possess 90% of the world's nuclear warheads, have signed the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), which obliges them to conduct mutual inspections, among other measures. But China, which does not participate in such an arms management system, is modernizing and stepping up its nuclear capabilities -- a situation that cannot be left unattended.\n\nIt is important for the international community to continue asking Beijing to, at the very least, disclose the number of nuclear warheads it possesses and to participate in the framework for nuclear disarmament.", "source": {"uri": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp", "dataType": "news", "title": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/wp-content/themes/thejapannews_ver1/Images/the-japannews-sns.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 5, "stanza_neu": 18, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 24, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7137700582", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-03", "time": "03:50:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-03T03:50:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-03T03:50:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7568627595901489, "url": "http://tribune.com.pk/story/2369164/threat-of-nuclear-war", "title": "Threat of nuclear war", "body": "Any misunderstanding amid rising tensions among nuclear-armed states could lead to a nuclear war, and several prominent figures around the world, including UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, are warning that rhetoric and aggression needs to be brought in check to prevent such an eventuality.\n\nHe was speaking at the 10 review conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which has largely failed to meet its objectives since India, Pakistan, North Korea, and allegedly Israel managed to go nuclear since it was signed, while South Africa built and willfully dismantled a nuclear weapons programme since the NPT first came into being. Guterres singled out Russia for \"its dangerous nuclear rhetoric and behaviour\" as he noted that the world faced \"a nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War.\" He also noted how \"extraordinarily lucky\" humanity has been that such a misunderstanding or miscalculation has not already happened, before going on to say that luck should not be a strategy and arguing that a world free of nuclear weapons would be safer than a world which uses them as \"a shield from geopolitical tensions.\"\n\nThere is evidence to back up the statement including the events around the Cuban Missile Crisis, several false alarms that were resolved only due to cool-headed political figures and military officers, or the dozens of 'missing' nuclear weapons around the world. The US, for example, has at least six nuclear weapons unaccounted for, and some Soviet-era sources have claimed that about 100 nuclear weapons of varying yields may have gone missing during the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nHowever, the last NPT moot in 2015 yielded no substantive agreements on how to restrict the proliferation of nuclear weapons or expanding recognition as nuclear weapons states to Pakistan and India, which have been responsible actors since making their nuclear capabilities known.\n\nWithout fully involving the known players, any efforts to eventually move towards denuclearisation will remain futile -- the five permanent UN Security Council members, who are all military powerhouses and also the only 'recognised' nuclear powers, cannot expect the rest of the world to blindly accept their open hypocrisy as they continue to hold enough weapons to destroy the world many times over, while punishing smaller nations that believe nuclear weapons are the key to a secure existence.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [], "image": " https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Editorial-Opinion-copy1/Editorial-Opinion-copy1.jpg  ", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 1, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 8, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7138257335", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-03", "time": "12:36:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-03T12:36:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-03T11:47:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "url": "https://www.spacewar.com/reports/US_allies_hit_Russia_for_dangerous_nuclear_rhetoric_ahead_of_UN_talks_999.html", "title": "US, allies hit Russia for 'dangerous' nuclear rhetoric; 'No winners' in nuclear war says Putin", "body": "In May, Russian editor and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry Muratov warned that the Kremlin's \"propaganda warriors\" were striving to make nuclear weapons use more palatable to the Russian public.\n\nThe United States and its nuclear allies rebuked Russia Monday for \"irresponsible and dangerous\" talk about possibly deploying nuclear weapons as a review of the keystone nuclear treaty opened at the United Nations.\n\n\"Following Russia's unprovoked and unlawful war of aggression against Ukraine, we call on Russia to cease its irresponsible and dangerous nuclear rhetoric and behavior, to uphold its international commitments,\" said the United States, France and Britain in a statement.\n\n\"Nuclear weapons, for as long as they exist, should serve defensive purposes, deter aggression, and prevent war.

Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said the world was \"in a different place\" after President Biden called Monday for talks on the 2011 deal.\n\nAt the U.N. meeting, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said the conflict in Ukraine was \"so grave that the specter of a potential nuclear confrontation, or accident, has raised its terrifying head again.\"\n\nRafael Grossi said safety was at risk at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine -- Europe's largest nuclear plant which is under Russian control -- and urged support for his so far unsuccessful efforts to visit to the facility with a team from his U.N. watchdog.\n\nWhat to know about Ukraine's nuclear sites and the risks the Russian invasion could pose\n\nSpeakers from countries including Japan said the heightened nuclear rhetoric should not jeopardize the treaty's mission.\n\nThe four-week conference to review its progress presents \"an opportunity to hammer out the measures that will help avoid certain disaster,\" Guterres said. He urged countries not to forget \"the terrifying fires\" of Hiroshima, when the United States dropped an atomic bomb in 1945 that obliterated much of the Japanese city, and in Nagasaki days later -- the second and last time that bomb was used in war.\n\nThe Non-Proliferation Treaty, which went into force in 1970 and allows for nuclear energy for peaceful uses, has 191 members, more countries than any other arms control agreement.\n\nUnder its terms, the five nuclear powers -- the United States, China, the Soviet Union, Britain and France -- had agreed at the time to negotiate to eventually eliminate their arsenals, while countries without nuclear weapons pledged not to acquire them.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ellen_francis@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Ellen Francis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/35B3ULQRVAI63BECA3A4QTHI6I.jpg&w=1440", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.5764705882352941, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 3, "stanza_neu": 18, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 21, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7139372549", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-04", "time": "09:37:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-04T09:37:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-04T09:37:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/analysis/2022/08/04/nuclear-nightmares-why-the-un-is-reminding-us-of-the-prospect-of-our-anihilation.html", "title": "Analysis | Nuclear nightmares: Why the UN is reminding us of the prospect of our 'annihilation'", "body": "At this point, there are 12,705 working nuclear warheads on the planet, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n\nAs a child, in the 1960s and '70s, in the midst of the Cold War, David Welch would lie awake in bed at night and worry about a nuclear holocaust.\n\nThe thought that the next day might bring mushrooms clouds, radiation fallout, soot blocking out the sun, a nuclear winter, crop failures, famines and millions of deaths terrified him.\n\nHe was not alone in that fear.\n\nAn entire generation woke up each morning to a low-key existential crisis and went to bed each night with a nuclear sword of Damocles dangling over their heads. But, by and large, with the end of the Cold War, those fears abated and then receded, and a new generation of children went to bed instead worrying about terrorists and then climate change.\n\nAs it turns out, those nuclear fears may have been forgotten, but they are not gone.\n\nThis week, at the UN conference to review the 50-year-old Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) -- aimed at preventing the spread, and eventually achieving the global elimination, of nuclear weapons -- Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres sounded the alarm.\n\n\"Humanity,\" he said ominously, \"is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation.\"\n\nThat warning was echoed by a slew of delegates on the opening day of the conference, prompted largely by Russian President Vladimir Putin's sabre-rattling and thinly veiled nuclear threats during his invasion of Ukraine, but also provoked by North Korea's imminent nuclear testing and Iran's refusal to return to the 2015 agreement aimed at reining in that country's nuclear weapons development.\n\nThe grown-up Welch, now a professor of political science at the University of Waterloo, is still worried. The nuclear boogeyman under the bed never went away, he says, we just let him slip our minds.\n\n\"We've largely lost our horror of nuclear war,\" says Welch. \"At the end of the Cold War, people just thought, 'OK, problem solved. We don't have to worry about nuclear war now.'\n\n\"But the arsenals are still there. The real problem is some leader somewhere deciding that these are usable weapons.\"\n\nSome of the key signatories to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty signed in 1968 have not been living up to their commitments, says Welch. Although the big nuclear powers reduced their arsenals in the wake of the Cold War, there's been little progress toward a non-nuclear world since then, former U.S. President Barack Obama's 2009 vision of a world without nuclear weapons nothwithstanding.\n\nWorse, more countries -- India, Pakistan and North Korea -- have joined the nuclear club, and Iran has been knocking on the door.\n\nAt this point, there are 12,705 working nuclear warheads on the planet, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). That's a far sight less than during the Cold War, when, at its peak, the Soviet Union and the U.S. alone combined for more than 60,000.\n\nBut it's still more than enough to cause a global catastrophe, and the cracks in the veneer of the global nuclear stalemate are beginning to show.\n\n\"It's been a slow kind of creeping reality that nuclear weapons are not only still with us, but that tensions that could lead to nuclear confrontation are also increasing,\" says University of British Columbia political science professor Allen Sens.\n\n\"And then the Russian invasion of Ukraine was the threat that jumped out of the bushes, as it were. It became the immediate catalyst for a much more clear and present danger.\"\n\nThe countries that comprise those clear and present dangers can be divided into several blocs, loosely based on the size of their nuclear stockpiles.\n\nAt the top of the nuclear weapons food chain stand the two countries that faced off -- though it was the Soviet Union then -- during the Cold War.\n\nThey have, by far, the largest arsenals -- 5,428 and 5,977 warheads, respectively, more than 90 per cent of the global total -- and those arsenals have global reach.\n\nA nuclear conflict between the two superpowers is the absolute worst-case scenario, said Welch. It would have devastating global consequences, potentially a mass-extinction event for humanity.\n\n\"It could destroy civilization as we know it,\" he said. \"It could induce a nuclear winter, which would cause catastrophic global cooling, failure of agriculture, breakdown of food systems, wholesale disruption of all distribution networks.\n\n\"And then people start dying off by the by the tens of millions, hundreds of millions.\"\n\nBritain, France and China\n\nThe nuclear arsenals of Britain, France and China pale in comparison to Russia and the U.S., numbering in the low hundreds, rather than the thousands.\n\nTo Welch's mind, Britain and France have no business stockpiling the weapons, other than what he calls \"prestige and a sense of anachronistic great power-ness.\"\n\nChina, however, has tense relations with much of the Western world. Those tensions were on full display this week amid U.S. Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\n\"The Chinese regime is, generally, pretty risk averse, so that's a good thing,\" says Welch. But the priority there is maintaining power and control.\n\n\"If they became convinced, for whatever reason, that a conflict with the United States was inevitable, they might very strongly feel tempted to use their nuclear weapons before they lost them.\"\n\nIsrael\n\nIsrael has never confirmed it has nuclear weapons. It's what Welch calls the \"worst-kept secret in the world.\" SPRI estimates the country's stockpile at 90 weapons.\n\nBut Israel benefits from its \"nuclear ambiguity policy,\" reaping the deterrent benefits of nuclear weapons at the same time as dodging criticisms for having them.\n\nIndia and Pakistan\n\nIndia and Pakistan, at 160 and 165 warheads, respectively, are less of a concern to most global observers. While they're not on the immediate radar as nuclear threat, any time there's a flare up between the two countries, conversations turn inevitably toward their possible use of their weapons.\n\nThat being said, the strong likelihood is that those weapons would be used on each other, causing a local, rather than global, catastrophe.\n\nNorth Korea\n\nThere is not a lot of detail available on the North Korea's nuclear capabilities. It's clear it has nuclear weapons -- SIPRI estimates 20 -- but it's not clear how powerful they are, or that it has the capability to deliver those weapons over long distances.\n\nThat still means that it has the potential to devastate the Korean Peninsula and possibly Japan, says Welch.\n\n\"It's a weird place, with a weird ideology, and pretty clearly a family dynasty,\" he says. \"Most people would say, for the Kim family, it's survival and power above all else. And if that means using nuclear weapons, no problem.\"\n\nThe missile-defence issue\n\nAll of these countries have significant nuclear weapon stockpiles, which is worrisome, but even more so is the advent of new technology -- delivery systems for warheads and missile defence systems, for example -- that can disrupt the delicate balance that has kept the nuclear nations in check, says UBC's Sens.\n\n\"The last thing you want is any country thinking it can get away with a first strike using nuclear weapons. You want both sides to be absolutely confident that they're going to be utterly destroyed -- mutually assured destruction.\"\n\nThat means new delivery systems, such as hypersonic cruise missiles -- those that travel many times the speed of sound -- have the potential to disrupt the status quo. They are reportedly being developed by the U.S., Russia and China.\n\nWith a superior delivery system, Country A could entertain the possibility that it could get away with a first strike on Country B, without fear of retaliation.\n\nCountry B, knowing that Country A has that capability, might be tempted into a pre-emptive first strike.\n\nThe same logic applies to missile defence systems such as Israel's famed Iron Dome, a system that detects incoming missiles, determines their trajectory and launches interceptor missiles to destroy them.\n\nIn a hypothetical situation in which Iran developed nuclear weapons and missiles to deliver them, Israel would likely be concerned that its missile defence system would be able to stop some, but not all, of the weapons heading its way.\n\nBut if Israel were to strike first, it could possibly degrade Iran's arsenal to the point that its Iron Dome could deal with the degraded retaliatory strike that comes next.\n\nFrom Iran's perspective, it might be considered foolhardy to give Israel a chance to fire first and degrade their capabilities. Its hypothetical response could well be to beat Israel to the punch by firing all its weapons first, knowing that some would make it through the Iron Dome.\n\n\"This is a horrible situation because now both countries ... have an incentive to strike first,\" says Sens. And the scenario applies to any nuclear powers facing a nuclear conflict.\n\nThat nuclear sword of Damocles -- that threat of mutually assured destruction -- is actually a good thing, observers say, the thing that, on an ongoing basis, keeps missiles from flying.\n\n\"The development of new delivery (and defence) systems promises to destabilize deterrence,\" says Sens.\n\n\"It upsets the logic of mutual assured destruction. It creates a danger that one side or the other might actually think that it can get away with launching a nuclear strike and maybe even winning a nuclear war.\"\n\nThe heightened political tension, the entrance of newer nuclear players, the advent of technology that threatens to destabilize the principles of deterrence, paired with the overall ineffectiveness of arms-control treaties all combine to paint a sombre picture.\n\nBut Sens says it's important to note that despite the stakes, despite flaring tensions in multiple spots on the globe, the prospects of a nuclear war are still quite remote.\n\n\"I think we've got to respect the fact that although the possible outcome, of course, could be catastrophic, the probability and the likelihood remains low.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://images.thestar.com/FoWH3aQFYO_K2_8MKi2YPMvQhhY=/1200x673/smart/filters:cb(1659579993160):format(webp)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/analysis/2022/08/04/nuclear-nightmares-why-the-un-is-reminding-us-of-the-prospect-of-our-anihilation/_main.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 28, "stanza_neu": 50, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 80, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7137123651", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "15:25:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T15:25:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T15:25:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.729411780834198, "url": "https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/un-world-one-miscalculation-away-%E2%80%98nuclear-annihilation%E2%80%99-203961", "title": "UN: World Is One Miscalculation Away From 'Nuclear Annihilation'", "body": "Officials from Germany, Japan, and the United States made similar arguments against the use of nuclear weapons on Monday during the conference's opening.\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres warned that repeated escalations of nuclear threats around the world -- including the conflict in Ukraine, the impending nuclearization of Iran, and rising tensions in Asia -- meant that the world was closer than it had ever been to a hostile nuclear incident, risking the onset of World War III and the destruction of modern civilization.\n\n\"Humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,\" Guterres said on Monday during his opening address at a United Nations (UN) conference intended to review the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or NPT. The conference was originally scheduled to be held in March 2020, commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the treaty's entry into force, but was delayed for two years after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nOfficials from Germany, Japan, and the United States made similar arguments against the use of nuclear weapons on Monday during the conference's opening, as did Rafael Grossi, the director of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). U.S. and allied officials also used their statements to criticize Russia, which has publicly speculated that it might use tactical nuclear weapons to break the deadlock in its six-month invasion of Ukraine -- rhetoric that U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken described as \"reckless, dangerous nuclear saber-rattling.\" German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock concurred, claiming that Moscow had engaged in \"reckless nuclear rhetoric\" that \"put...at risk everything the NPT has achieved in five decades.\"\n\nIn his remarks at the event, Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida also noted that the proliferation of nuclear weapons across the world had grown since 2015, the last time the United Nations had met to review the NPT. That session, Kishida observed, had ended without a \"consensus document\" on the future direction of global nonproliferation efforts. The Japanese leader also obliquely criticized Russia, noting that its statements on nuclear escalation during the Ukraine conflict had led to \"worldwide concern that yet another catastrophe by nuclear weapon use is a real possibility.\"\n\nAlthough Grossi largely refrained from direct criticism of Russia, he observed that nuclear power plants within Ukraine -- including the Zaporizhzhia plant in the country's southeast, the largest nuclear plant in Europe -- had been the site of recent battles within Ukraine. Clashes near nuclear plants risked the possibility that either side could damage the plant and release toxic radiation, Grossi said, creating a situation that was \"becoming more perilous by the day.\"\n\nBlinken suggested in his remarks that Russia was primarily responsible for the Zaporizhzhia crisis, as it had stationed troops and artillery at the plant and fired at Ukrainian positions with minimal danger of returning fire due to concerns about nuclear fallout. Russia has denied these allegations.\n\nIn remarks preceding the conference, Russian leader Vladimir Putin appeared to walk back previous warnings that he might use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, writing in a message on the Kremlin's website that he believed that \"a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\" Representatives from Russia are expected to speak at the conference on Tuesday, as are Chinese officials.", "source": {"uri": "nationalinterest.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National Interest"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/russia%20icbm%20%283%29.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 5, "stanza_neu": 11, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 16, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7139273282", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-04", "time": "08:11:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-04T08:11:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-04T07:59:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "url": "https://www.indy100.com/news/which-countries-have-nuclear-weapons-2657805004", "title": "Which countries have nuclear weapons?", "body": "Footage appears to show Russian bombs falling on facility 'housing nuclear reactor'\n\nAs of 2019, there were 15,000 nuclear weapons on planet Earth.

From the time of day to the weather, the location and surprisingly, clothing. White clothes can reflect some of the energy from a blast, whereas black would absorb it.\n\nOfficially recognised by the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), the nuclear-weapon states consist of China, France, United Kingdom, United States and Russia.

However, under Article VI of the NPT, they are not supposed to build and maintain such weapons.\n\nNorth Korea withdrew from the NPT in 2003, a move that was not legally recognised by the other states.\n\nIn this time, they had successfully tested nuclear devices and missiles. There is a lot of uncertainty surrounding how many warheads North Korea possess - though they are estimated to have produced enough material for 40-50. They also unveiled a centrifuge facility in 2010, which can produce highly enriched uranium for weapons.

Kishida had expressed a desire to attend the conference since he became prime minister last October. As a Hiroshima City-based politician, nuclear disarmament is both deeply personal and political for Kishida.\n\nHis resolve only strengthened following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, beginning this past February, and oblique Russian threats to use nuclear strikes. During his speech to the NPT review conference, Kishida addressed the present-day dangers of nuclear weapons: \"The threat to use nuclear weapons by Russia in its aggression against Ukraine has contributed to worldwide concern that yet another catastrophe by nuclear weapon use is a real possibility. We should never tolerate the threat of the use of nuclear weapons, let alone the use of nuclear weapons.\"\n\nBack in Japan, the Russian ambassador was not invited to this year's commemoration ceremony for the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Instead, Ambassador Mikhail Galuzin laid flowers at a memorial stone in the Peace Park a couple days early, on August 4. He was quoted as saying, \"I came to show Russia's positive attitude toward the reduction of nuclear arms.\" Galuzin went as far as to say, \"We [Russia] have no intention of using them [nuclear weapons]. This was not referred to directly or indirectly.\"\n\nWhatever Galuzin might believe about Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions, it is undeniable that the ongoing situation in Ukraine will likely make nuclear disarmament talks very difficult this year. Kishida's decision to attend the NPT review conference went against advisers from within his own circle, who argued against his attending a conference that was unlikely to produce tangible results and could end in disarray.\n\nKishida acknowledged this. His speech at the conference admitted, \"The path to a world without nuclear weapons has become even harder.\" But he continued to say, \"The NPT has served as the cornerstone of the international nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation regime in realizing international peace and security. Japan is determined to firmly uphold the NPT as its guardian.\"\n\nKishida's main contribution to the review conference was the Hiroshima Action Plan, which has five parts: the continued non-use of nuclear weapons; increasing transparency of nuclear capabilities; decreasing global nuclear stockpiles; promoting nuclear non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy; and encouraging educational visits to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In addition, Kishida also sought to build momentum toward the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty by proposing a meeting with leaders of Australia, Germany, and other nations on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly session this year. He also set up a $10 million Youth Leader Fund to encourage next-generation leaders engaging in the work of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation to travel to Japan.\n\nKishida's nuclear disarmament calendar is packed, with an international conference of political leaders planned for this November in Hiroshima to heighten momentum toward nuclear disarmament, and the G-7 summit to be held in Hiroshima next May. Kishida would like the leaders to visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park and museum together at that time.\n\nThe NPT review conference, set to run until August 26, will discuss three themes: nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation, and the peaceful use of nuclear power.\n\nKishida previously attended the NPT review conference in 2015 as Japan's foreign minister, the first to do so in a decade. That review conference ended with no document, as divisions between nuclear and non-nuclear powers remained deep.\n\nThis year's review conference is the first since then, as it was delayed for two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If this review conference also ends without meaningful agreements, the future of the NPT as the appropriate forum for dealing with nuclear disarmament may be called into question.\n\nKishida also became the first Japanese prime minister to attend the Non-proliferation and Disarmament Initiative (NPDI) meeting, encouraging them to work hard to produce a meaningful outcome.\n\nIn aiming for a non-nuclear world, Kishida insists on taking a path of engagement with the nuclear powers. For example, Japan has not ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), adopted in 2017, and did not attend the first meeting as an observer. Although non-nuclear states, NGOs, and atomic bomb survivors have criticized Kishida for maintaining distance from the TPNW, he remains committed to discussions with the nuclear powers.\n\nAccording to Asahi Shimbun, Kishida said \"The NPT meeting is the only gathering that brings both nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states to the same table. The key will be how to persuade the nuclear powers.\" As disillusioning as the path of engagement can be, he may believe there is no \"realistic\" alternative for Japan, which is surrounded by the nuclear powers of China, Russia, and North Korea, and protected by the U.S. nuclear umbrella.", "source": {"uri": "thediplomat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Diplomat Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mina_pollmann@thediplomat.com", "name": "Mina Pollmann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2022-08-04-171049.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 6, "stanza_neu": 27, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 35, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7137157487", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "15:55:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T15:55:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T14:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7215686440467834, "url": "https://world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Grossi-urges-world-to-recommit-to-nuclear-non-prol?feed=feed", "title": "Grossi urges world to 'recommit' to nuclear non-proliferation", "body": "In a time of \"global uncertainty, anxiety and fear\" the world \"must come together and recommit\" to \"nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament and to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy\", International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi has said.\n\nThe IAEA chief was speaking at the opening of the Tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons at the United Nations, in the USA.

The answer is yes; because it has been done before: Forty per cent of the nuclear power plants we still rely on today were built in the fast and sizable response to the oil shocks of the 1970s.\"\n\nHe said that \"everything in nuclear starts and ends with the guiding principle of safety and security first\".\n\nNuclear has never been safer, with changes brought in after being \"tested by fire and flood\" at Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011. \"But we are being tested once again. This time by war,\" he said.\n\nHe repeated his call for the IAEA to be given access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the largest in the country, which has been operated by its Ukrainian staff but under the control of Russian military forces since the start of March.\n\n\"While this war rages on, inaction is unconscionable. If an accident occurs at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, we will not have a natural disaster to blame. We will have only ourselves to answer to,\" he warned.\n\nHe said the IAEA was ready to return to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) \"as soon as a political agreement allows it to do so\" and said that on Iran, \"if we are to offer the world credible assurances that Iran's sizable and growing nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes, Iran must grant IAEA inspectors access commensurate to the breadth and depth of that programme and provide us the requisite and complete information\".\n\nAlso on the opening day of the meeting, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Russia of using Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as like a \"human shield\", saying: \"Russia is now using the plant as a military base to fire at Ukrainians, knowing that they can't and won't shoot back because they might accidentally strike a nuclear - a reactor or highly radioactive waste in storage. That brings the notion of having a human shield to an entirely different and horrific level.\"\n\nBlinken noted that since the NPT was drafted by 18 countries during the Cold War it has been joined by nearly all countries and \"nuclear weapon states moved toward disarmament, including the United States. The number of nuclear weapons in our stockpile is now nearly 90 percent lower than it was at its height in 1967\".\n\n\"This Review Conference is also an invaluable opportunity to discuss how to reduce the risk of nuclear conflict and the chance of miscommunication during a crisis\" and he said the US \"remains focused on enhancing the peaceful uses of nuclear technology ... helping the world to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and fight the climate crisis, giving farmers new tools to boost crop yields and tackle global food insecurity, improving our ability to screen for dangerous diseases, and preventing the next pandemic. The United States wants to expand access to these essential benefits for NPT states parties. Together with the United Kingdom, we're launching the Sustained Dialogue on Peaceful Uses to find new ways to use peaceful nuclear energy technology to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\"\n\nIn his opening remarks, United Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned that the storm clouds that had \"parted at the end of the Cold War are gathering once more\".\n\nHe said: \"Humanity is in danger of forgetting the lessons forged in the terrifying fires of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Geopolitical tensions are reaching new highs. Competition is trumping co-operation and collaboration. Distrust has replaced dialogue and disunity has replaced disarmament. States are seeking false security in stockpiling and spending hundreds of billions of dollars on doomsday weapons that have no place on our planet. Almost 13,000 nuclear weapons are now being held in arsenals around the world.\"\n\nHe said: \"We have been extraordinarily lucky so far. But luck is not a strategy.\"\n\nAnd the NPT, and the Review Conference is needed to \"hammer out the measures that will help avoid certain disaster and to put humanity on a path towards a world free of nuclear weapons ... eliminating nuclear weapons is the only guarantee they will not be used - we must work relentlessly towards this goal\".\n\nHe said the five priorities of the review conference were to:\n\nHe said \"future generations are counting on your commitment to step back from the abyss. We have a shared obligation to leave the world a better, safer place than we found it\".\n\nThe Tenth Review Conference is being held at the UN headquarters in New York and finishes on 26 August.", "source": {"uri": "world-nuclear-news.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Nuclear News (WNN)"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 33, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 45, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7139942044", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-04", "time": "17:34:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-04T17:34:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-04T17:32:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "url": "https://truthout.org/video/warnings-grow-over-nuclear-war-as-tensions-escalate-between-us-russia-and-china/", "title": "Warnings Grow over Nuclear War as Tensions Escalate Between US, Russia and China", "body": "The U.N. warned this week that humanity is \"one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation\" as tensions escalate globally.

Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nThe United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned this week humanity is, quote, \"one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation.\" He made the comments at the opening of a major U.N. gathering here in New York to review the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The meeting comes at a time when tensions are escalating between the United States and two other nuclear powers, Russia and China. This is part of Ant\u00f3nio Guterres's remarks.\n\nSECRETARY-GENERAL ANT\u00d3NIO GUTERRES: The clouds that parted following the end of the Cold War are gathering once more. We have been extraordinarily lucky so far. But luck is not a strategy, nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict. Today humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation. We need a treaty of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons as much as ever. And that is why this review conference is so important. It's an opportunity to hammer out the measures that will help avoid certain disaster and to put humanity on a new path towards a world free of nuclear weapons.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: During his speech, the U.N. secretary-general also announced plans to visit Hiroshima, Japan, this week. Seventy-seven years ago, on August 6, 1945, the United States dropped the world's first atomic bomb on the Japanese city, killing an estimated 140,000 people. [Three] days later, the United States dropped another atomic bomb on Nagasaki -- it was August 9th, 1945 -- where at least 74,000 people died.\n\nTo talk more about the threat of nuclear war, we're joined by two guests. Zia Mian is with us, physicist, nuclear expert and disarmament activist, co-director of the Program on Science and Global Security at Princeton University, co-author of Unmaking the Bomb: A Fissile Material Approach to Nuclear Disarmament and Nonproliferation. Dr. Ira Helfand is with us, as well, immediate past president of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, recipient of the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize, also co-founder and past president of Physicians for Social Responsibility, serves on the international steering group of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapon, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017. His new piece in The Hill is headlined \"Are Russia and NATO trying to wreck the NPT?\"\n\nDr. Ira Helfand, explain.\n\nDR. IRA HELFAND: Well, there have been multiple threats by Russia, and some threats by NATO, to use nuclear weapons in the context of the war in Ukraine. This is a totally unacceptable situation. And in response to that, my organization, the IPPNW, organized a statement with 17 other Nobel Peace laureates demanding that Russia and NATO make an explicit pledge that they would not use nuclear weapons under any circumstances in the context of this war. They've refused to do that.\n\nNow they're coming into the NPT meeting demanding, as they always do, that the countries which don't have nuclear weapons continue to refrain from obtaining them, while they themselves will not even promise not to blow up the world this week. And it's an extraordinarily hypocritical situation. And I think it is the kind of behavior which has put the NPT at risk.\n\nThe great powers try to blame the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. They try to identify that as a source of risk to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, because 121 countries around the world have come together and said that they will not -- they will honor their obligations under the NPT and not develop nuclear weapons. But the real threat to the NPT comes from the five permanent members of the Security Council -- the NATO members, the United States, the U.K. and France; Russia and China -- who are obliged under the NPT to enter into good-faith negotiations to eliminate their nuclear arsenals, and who have steadfastly refused for the last 50 years-plus to honor that obligation.\n\nAnd that's the problem that we're facing. And the behavior of NATO and Russia in the Ukraine conflict has just underlined this total failure of the permanent members of the Security Council to uphold their part of the bargain inherent in the Non-Proliferation Treaty. And I think that's what puts the treaty at risk.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: Dr. Zia Mian, could you comment on your concerns about what's going on at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which is, of course, the largest in Europe and one of the largest in the world?\n\nZIA MIAN: The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant -- I mean, as Shaun Burnie mentioned in your earlier segment, and as Ira also observed, nuclear plants were never designed, intended or imagined to be in war zones. They are dangerous enough even in peace time, given the history of nuclear accidents, complex technologies, institutional and human failures that we've seen throughout the history of all complex technologies. But what we've seen for more than 40 years now are attacks on nuclear power plants.\n\nIt's worth remembering, 40 years ago, Israel attacked a nuclear reactor in Iraq, and that was the first attack on a nuclear reactor by another state. And during the Iran-Iraq War, reactors were attacked. And the reactor in Dimona in Israel was also attacked. And now we see nuclear reactors being attacked by cyberattacks also.\n\nSo, I think what we have to ask is not so much the details of a specific reactor in Zaporizhzhia and the war in Ukraine, but the fact of: Can we feel safe in a world where these incredibly dangerous technologies coexist in a system where we can barely manage even ordinary technologies, never mind technologies with catastrophic failures, but ones in which states go to war and actually target not just cities and people, but also other kinds of industrial facilities, including nuclear reactors?\n\nAnd so, one of the things to keep in mind is that India and Pakistan long have lived with the threat of attacks on each other's nuclear facilities. And in 1988, they actually agreed a treaty between them to not attack each other's nuclear facilities, because of fears of the consequences of such attacks. And this may be the kind of thing that other states should also pick up on and ask the question -- until we can shut down all nuclear facilities safely and make sure that these problems can't recur in the future, at least we should have agreement not to attack them.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: Zia, now, you worked with your colleagues at Princeton earlier this year on a simulation looking at what might happen in the event of an escalation, how a conventional war between the U.S. and Russia could turn into a nuclear one. Could you talk about that simulation and what you found?\n\nZIA MIAN: So, several years ago, the Princeton Program on Science and Global Security tried to think about how to understand what would be the consequences of current U.S., NATO and Russian nuclear war plans, as far as we could understand them. And so, after thinking through what those war plans involved, using publicly open sources and what we know about the number and locations of U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons, the postures, the targets, we actually tried to then go through step by step of what would happen in a conventional war which escalated first with the use of one nuclear weapon on the battlefield to then retaliation to then escalation to a second stage of a larger use of nuclear weapons by both sides, then to all-out nuclear war and the consequences that would follow.\n\nAnd it found that, you know, within a matter of a few hours, there would be the better part of 100 million casualties. And the U.S. Strategic Command accepts publicly that all of their nuclear war exercises -- they are on record -- all of their nuclear war exercises end in all-out global thermonuclear war. So the war plans they have always end up with the end of the world. And so, that's what we were trying to explore, and that's what we were trying to explain.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And, Zia Mian, during the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference, France, the U.K. and the U.S. issued a statement saying, \"Nuclear weapons, for as long as they exist, should serve defensive purposes, deter aggression, and prevent war. We condemn those who would use or threaten to use nuclear weapons for military coercion, intimidation, and blackmail.\" Your response?\n\nZIA MIAN: This is basically the U.S., France and the U.K. saying, \"Our nuclear weapons are good. Your nuclear weapons are bad,\" even though, as we all know, the U.S. and the U.K. and France make nuclear threats. It's called nuclear deterrence. The very practice of nuclear deterrence is military coercion, intimidation and blackmail. It's just that when we do it, we call it deterrence; when they do it, you call it for what it is, which is coercion, intimidation and blackmail. And Daniel Ellsberg -- bless him -- pointed this out back in 1950s in a famous lecture on coercion and blackmail in the nuclear age, saying that nuclear weapons, fundamentally, except during times of active war, when they are exploded, are instruments for the threat of nuclear war. They are intended to be instruments of coercion, intimidation and blackmail. So, all I think we need to do is to accept the fact that for the first time these three weapon states have recognized at least the fact that nuclear weapons are about coercion, intimidation and blackmail. It's just the rest of us understand this applies to everybody's nuclear weapons.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Zia, finally, earlier this year, you attended the Vienna Conference of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Talk about the significance of that treaty, why it was formed to begin with, and what the substance of the discussions were.\n\nZIA MIAN: So, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is the first international treaty that bans nuclear weapons absolutely and unconditionally. And it also is the first and only treaty that bans the use, and even the threat of use, of nuclear weapons. If we had actually had the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in force with the U.S. and Russia and so on involved, there would have been no question of the threat of use of nuclear weapons by anybody. And the origins of this treaty go back to the beginning of the nuclear age. This was the first decision ever made by the United Nations in 1946. Before anything else, they said we need a plan for the elimination of nuclear weapons. What this treaty does, which entered into force in 2021, was to basically fulfill that first goal of the United Nations system. We now have an international legal instrument that bans nuclear weapons and bans the use and the threat of use of nuclear weapons.\n\nAnd in Vienna, the countries that came together as members of this treaty actually made a statement specifically talking about the threat and use of nuclear weapons as we see it today. And they said that this threat and use of nuclear weapons, including by Russia and by anyone under any circumstances, is a violation of international law, is a violation of the U.N. Charter, and should be condemned explicitly and implicitly and irrespective of the circumstances. So, you couldn't ask for a clearer statement against the threat of nuclear weapons -- unlike the kind of statement that we saw that you asked about from France, the U.K. and the U.S., which says, \"Our nuclear threats are OK. Everybody else's threats are bad.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And finally, Dr. Helfand, the U.N. secretary-general heads to Hiroshima for the 77th anniversary of the U.S. dropping the first atomic bomb in the world on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, followed by the dropping of the second bomb on Nagasaki on August 9th, '45. If you could comment on his comment saying we are closer to nuclear annihilation than ever? He'll be meeting with hibakusha -- that's Hiroshima bomb survivors -- and young activists. And also, whether you think what's happening with the increased tensions with Ukraine, Russia and China are -- and now bringing Finland and Sweden into NATO, are escalating tension?\n\nDR. IRA HELFAND: Well, I think the tensions clearly are escalating, and we are closer to nuclear war than we've ever been. And we need to recognize that. You know, the song that you played earlier in the show, \"You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction,\" that's the problem. We don't believe it, because it is such a horrible reality that we're confronting. But we better start believing it, because it's true.\n\nFortunately, we have to also understand this is not the future that needs to be. There's nothing that makes nuclear destruction inevitable. It's not as though, you know, we're dealing with some force of nature that we have no control over. We know how to take these weapons apart. And we need to do that.\n\nAnd -- excuse me -- here in the United States, we've launched a national campaign called Back from the Brink to try to force the United States government to change its nuclear policy in a fundamental way, to recognize that nuclear weapons do not make the world secure, they are the greatest threat to security, and they need to be eliminated, and to get the United States to play the role which it should, initiating negotiations with the other nuclear-armed states for the specific verifiable, enforceable, time-bound agreement, so they will come to eliminate their weapons, so they will meet their obligations under Article 6 of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and meet their obligations under the new Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\n\nAnd at the current session at the NPT in New York, I think it's incredibly important that the non-nuclear weapon states hold the permanent members of the Security Council accountable, that they demand that NATO and Russia in fact issue a statement pledging they will not use nuclear weapons in the context of the war in Ukraine, and they go beyond that and demand that all five members of the Security Council's P5, the permanent members, begin now, during this meeting in New York, the negotiations to eliminate their nuclear weapons, as they have promised to do for 50 years, and that they bring in the other four nuclear-armed states into that process. And that can happen. This is not some fantasy. This is, practically, what needs to happen if we are going to survive.\n\nAnd the leaders of the great powers -- Biden, Xi and Putin -- need to sit down with themselves and recognize the fact that the policies they are pursuing are going to lead to the end of the world that we know. They're playing this game of chicken, this game of king of the mountain, to see who's going to come out on top of this struggle for power and wealth in the world. And they don't seem to understand that while there may be a winner, the mountain that that person ends up sitting on is going to be an ash heap, what's left of our civilization, because they're going to be destroying it. And they need a totally different approach. They need to understand that to deal with the nuclear threat, to do with the climate crisis, to deal with the future pandemics that we will experience, they need to cooperate. They need to work together, or else none of us are going to survive.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Dr. Ira Helfand, we thank you for being with us, immediate past president of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, Nobel Prize-winning organization.

It means finding practical measures that will reduce the risk of nuclear war and put the world back on the path to disarmament. There is a need to strengthen all avenues of dialogue and transparency as peace cannot take hold in an absence of trust and mutual respect, he said.\n\nThe second area is to further reduce the risk of nuclear war, he said.\n\n\"Eliminating nuclear weapons is the only guarantee they will never be used. We must work relentlessly toward this goal. This must start with new commitments to shrink the numbers of all kinds of nuclear weapons so that they no longer hang by a thread over humanity. And it means reinvigorating -- and fully resourcing -- our multilateral agreements and frameworks around disarmament and non-proliferation, including the important work of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\"\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres speaks at the opening of the 10th Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference at UN Headquarters in New York on Aug. 1, 2022. (Loey Felipe/UN Photo/Handout via Xinhua)\n\nThe third area is to address the simmering tensions in the Middle East and Asia, said Guterres.\n\nBy adding the threat of nuclear weapons to enduring conflicts, these regions are edging toward catastrophe. There is a need to redouble support for dialogue and negotiation to ease tensions and forge new bonds of trust in regions that have seen too little, he said.\n\nThe fourth area is to promote the peaceful use of nuclear technology as a catalyst to advance the Sustainable Development Goals, including for medical and other uses, he said.\n\nThe fifth area is to fulfill all outstanding commitments in the NPT itself, and keep it fit for purpose in these trying times, he said.\n\n\"We are all here today because we believe in the treaty's purpose and function. But carrying it into the future requires going beyond the status quo. It requires renewed commitment, and real, good-faith negotiations. And it requires all parties to listen, compromise and keep the lessons of the past -- and the fragility of the future -- in view at all times.\"\n\nThe 10th NPT Review Conference, which was originally scheduled for April-May 2020, had to be postponed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. NPT Review Conferences had been held every five years since 1975.\n\nThe 10th Review Conference has been long-delayed. But its importance and urgency remain undiminished. It takes place at a critical juncture for collective peace and security, said Guterres.\n\nThe 10th NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty) Review Conference is held at the UN Headquarters in New York on Aug. 1, 2022. (Loey Felipe/UN Photo/Handout via Xinhua)\n\nThe climate crisis, stark inequalities, conflicts and human rights violations, and the personal and economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have put the world under greater stress than it has faced in our lifetimes. And the Review Conference occurs at a time of nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War, he said.\n\nThe initial post-Cold War period ushered in a tentative new hope for peace: a hope found in massive arsenal reductions, in entire regions declaring themselves to be free of nuclear weapons, and in the entrenchment of norms against the use, proliferation and testing of nuclear weapons. And through a combination of commitment, judgment and luck, the world avoided the suicidal mistake of nuclear conflict. But as the years have passed, these fruits of hope are withering, he warned.\n\n\"Humanity is in danger of forgetting the lessons forged in the terrifying fires of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Geopolitical tensions are reaching new highs. Competition is trumping cooperation and collaboration. Distrust has replaced dialogue and disunity has replaced disarmament. States are seeking false security in stockpiling and spending hundreds of billions of dollars on doomsday weapons that have no place on our planet. Almost 13,000 nuclear weapons are now being held in arsenals around the world,\" he said.\n\nAll these are happening at a time when the risks of proliferation are growing and guardrails to prevent escalation are weakening, and when crises -- with nuclear undertones -- are festering, from the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula to the conflict in Ukraine and to many other factors around the world, he noted.\n\n\"The clouds that parted following the end of the Cold War are gathering once more. We have been extraordinarily lucky so far. But luck is not a strategy, nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict. Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,\" warned the UN chief.\n\n\"We need the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as much as ever. That is why this Review Conference is so important. It's an opportunity to hammer out the measures that will help avoid certain disaster and to put humanity on a new path toward a world free of nuclear weapons. It's also a chance to strengthen this treaty and make it fit for the worrying world around us,\" said Guterres. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 8, "stanza_neu": 44, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 54, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7140717210", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-05", "time": "09:43:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-05T09:43:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-05T09:41:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "url": "https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/475385/Diplomat-says-Iran-to-cease-remedial-acts-if-US-makes-right", "title": "Diplomat says Iran to cease remedial acts if US makes 'right decision'", "body": "TEHRAN - Iran's ambassador to the United Nations has said that Tehran will cease its remedial measures if Washington makes the \"right decision\" and return to the 2015 nuclear agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\n\n\"When the U.S. makes the right decision, Iran, in turn, will cease its remedial actions and resume the full implementation of its nuclear-related measures in accordance with the 2015 agreement,\" Majid Takht Ravanchi told the NPT Review Conference in New York on Wednesday.\n\nOne year after the U.S. quit the JCPOA, Iran started to gradually lift ban on its nuclear activities. Iran did this as the European sides party to the JCPOA failed to compensate Iran for the U.S. sanctions\n\nThe ambassador also said Iran has held talks \"in good-will\" since April 2021 to resurrect the JCPOA.\n\nIran, the remaining members of the JCPOA and the U.S. started talks in Vienna on Thursday with the hope of putting the JCPOA on the right track.\n\nFollowing is the text of the ambassador's remarks at the NPT meeting:\n\nThis Review Conference provides an opportunity to scrutinize the Non-Proliferation Treaty's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nNPT consists of three pillars, namely, disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful use. Under Article VI of the NPT, nuclear-weapon States have explicitly committed to negotiating to achieve nuclear disarmament. In the 2000 NPT Review Conference, nuclear-weapon States agreed to \"13 Practical Steps\" to implement Article VI, which included in Step 6 \"an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament.\" In the \"2010 Action Plan\", nuclear-weapon States committed to reducing and ultimately eliminating all types of their nuclear weapons. However, half a century after entry into force of the NPT, there are still thousands of nuclear weapons, deployed and stocked, hundreds of billions of dollars spent to replace and upgrade nuclear arsenals, and a quantitative and qualitative nuclear arms race is taking place.\n\nSince the last Review Conference in 2015, no negotiation has begun among nuclear-weapon States on the reduction or elimination of their nuclear weapons and no new reduction in nuclear forces has occurred.\n\nThis frustrating status in nuclear disarmament emanates from the blatant non-compliance of nuclear-weapon States with their legal obligations under Article VI of the Treaty. The existence of this legal obligation was affirmed by the International Court of Justice in 1996. It appears from the actions and policies of certain nuclear-weapon States that, in practice, they have put aside their nuclear disarmament obligations.\n\nFor instance, the United States has recently increased the role and number of its nuclear weapons and this modernization costs around $1.2 trillion. The United Kingdom has announced its intention to develop and build 80 new nuclear warheads. France is spending billions of euros to gradually augment and upgrade its nuclear weapons and their launch platforms.\n\nWe believe that this crisis has seriously undermined confidence in the Treaty. Let's not forget that the NPT strikes a delicate balance between disarmament, nonproliferation, and peaceful use. Article VI is the central part of the bargain on which the NPT is based, i.e., nonproliferation in exchange for nuclear disarmament. It will not be possible to indefinitely maintain the current unbalanced implementation of the NPT.\n\nThe proposals to manage the nuclear risks instead of nuclear disarmament, in our view, seek to legitimize, maintain and manage the status quo. The top priority and objective of this Review Conference should be to define a path forward to change the status quo and eliminate the risks of nuclear weapons. The urgent commencement of negotiations on a comprehensive convention on nuclear weapons leading to their total elimination within a specified timeframe will provide a real path to change the status quo.\n\nThe non-nuclear-weapon States are adhering to their nonproliferation undertakings, except for a few European Parties including Germany which hosts many nuclear weapons in their territory in breach of the spirit and letter of the Treaty.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran as a steadfast supporter of nuclear disarmament is equally committed to nuclear nonproliferation. We support the non-discriminatory and impartial implementation of the safeguards system by the IAEA. It is crucial that the IAEA should carry out its professional duties free from interference by third parties, particularly the intelligence services that provide unsubstantiated allegations.\n\nNon-proliferation provisions should be applied globally and without exception. Unfortunately, as a result of the application of double standards in enforcing non-proliferation provisions, the Zionist regime's nuclear weapons, developed with the support and assistance of the U.S., continue to pose a serious threat to the security of Middle Eastern States Parties to the Treaty. Since its inception, this regime has committed all international core crimes, including aggression against all its neighbors, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and occupation of the territories of several neighboring countries.\n\nThis terrorist regime has assassinated several innocent nuclear scientists and has, time and again, threatened to attack safeguarded peaceful nuclear facilities of my country. In addition to condemnation of such threat to use force, States Parties need to take appropriate deterrent action against this law-breaking regime. If this regime commits such foolish aggression, it will pay a heavy price. Furthermore, the supreme interests of our country, as a state party to the Treaty, will be jeopardized. The Review Conference should promptly address this threat of Israeli regime.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran strongly supports the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and expresses its deep concern over the long delay in the implementation of the 1995 Resolution and the 2010 Plan of Action on the Middle East.\n\nBefore concluding, I would like to make a few points regarding the nuclear negotiations. While Iran was implementing its nuclear commitments under the nuclear deal as certified by the 15 IAEA reports, the U.S. withdrew from it in May 2018 and subsequently re-imposed U.S. sanctions on Iran and launched a maximum pressure campaign against Iran to prevent Iran's enjoyment of the economic benefits promised in the agreement. The Islamic Republic of Iran acted responsibly and with strategic patience and maximum resistance preserved the agreement. Since April 2021, Iran has negotiated in good-will with other participants for resuming the full implementation of the deal. Achieving this objective has been delayed because the United States is yet to decide to give assurance that Iran will enjoy the promised economic benefits in the agreement. When the U.S. makes the right decision, Iran, in turn, will cease its remedial actions and resume the full implementation of its nuclear-related measures in accordance with the 2015 agreement.", "source": {"uri": "tehrantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tehran Times"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://media.mehrnews.com/d/2022/08/04/4/4235650.jpg?ts=1659587614393", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 9, "stanza_neu": 33, "stanza_pos": 4, "swn_neg": 46, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7138545819", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-03", "time": "16:38:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-03T16:38:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-03T16:38:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "url": "https://www.oann.com/secy-blinken-no-place-in-the-world-for-nuclear-tensions/", "title": "Secy.

Blinken condemned Iran's advances in uranium enrichment, North Korea's increasing nuclear missile tests and Russia's bombing campaign in Ukraine.\n\nDuring his speech, the US official noted the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, which sparked new discussions on nuclear deterrence. The Secretary stated that upholding the values of the NPT resulted in Ukraine giving up its nuclear arms in 1994. He claimed those values could have long lasting implications for smaller countries facing threats from bigger adversaries.\n\nAdditionally, Blinken urged nuclear powers to wield their power and responsibility. He also advised members to uphold the NPT's three pillars: non-proliferation, disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\n\nHe contended that President Biden has been aggressive in his efforts to promote disarmament by renewing the US-Russia New START Treaty until 2026. This treaty between the two countries advocates for other countries to rollback their nuclear ambitions and not by threatening others with America's nuclear weapons.\n\nThe Secretary promised that under American leadership, the world must ensure no nuclear bomb should ever be deployed.

It means finding practical measures that will reduce the risk of nuclear war and put the world back on the path to disarmament. There is a need to strengthen all avenues of dialogue and transparency as peace cannot take hold in an absence of trust and mutual respect,\" he said.\n\nThe second area is to further reduce the risk of nuclear war, he said.\n\n\"Eliminating nuclear weapons is the only guarantee they will never be used. We must work relentlessly toward this goal. This must start with new commitments to shrink the numbers of all kinds of nuclear weapons so that they no longer hang by a thread over humanity. And it means reinvigorating -- and fully resourcing -- our multilateral agreements and frameworks around disarmament and non-proliferation, including the important work of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\"\n\nThe third area is to address the simmering tensions in the Middle East and Asia, said Guterres.\n\nBy adding the threat of nuclear weapons to enduring conflicts, these regions are edging toward catastrophe. There is a need to redouble support for dialogue and negotiation to ease tensions and forge new bonds of trust in regions that have seen too little, he said.\n\nThe fourth area is to promote the peaceful use of nuclear technology as a catalyst to advance the Sustainable Development Goals, including for medical and other uses, he said.\n\nThe fifth area is to fulfill all outstanding commitments in the NPT itself, and keep it fit for purpose in these trying times, he said.\n\n\"We are all here today because we believe in the treaty's purpose and function. But carrying it into the future requires going beyond the status quo. It requires renewed commitment, and real, good-faith negotiations. And it requires all parties to listen, compromise and keep the lessons of the past -- and the fragility of the future -- in view at all times.\"\n\nThe 10th NPT Review Conference, which was originally scheduled for April-May 2020, had to be postponed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. NPT Review Conferences had been held every five years since 1975.\n\nThe 10th Review Conference has been long-delayed. But its importance and urgency remain undiminished. It takes place at a critical juncture for collective peace and security, said Guterres.\n\nThe climate crisis, stark inequalities, conflicts and human rights violations, and the personal and economic devastation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic have put the world under greater stress than it has faced in our lifetimes. And the Review Conference occurs at a time of nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War, he said.\n\nThe initial post-Cold War period ushered in a tentative new hope for peace a hope found in massive arsenal reductions, in entire regions declaring themselves to be free of nuclear weapons, and in the entrenchment of norms against the use, proliferation and testing of nuclear weapons. And through a combination of commitment, judgment and luck, the world avoided the suicidal mistake of nuclear conflict. But as the years have passed, these fruits of hope are withering, he warned.\n\n\"Humanity is in danger of forgetting the lessons forged in the terrifying fires of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Geopolitical tensions are reaching new highs. Competition is trumping cooperation and collaboration. Distrust has replaced dialogue and disunity has replaced disarmament. States are seeking false security in stockpiling and spending hundreds of billions of dollars on doomsday weapons that have no place on our planet. Almost 13,000 nuclear weapons are now being held in arsenals around the world,\" he said.\n\nAll these are happening at a time when the risks of proliferation are growing and guardrails to prevent escalation are weakening, and when crises -- with nuclear undertones -- are festering, from the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula to the conflict in Ukraine and to many other factors around the world, he noted.\n\n\"The clouds that parted following the end of the Cold War are gathering once more. We have been extraordinarily lucky so far. But luck is not a strategy, nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict. Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,\" warned the UN chief.\n\n\"We need the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as much as ever. That is why this Review Conference is so important. It's an opportunity to hammer out the measures that will help avoid certain disaster and to put humanity on a new path toward a world free of nuclear weapons. It's also a chance to strengthen this treaty and make it fit for the worrying world around us,\" said Guterres.\n\n(IANS | Posted on 02 August 2022, 1659519687 162O158O129O38)", "source": {"uri":

As the envoy announced, Islamic Republic has held talks \"in good-will\" since April 2021.\n\nBelow is the full text of the ambassador remarks:\n\nIn the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful\n\nMr. President,\n\nI congratulate you on your election as the President of this important conference. My delegation aligns itself with the NAM statement delivered by Azerbaijan.\n\nThis Review Conference provides an opportunity to scrutinize the Non-Proliferation Treaty's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nNPT consists of three pillars, namely, disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful use. Under Article VI of the NPT, nuclear-weapon States have explicitly committed to negotiating to achieve nuclear disarmament. In the 2000 NPT Review Conference, nuclear-weapon States agreed to \"13 Practical Steps\" to implement Article VI, which included in Step 6 \"an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament.\" In the \"2010 Action Plan\", nuclear-weapon States committed to reducing and ultimately eliminating all types of their nuclear weapons. However, half a century after entry into force of the NPT, there are still thousands of nuclear weapons, deployed and stocked, hundreds of billions of dollars spent to replace and upgrade nuclear arsenals, and a quantitative and qualitative nuclear arms race is taking place.\n\nSince the last Review Conference in 2015, no negotiation has begun among nuclear-weapon States on the reduction or elimination of their nuclear weapons and no new reduction in nuclear forces has occurred.\n\nThis frustrating status in nuclear disarmament emanates from the blatant non-compliance of nuclear-weapon States with their legal obligations under Article VI of the Treaty. The existence of this legal obligation was affirmed by the International Court of Justice in 1996. It appears from the actions and policies of certain nuclear-weapon States that, in practice, they have put aside their nuclear disarmament obligations.\n\nFor instance, the United States has recently increased the role and number of its nuclear weapons and this modernization costs around $1.2 trillion. The United Kingdom has announced its intention to develop and build 80 new nuclear warheads. France is spending billions of euros to gradually augment and upgrade its nuclear weapons and their launch platforms.\n\nWe believe that this crisis has seriously undermined confidence in the Treaty. Let's not forget that the NPT strikes a delicate balance between disarmament, nonproliferation, and peaceful use. Article VI is the central part of the bargain on which the NPT is based, i.e., nonproliferation in exchange for nuclear disarmament. It will not be possible to indefinitely maintain the current unbalanced implementation of the NPT.\n\nThe proposals to manage the nuclear risks instead of nuclear disarmament, in our view, seek to legitimize, maintain and manage the status quo. The top priority and objective of this Review Conference should be to define a path forward to change the status quo and eliminate the risks of nuclear weapons. The urgent commencement of negotiations on a comprehensive convention on nuclear weapons leading to their total elimination within a specified timeframe will provide a real path to change the status quo.\n\nMr. President, ladies, and gentlemen,\n\nThe non-nuclear-weapon States are adhering to their nonproliferation undertakings, except for a few European Parties including Germany which host many nuclear weapons in their territory in breach of the spirit and letter of the Treaty.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran as a steadfast supporter of nuclear disarmament is equally committed to nuclear nonproliferation. We support the non-discriminatory and impartial implementation of the safeguards system by the IAEA. It is crucial that the IAEA should carry out its professional duties free from interference by third parties, particularly the intelligence services that provide unsubstantiated allegations.\n\nNon-proliferation provisions should be applied globally and without exception. Unfortunately, as a result of the application of double standards in enforcing non-proliferation provisions, the Zionist regime's nuclear weapons, developed with the support and assistance of the US, continue to pose a serious threat to the security of Middle Eastern States Parties to the Treaty. Since its inception, this regime has committed all international core crimes, including aggression against all its neighbors, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and occupation of the territories of several neighboring countries.\n\nThis terrorist regime has assassinated several innocent nuclear scientists and has, time and again, threatened to attack safeguarded peaceful nuclear facilities of my country. In addition to condemnation of such threat to use force, States Parties need to take appropriate deterrent action against this law-breaking regime. If this regime commits such foolish aggression, it will pay a heavy price. Furthermore, the supreme interests of our country, as a state party to the Treaty, will be jeopardized. The Review Conference should promptly address this threat of Israeli regime.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran strongly supports the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and expresses its deep concern over the long delay in the implementation of the 1995 Resolution and the 2010 Plan of Action on the Middle East.\n\nBefore concluding, I would like to make a few points regarding the nuclear negotiations. While Iran was implementing its nuclear commitments under the nuclear deal as certified by the 15 IAEA reports, the US withdrew from it in May 2018 and subsequently re-imposed US sanctions on Iran and launched a maximum pressure campaign against Iran to prevent Iran's enjoyment of the economic benefits promised in the agreement. The Islamic Republic of Iran acted responsibly and with strategic patience and maximum resistance preserved the agreement. Since April 2021, Iran has negotiated in good-will with other participants for resuming the full implementation of the deal. Achieving this objective has been delayed because the United States is yet to decide to give assurance that Iran will enjoy the promised economic benefits in the agreement. When the US makes the right decision, Iran, in turn, will cease its remedial actions and resume the full implementation of its nuclear-related measures in accordance with the 2015 agreement.", "source": {"uri": "ifpnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Iran Front Page"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://ifpnews.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rank_math_overlay_thumb&id=235076&type=iran-front-page&secret=4b0e7fee9267a0719199433e4da3fc0f", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 9, "stanza_neu": 36, "stanza_pos": 4, "swn_neg": 49, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7139657639", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-04", "time": "13:30:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-04T13:30:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-04T13:29:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/reducing-the-risk-of-a-nuclear-war-101659619676364.html", "title": "Reducing the risk of a nuclear war", "body": "Every year, August 6 is observed as Hiroshima Day to recall the apocalyptic destruction rained on the Japanese city by the United States (US) in 1945, followed by a similar nuclear weapon attack on Nagasaki three days later. The attack marked the end of World War II. While the world has managed to avoid a similar use of nuclear weapons for 77 years and renews this pledge annually, the occasion this year is fraught with deep anxiety given the prevailing global geopolitical turbulence and a disturbing absence of sagacious leadership.\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in February and the manner in which Moscow invoked its nuclear capability to warn the US resurrected memories of the first phase of the Cold War when the two adversaries engaged in sabre rattling. The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis introduced a degree of sobriety and restraint about the consequences of taking recourse to nuclear weapons. Subsequently, the nuclear club expanded to five nations, with China joining the US, the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the United Kingdom, and France.\n\nBy 1968, this club became an exclusive one. In a rare display of realpolitik solidarity, the two former superpowers, the US and USSR, crafted the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). It effectively divided the world into the five nuclear weapon haves -- and disarmed the unarmed into permanent nuclear have-nots.\n\nIn short, through NPT, the five nuclear weapon powers, who are also the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, accorded to themselves the responsibility of maintaining global nuclear stability -- but in 2022, they have muddied the sanctity of nuclear deterrence. This trend has been exacerbated further by the most recent US-China tensions over Taiwan, wherein Beijing has issued a dire warning. In the end-July phone call between US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart President Xi Jinping, the latter is reported to have warned the White House occupant that \"those who play with fire will perish by it\" and added ominously, \"it is hoped that the US will be clear-eyed about this.\" This warning was conveyed to Washington before the US House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan (August 3). Beijing's response to the visit is being monitored carefully.\n\nThe stalled Iranian nuclear deal and periodic threats by North Korea about using its nascent weapons of mass destruction capability against the US and its regional allies add to the discord. Suffice it to note that 2022 is a blighted year in relation to the global nuclear challenge.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the 10th Review Conference (RevCon) of NPT began in New York on August 1. The event was scheduled for 2020 but postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In a symbolic gesture, Japanese Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, addressed the conference and made a powerful and poignant plea when he noted: \"As a Prime Minister from Hiroshima, I believe that we must take every realistic measure towards a world without nuclear weapons step by step, however difficult the path may be.\"\n\nNPT has an uneven track record. It has succeeded in controlling horizontal proliferation, but has tacitly enabled a vertical expansion of the global nuclear arsenal among the privileged five. Currently, NPT has near-universal membership, but a few States have chosen to be non-signatories, and four have acquired nuclear weapon capability of varying characteristics. They include India, Pakistan, and North Korea, which have overtly demonstrated their ability, while Israel has an opaque covert status.\n\nNuclear weapons States are reluctant to give up their capability and move towards universal disarmament -- global zero being the Holy Grail -- and for decades, NPT was the only show in town. However, over the last five years, there has been a concerted attempt by the nuclear have-nots to prod the nuclear weapons States, and this has resulted in a counter treaty, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). Introduced in September 2017, it became effective in January 2021 and has 86 state signatories, including Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, South Africa, New Zealand, and Ireland, among others.\n\nTPNW is the first legally binding international agreement to comprehensively prohibit nuclear weapons, with the ultimate goal being their total elimination. However Utopian it may seem, the objective is commendable. It is similar to India's earnest attempt at the UN in 1988, under what is referred to as the Rajiv Gandhi action plan, and one can only hope that it will not flounder similarly.\n\nWhile nuclear weapons cannot be easily wished away, the concept of pristine deterrence or the core mission of the nuclear weapon has to be acknowledged anew by the nuclear haves. The dreaded nuke in its early avatar was expected to have only one role -- to \"deter\" the potential use of such capability by an adversary.\n\nSome valuable reports and recommendations have been made over the last decade by different entities -- State and non-State -- and they all have similar advocacy: A commitment to nuclear weapon restraint and a solemn compact not to use this fearsome capability.\n\nPM Kishida introduced a practical \"Hiroshima Action Plan\" in New York, which envisages five tracks for collective action to reduce global nuclear risks. Japan's $10 million support to the UN to create a \"Youth Leader Fund for a world without nuclear weapons\" is particularly welcome.\n\nFurther, Kishida will convene the first meeting of an international group of eminent persons on November 23 in that resolute city , Hiroshima , which stands as a beacon of an exigency that must never occur again.\n\nLet Nagasaki be the last time.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/08/04/1600x900/b08aee70-13f4-11ed-865b-9917e61c1d8b_1659619628836.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 26, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 36, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7136691618", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "09:28:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T09:28:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T09:27:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "url": "https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/there-can-be-no-winners-russian-president-vladimir-putin-denounces-nuclear-war-in-letter-to-treaty/news-story/6d5cbf4a40b59aa6789e5250b6261f04", "title": "Putin warns against a nuclear war", "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin says there are \"no winners\" in a nuclear war and that no such conflict should ever be waged.\n\nHe made the remarks in a letter to participants of a conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) more than five months into Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"We proceed from the fact that there can be no winners in a nuclear war and it should never be unleashed, and we stand for equal and indivisible security for all members of the world community,\" Mr Putin wrote.\n\nThe comments are in stark contrast to previous statements made by the Kremlin regarding the use of Russia's nuclear capability.\n\nStream more global news with Flash. 25+ news channels in 1 place.

Three days later, on August 9, 1945, it dropped another bomb on Nagasaki, killing nearly 74,000 people. On August 15, the same year, Japan surrendered to the allies, ending World War 2.\n\nFour years later, in 1949, the Soviet Union tested its first nuclear bomb. The UK followed it in 1952, France in 1960 and China in 1964.\n\nSince the end of World War, the world has come close to seeing another nuclear attack several times. The most serious among these was the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, when the US and the Soviet Union confronted each other in a 13-day intense political and military standoff.\n\nWhat is the state of nuclear weapons today?\n\nIn 2022, nine countries possess over 13,000 nuclear warheads. However, the exact number of these bombs is difficult to know as it is kept confidential by the governments.\n\nAccording to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), Russia has 6,255 nuclear warheads, the highest in the world. It is followed by the US with 5,550 such bombs. And China comes in a distant third place with 350 nuclear warheads. The US and Russia combined own nearly 90 per cent of the world's nuclear weapons.\n\nOther countries that possess or claim to possess nuclear bombs are France, the UK, Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea (Chart 1).\n\nFive other nations host America's nuclear warheads. These are Turkey, Italy, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. Turkey holds 50, the highest number of warheads on the list.\n\nThe list, however, does not end here. Twenty-seven countries endorse the use of nuclear weapons on their behalf by North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO). Australia, Belgium, Canada, Japan, South Korea and Spain are among these 27 countries.\n\nBelarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine received nuclear warheads from the Soviet Union after it was dismantled in 1991. However, they returned the warheads to Russia after joining the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1994.\n\nWhat efforts are being taken to prevent a nuclear war?\n\nThe world saw the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with fear and dread. Soon after the war ended, countries came together to stop countries from using nuclear weapons. The most significant treaty in this regard is the NPT.\n\nIn 1968, the NPT opened for signatures and was implemented in 1970. On May 11, 1995, it was extended indefinitely. According to the latest data from the United Nations website, the treaty currently has 191 (190 excluding North Korea) members, including five nuclear nations. Only India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea (uncertain) have not signed the treaty.\n\nNorth Korea's membership remains uncertain as it quit the treaty in 2003, but the member states have not accepted it.\n\nNPT aims to \"prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament,\" according to the UN.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspects the countries for compliance with the treaty.\n\nIn 1996, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) opened for signatures. It aims to prevent countries from conducting any nuclear test or explosion.\n\nOne hundred eighty-five countries have signed the treaty so far, and 172 have ratified it.

My delegation aligns itself with the NAM statement delivered by Azerbaijan.\n\nThis Review Conference provides an opportunity to scrutinize the Non-Proliferation Treaty's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nNPT consists of three pillars, namely, disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful use. Under Article VI of the NPT, nuclear-weapon States have explicitly committed to negotiating to achieve nuclear disarmament. In the 2000 NPT Review Conference, nuclear-weapon States agreed to \"13 Practical Steps\" to implement Article VI, which included in Step 6 \"an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament.\" In the \"2010 Action Plan\", nuclear-weapon States committed to reducing and ultimately eliminating all types of their nuclear weapons. However, half a century after entry into force of the NPT, there are still thousands of nuclear weapons, deployed and stocked, hundreds of billions of dollars spent to replace and upgrade nuclear arsenals, and a quantitative and qualitative nuclear arms race is taking place.\n\nSince the last Review Conference in 2015, no negotiation has begun among nuclear-weapon States on the reduction or elimination of their nuclear weapons and no new reduction in nuclear forces has occurred.\n\nThis frustrating status in nuclear disarmament emanates from the blatant non-compliance of nuclear-weapon States with their legal obligations under Article VI of the Treaty. The existence of this legal obligation was affirmed by the International Court of Justice in 1996. It appears from the actions and policies of certain nuclear-weapon States that, in practice, they have put aside their nuclear disarmament obligations.\n\nFor instance, the United States has recently increased the role and number of its nuclear weapons and this modernization costs around $1.2 trillion. The United Kingdom has announced its intention to develop and build 80 new nuclear warheads. France is spending billions of euros to gradually augment and upgrade its nuclear weapons and their launch platforms.\n\nWe believe that this crisis has seriously undermined confidence in the Treaty. Let's not forget that the NPT strikes a delicate balance between disarmament, nonproliferation, and peaceful use. Article VI is the central part of the bargain on which the NPT is based, i.e., nonproliferation in exchange for nuclear disarmament. It will not be possible to indefinitely maintain the current unbalanced implementation of the NPT.\n\nThe proposals to manage the nuclear risks instead of nuclear disarmament, in our view, seek to legitimize, maintain and manage the status quo. The top priority and objective of this Review Conference should be to define a path forward to change the status quo and eliminate the risks of nuclear weapons. The urgent commencement of negotiations on a comprehensive convention on nuclear weapons leading to their total elimination within a specified timeframe will provide a real path to change the status quo.\n\nMr. President, ladies, and gentlemen,\n\nThe non-nuclear-weapon States are adhering to their nonproliferation undertakings, except for a few European Parties including Germany which host many nuclear weapons in their territory in breach of the spirit and letter of the Treaty.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran as a steadfast supporter of nuclear disarmament is equally committed to nuclear nonproliferation. We support the non-discriminatory and impartial implementation of the safeguards system by the IAEA. It is crucial that the IAEA should carry out its professional duties free from interference by third parties, particularly the intelligence services that provide unsubstantiated allegations.\n\nNon-proliferation provisions should be applied globally and without exception. Unfortunately, as a result of the application of double standards in enforcing non-proliferation provisions, the Zionist regime's nuclear weapons, developed with the support and assistance of the U.S., continue to pose a serious threat to the security of Middle Eastern States Parties to the Treaty. Since its inception, this regime has committed all international core crimes, including aggression against all its neighbors, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and occupation of the territories of several neighboring countries.\n\nThis terrorist regime has assassinated several innocent nuclear scientists and has, time and again, threatened to attack safeguarded peaceful nuclear facilities of my country. In addition to condemnation of such threat to use force, States Parties need to take appropriate deterrent action against this law-breaking regime. If this regime commits such foolish aggression, it will pay a heavy price. Furthermore, the supreme interests of our country, as a state party to the Treaty, will be jeopardized. The Review Conference should promptly address this threat of Israeli regime.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran strongly supports the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and expresses its deep concern over the long delay in the implementation of the 1995 Resolution and the 2010 Plan of Action on the Middle East.\n\nBefore concluding, I would like to make a few points regarding the nuclear negotiations. While Iran was implementing its nuclear commitments under the nuclear deal as certified by the 15 IAEA reports, the U.S. withdrew from it in May 2018 and subsequently re-imposed U.S. sanctions on Iran and launched a maximum pressure campaign against Iran to prevent Iran's enjoyment of the economic benefits promised in the agreement. The Islamic Republic of Iran acted responsibly and with strategic patience and maximum resistance preserved the agreement. Since April 2021, Iran has negotiated in good-will with other participants for resuming the full implementation of the deal. Achieving this objective has been delayed because the United States is yet to decide to give assurance that Iran will enjoy the promised economic benefits in the agreement. When the U.S. makes the right decision, Iran, in turn, will cease its remedial actions and resume the full implementation of its nuclear-related measures in accordance with the 2015 agreement.\n\nI thank you, Mr. President.\n\n1483**7129", "source": {"uri": "en.irna.ir", "dataType": "news", "title": "IRNA English"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://img9.irna.ir/d/r2/2022/08/04/4/169835459.jpg?ts=1659587133095", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 9, "stanza_neu": 38, "stanza_pos": 4, "swn_neg": 51, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7136838081", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "11:30:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T11:30:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T10:53:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "url": "https://www.newser.com/story/323660/un-chief-warns-nuclear-danger-is-real.html", "title": "UN Chief: We're a Step Away From 'Nuclear Annihilation'", "body": "(Newser) - The United Nations chief warned the world Monday that \"humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation.\" Secretary-General Antonio Guterres gave the dire warning at the opening of the long-delayed high-level meeting to review the landmark 50-year-old treaty aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and eventually achieving a nuclear-free world, per the AP.

Kazakhstan became a member state of the NPT in 1993.\n\nThe Kazakh delegation, led by Rakhmetullin, attended the review conference along with 133 state representatives and non-governmental organizations. The conference takes place in New York from Aug. 1 to 26.\n\nAccording to Rakhmetullin, Kazakhstan strictly follows the three pillars of the treaty, which are nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation, and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. Having experienced the detrimental consequences of nuclear tests, Kazakhstan urges other states to maintain strict compliance with all these \"cornerstone principles of the NPT,\" said Rakhmetullin.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said that the world \"needs the NPT as much as ever,\" according to a UN press release.\n\nHe stressed that geopolitical tensions around the world make states \"seek false security in stockpiling,\" which on the contrary, increases instability. With around 13,000 nuclear weapons held in arsenals around the world, \"humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,\" said Guterres.\n\nIn this regard, Rakhmetullin on behalf of the Central Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone (CANWFZ) states that include Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, encouraged the conference participants to support efforts to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones in other regions of the world.\n\nKazakhstan is committed to strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime during the country's chairmanship on the First Committee that deals with disarmament, global challenges and threats to peace during the upcoming 77th session of the UN General Assembly.\n\nRakhmetullin also reiterated that Kazakhstan as a chair of the Third Conference of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons will make every effort to achieve the universal goal of the total elimination of nuclear weapons.\n\nDuring the sideline events, Rakhmetullin met with representatives of states party to NPT, including the U.S. Under Secretary of State Bonnie Jenkins, Assistant Minister for Trade of Australia Senator Tim Ayres, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration of Moldova Ruslan Bolbocean to discuss expansion of cooperation on the peaceful use of atomic energy.\n\nThe treaty was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1968 and legalized the nuclear arsenals of the United Kingdom, China, Russia, the United States, and France.

Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons took effect last year, without support from the United States, Russia, China, and other nuclear-armed countries.\n\n\"We have been extraordinarily lucky so far.

We must work relentlessly towards this goal.\"\n\nThe NPT review conference comes as Russia's ongoing assault on Ukraine and rising tensions between the U.S. and China continue to heighten fears of a large-scale conflict, one that could involve the use of nuclear weaponry. Recent research indicates that the global nuclear stockpile is set to grow in the coming years for the first time since the Cold War era.\n\nThe U.S., Russia, and China are signatories to the NPT, but each has been criticized for failing to live up to their obligations under the agreement, which requires all 191 parties to \"pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament.\"\n\nIn his speech Monday, Guterres said NPT signatories must use this month's conference to make \"new commitments to shrink the numbers of all kinds of nuclear weapons so that they no longer hang by a thread over humanity.\"\n\n\"Future generations are counting on your commitment to step back from the abyss,\" Guterres added. \"We have a shared obligation to leave the world a better, safer place than we found it.

As a result, during the last [review conference] in 2015, NPT members didn't agree on a final declaration because of divergent disarmament objectives -- just as they failed in the 1980, 1990, 1995, and 2005 conferences.\"\n\n\"If consensus falls apart yet again,\" Rodriguez added, \"doubts will rise about the viability of the NPT regime.\"", "source": {"uri": "wallstreetwindow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WallStreetWindow"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 9, "stanza_neu": 14, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 23, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7137504947", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "22:29:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T22:29:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T22:29:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "url": "https://cathnews.com/cathnews/44862-pope-calls-for-a-world-free-of-nuclear-weapons", "title": "Pope calls for a world free of nuclear weapons", "body": "Pope Francis sent a tweet stressing that the \"use of nuclear weapons, as well as their mere possession, is immoral\".

View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN)United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Gutteres is hardly a global figure given to panic, or hyperbole for that matter. But rarely has he seemed quite so afraid.\n\n\"Humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,\" Gutteres said this week. The way he and a growing number of those who think deeply about nuclear issues and their consequences see it, the world is plunging headlong towards potential Armageddon, with little regard to the consequences of their actions, or inaction.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seems to have paid little heed to such fears as she moved blithely ahead with her visit to Taiwan in the face of dire warnings from the leadership of mainland China, whose arsenal of 350 nuclear weapons lies just across a narrow strait. And this in the context of bellicose words and actions from Russian President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine and Kim Jong Un's ongoing nuclear rhetoric and actions in nearby North Korea.Gutteres's fears, of course, were broader and deeper than this single Asian flashpoint. He was addressing a world conference of the nations that have signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons -- a gathering delayed by two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Read MoreSigned on July 1, 1968, by 93 nations, and in force two years later, the treaty now has 191 adherents. Yet never has it seemed more vulnerable, if not more relevant, than today. The context, as Gutteres observed, was that this year's conference -- the 10th since its signing -- \"occurs at a time of nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War.\" Indeed, the very foundations of global security that have effectively guaranteed the peace since the explosion of the \"Fat Man\" plutonium device -- the last ever detonated in battle over Nagasaki on August 9, 1945 -- have been deeply eroded. The United States was, and remains, the only nation ever to have detonated a nuclear weapon in a war. The Soviet Union tested its first device four years later. In July 1959, then-French President Charles de Gaulle sent the Count Alexandre de Marenches, the co-author of our book, \"The Fourth World War\" to Washington, to ask US President Dwight Eisenhower to give France the secrets that would allow the French to join the nuclear club. Ike politely but firmly declined. Still, in less than a year, France had exploded its first nuclear device, eight years after the British. Russia was already en route to equalizing this balance. By the early 1960s, the Kremlin had deployed the first of what would be an arsenal of more than 3,000 nuclear weapons to Ukraine, where some of the first steps toward a Soviet bomb had been taken in Ukrainian institutes located in the now deeply contested cities of Kharkiv and Donetsk. More Soviet weapons then found their way to Belarus and Kazakhstan. By the mid-1960s, on the western side of the Iron Curtain there were three nuclear powers (the US, Britain and France), on the eastern side, four ostensibily nuclear-armed states, though utterly controlled by the Kremlin. Effectively, there were just two nuclear blocs.There are many who look back on that era as the good old days of nuclear confrontation -- and with good reason. Each side, for decades, possessed enough nuclear weapons -- as many as 41,000 for the USSR and 31,000 for the US at their respective peaks -- to have utterly obliterated the other side, not to mention all life on earth. This led to the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD).Since then, arms control agreements have reduced the size of these arsenals dramatically -- to levels still able to incinerate the earth, but without reducing much of the tension. While arsenals have shrunk since the Cold War, the number of countries with nuclear weapons has proliferated. How is it at all possible to have MAD when you have nuclear weapons in the hands of nine powers? (The countries in question are the US, Britain, France, Israel, Pakistan, India, Russia, China, and North Korea.) Within this group of nations, there are pockets of mutually assured destruction. Some 93% of all the world's 13,900 nuclear weapons are still controlled by Washington and Moscow.To a degree, MAD prevails there, and indeed the prospect of mutually assured destruction comprises a good part of what has deterred Pakistan and India from launching their arsenals at each other during any of three Indo-Pakistani wars or other regular confrontations across their contested borders. A broader threat, though, has only expanded. How likely is it that given some existential challenge, Russia or even China, which arrived in the nuclear club in 1964, might not deploy a weapon of their own? Certainly, Russia has issued such a threat in Ukraine. Just weeks before its invasion of Ukraine, Russia conducted maneuvers with nuclear units, while Putin announced that his nuclear deterrent forces were being placed on a \"special regime of alert.\" And then there are the peripheral nuclear powers. While most of the world has been preoccupied with Ukraine, Taiwan, and terrorist leaders in Afghanistan, North Korea has continued to launch missiles and threaten new rounds of nuclear tests. On Victory Day last month, Kim Jong Un warned he was \"ready to mobilize\" his nuclear deterrent. Finally, we are potentially within weeks of a new round of escalations, this time involving Iran. Though Secretary of State Antony Blinken has embraced a return to the conference table to restore the nuclear accord that was restraining Iran's headlong dash toward a nuclear weapon, there is little real evidence Iran is prepared to agree. Indeed, on Monday the Biden administration unveiled a new round of sanctions targeting \"illicit\" support of the Iranian oil industry, which is already under crushing sanctions. And there are indications that the \"breakout time\" -- the time needed for Iran to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon -- has shrunk to near-zero. Should Iran test or even exhibit the capacity to test a nuclear weapon, its arch enemy Saudi Arabia has already indicated it will do all within its power to deploy its own. Indeed, it has fostered close relations with the nuclear programs of Pakistan and with China, whose appetite for foreign sources of oil knows few bounds. It is hardly surprising that the UN Secretary-General has waxed so pessimistic. The speeches that followed his opening of the non-proliferation conference seemed scarcely calculated to return the genie to its nuclear bottle. Blinken charged in his speech at the same conference that Russia is \"engaged in reckless, dangerous nuclear saber-rattling\" in Ukraine, while North Korea \"is preparing to conduct its 7th nuclear test.\" And as for Iran, it \"remains on a path of nuclear escalation.\" \"To escape the logic of fear,\" Blinken concluded, should be the most immediate mission of all nations who've agreed to restrain the proliferation of nuclear arms.Somehow, though, an even more worthwhile objective might just be for the world to find a way to turn back the clock from 2022 to 1962 or even 1982. These were terrifying years when, innocently, we practiced weekly duck-and-cover exercises under our little wooden desks in kindergarten, dug home fallout shelters in our backyards against an imminent nuclear attack.

In his speech, Mr Cassis emphasised that Russia's nuclear threats illustrated the need for a package of measures to reduce nuclear risks. Recent developments in Ukraine have also shown that civilian nuclear facilities must be protected in situations of armed conflict. Switzerland thus wants to ensure nuclear safety and security and give new impetus to nuclear disarmament. The Conference will end on 26 August.\n\n\"Switzerland wants to see a world free of nuclear weapons,\" said President of the Confederation Ignazio Cassis, speaking at the Review Conference of the 191 parties to the NPT on 2 August 2022. \"The consequences of the use of nuclear weapons would be catastrophic.\" Mr Cassis noted that any use of a nuclear weapon would violate the 75-year-old nuclear taboo that has existed since the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and would risk a nuclear escalation. That is why Switzerland aims to bring momentum to stalled nuclear disarmament processes. In view of this, Mr Cassis called on the Conference to send a signal that nuclear weapons must never be used again: \"This conference must set the course for an urgently needed change: to reduce the role of nuclear weapons, to reduce the likelihood of a nuclear accident or usage as a result of a misunderstanding. Words must be complemented by concrete action to avert humanitarian and environmental disasters.\"\n\nMeasures to reduce nuclear threats\n\nIn the lead up to the Conference, Switzerland was the driving force behind a package of measures - supported by around 30 states - that aims to reduce nuclear risk and to make the world more resilient in times of crisis. Such measures include crisis communication hotlines and other channels that help prevent unintentional escalation.\n\nSwitzerland attaches a key priority to nuclear disarmament and the prevention of nuclear proliferation since peace and security are priorities of its foreign policy. Switzerland wants to play the role of a bridge builder, striving for viable solutions and constructive dialogue. In this way, Switzerland contributes to a more secure world. It is committed to ensuring that compliance with international humanitarian law takes precedence over political or military might.\n\nSafety and security of nuclear facilities in conflict regions\n\nThe safety and security of civil nuclear power facilities in conflict regions is a key issue for Mr Cassis. The Russian aggression against Ukraine has illustrated the dangers in this area. Switzerland is working with a number of other states, as well as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure that fundamental security standards are observed. These rules are to be followed in any situation - including armed conflict - to prevent catastrophic consequences of nuclear incidents. This was emphasised by the President of the Swiss Confederation, Ignazio Cassis, and the Director General of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, at a joint event on the fringes of the Conference.\n\nRespecting the non-proliferation norm\n\nSwitzerland wants to ensure that the NPT is effective and can achieve its goals. \"We need to address regional challenges and, for example, condemn the DPRK's continued development of its nuclear programme, in violation of UN Security Council resolutions. We also need an immediate return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action by all its parties. And we must support the IAEA's safeguards system, which is the backbone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime,\" explained Mr Cassis in New York.\n\nTreaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons: Switzerland re-evaluates its position\n\nThe outcome of the current NPT Review Conference in New York will be an important aspect in Switzerland's re-evaluation of its position on the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). While the NPT prevents a global arms race without restricting the peaceful use of the atom, the TPNW prohibits the development, testing, production, transfer, possession, use and threat of use of nuclear weapons. Switzerland is not a party to this new treaty, which entered into force in 2021. For the time being, it is monitoring its further development. This treaty was negotiated without the nuclear powers and is supported only by a part of the international community. In the EU, for example, only three countries are members of the TPNW. For Switzerland, questions thus remain about its effectiveness. It would be counterproductive if the NPT as a universally recognised instrument for nuclear disarmament were to be hampered by TPNW. In New York, Switzerland is also working towards an outcome of the NPT Review Conference that will lead to positive interaction between the two treaties, since both treaties share the same objective, i.e. achieving a world without nuclear weapons.\n\nFederal Department of Foreign Affairs\n\nhttps://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home.html", "source": {"uri": "admin.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Swiss Federal Gouvernment"}, "authors": [{"uri": "federal_council@admin.ch", "name": "Federal Council", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 5, "stanza_neu": 34, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 41, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7138063236", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-03", "time": "10:00:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-03T10:00:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-03T08:52:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "url": "https://www.no2nuclearpower.org.uk/news/npt-3-8-22/", "title": "NPT - No2NuclearPower", "body": "The NPT Review Conference takes place amid a rapidly deteriorating international security environment, with an increased risk of nuclear weapons use.

In the lead-up to this year's NPT Review Conference, which opened Monday in New York, Russia and NATO are putting the treaty at risk.\n\nThe NPT was conceived as a grand bargain between nations who did not have nuclear weapons and promised not to develop them and the P5, who did have them in 1968 and promised, in Article VI of the treaty, to undertake good faith negotiations to eliminate their nuclear arsenals.\n\nIn the five decades since, these five nuclear-armed states have continued to insist that other signatories to the treaty honor their commitment not to build nuclear weapons, but they have never seriously considered meeting their obligations to disarm.\n\nTension over this blatant failure to uphold their end of the bargain has been growing for years and helped fuel the 2017 adoption by 121 non-nuclear-armed states of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, a new treaty consistent with Article VI and intended to pressure the countries that have nuclear weapons to meet their obligations to get rid of them.\n\nThe gap between the promises of the P5 and their behavior has grown into a chasm since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia has made repeated threats to use nuclear weapons and NATO -- representing France, the United Kingdom and the United States -- has replied with nuclear threats of its own.\n\nResponding to this escalating danger of nuclear war, 18 Nobel Peace Laureates issued a statement in April urging Russia and NATO to pledge publicly that they will not use nuclear weapons under any circumstances in the current war. The statement was endorsed by more than 1 million people after it was posted to the Avaaz website. The response from Russia and NATO was a thunderous silence.\n\nIt is now clear: Not only will they not begin negotiations to eliminate their nuclear arsenals, as they promised decades ago; they will not even pledge not to start World War III. The world cannot ignore the terrible danger of this moment. We are living through a potential planetary near-death experience where a few people have the power to destroy civilization and the rest of us are reduced to pleading with them not to do it. This is not normal, and it is not necessary.\n\nThe world must demand that Russia and NATO state unequivocally that they will not use nuclear weapons. And we must go beyond the immediate crisis in Ukraine and make sure we are never in this situation again.\n\nNuclear weapons are not a force of nature over which we have no control. They are machines that we have made with our own hands, and we know how to take them apart. We must take advantage of the increased awareness of the nuclear danger to bring about fundamental change in nuclear policy and eliminate these weapons before they eliminate us.\n\nFor decades, leaders of the nuclear-armed states have promoted the myth of \"deterrence,\" as though these weapons possess some magic power that assures they will never be used.\n\nThe current threats by Russia and NATO reveal the truth: Nuclear-armed states possess these weapons to threaten and bully the rest of the world -- and they are prepared to use them. As former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara famously observed, we have not avoided nuclear war because of sound doctrine or wise leaders or infallible technology. \"We lucked out,\" he said. \"It was luck that prevented nuclear war.\"\n\nIt is hard to imagine how Russia and NATO imagine that they will convince the rest of the world to continue to abstain from acquiring nuclear weapons while they themselves threaten to use them. If they do destroy the NPT regime, the danger of nuclear war will become more acute.\n\nBut even if the rest of the world continues to act responsibly, the possession of these weapons by the current nuclear-armed states poses an unacceptable risk to humanity. Here in the United States, we need to support the Back from the Brink campaign's call for the U.S. to commence negotiations with the other eight nuclear-armed states for a verifiable, enforceable, time-bound agreement to eliminate their nuclear weapons. We either get rid of them or accept that, sooner or later, our luck will run out and the weapons will get rid of us.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/UN-Nuclear-Treaty-Conference-08012022.jpg?w=1280", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 6, "stanza_neu": 24, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 30, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7140714569", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-05", "time": "09:41:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-05T09:41:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-05T09:40:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "url": "https://foreignaffairs.co.nz/2022/08/05/mil-osi-europe-dutch-efforts-to-curb-nuclear-weapons-the-non-proliferation-treaty/", "title": "MIL-OSI Europe: Dutch efforts to curb nuclear weapons: the Non-Proliferation Treaty", "body": "The Non-Proliferation Treaty is the only international treaty containing binding legal commitments that prohibit the manufacture of nuclear weapons for countries that do not possess them, prohibit the dissemination of such weapons, provide for the transition to nuclear disarmament and regulate access to nuclear energy and technology for non-nuclear-weapon states. The treaty has been signed by 191 countries, including the Netherlands. Only India, Pakistan, North Korea and South Sudan have not become parties.\n\nThe Non-Proliferation Treaty has three pillars:\n\nThis 1970 treaty contains obligations for the five recognised nuclear-weapon states: the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France, Russia and China. Compliance by these states is crucial. The treaty also contains obligations for non-nuclear-weapon states.\n\nThanks to the NPT, fewer than ten countries possess nuclear weapons. That makes the treaty a cornerstone of the international legal order. The NPT also facilitates large-scale use of nuclear energy and technology for peaceful purposes.\n\nEvery five years, the Parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty gather for an NPT Review Conference. At this conference, held at the United Nations headquarters, the Parties discuss new and existing agreements and whether everyone concerned is complying with their obligations. The tenth review conference was originally planned for 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic it was postponed until 2022 (2-26 August). It's high time, since efforts to curb nuclear weapons - and therefore the NPT itself - are under strain. Critics say that worldwide disarmament is proceeding too slowly. Russia's aggression also has major implications for global security.\n\nThe Netherlands believes that the current tensions make it all the more important to uphold the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The conference will devote a great deal of attention to President Putin's threats about the potential use of nuclear weapons and violations of international nuclear safety and security agreements (for instance in relation to nuclear power plants). Russia is one of the countries attending the conference.\n\nThe Dutch government believes that specific agreements must be reached, for example to avoid misunderstandings, miscommunication or accidents. The worldwide norm against the use of nuclear weapons must remain in place. To this end, the Netherlands is focusing on a variety of themes aimed at bringing disarmament closer. These include transparency, the ban on the production of fissile material (FMCT), the ban on nuclear testing (Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, in Dutch), risk reduction, bolstering the NPT review mechanism, the development and improvement of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Standards, and promoting new technologies.\n\nThis year the Netherlands holds the vice-presidency of the NPT Review Conference, together with Poland and Malaysia, under Argentina's presidency. A representative of each of these three countries chairs a committee whose remit covers one of the NPT's three pillars. The committee chaired by a Dutch representative will focus on the right to peaceful use of nuclear energy and technology.\n\nThere are unique opportunities today for the peaceful use of nuclear energy and technology, but sound agreements on safety and security are of course essential. Nuclear science and technologies are capable of offering solutions to the greatest challenges of our times. These include combating cancer and zoonoses, controlling pests and pathogens, as well as supporting sustainable agriculture and climate adaptation.\n\nAt the NPT Review Conference, Dutch efforts will focus on establishing a clear strategy for the future. It is important to evaluate what has happened in the past five years, but even more important to have a result-oriented action plan for the next five years in order to help make the world a safer place.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 3, "stanza_neu": 23, "stanza_pos": 5, "swn_neg": 31, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7137337815", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "18:48:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T18:48:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T18:43:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "url": "https://thefrontierpost.com/p5-and-iaeas-global-role/", "title": "P5 and IAEA's global role - The Frontier Post", "body": "The leaders of France, the UK, and the United States remained firmly committed to the objectives contained in the statement of January 3, 2022, on preventing nuclear war and avoiding an arms race.

The three nations said that they recognize and act with a deep understanding that nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. The three allies further reaffirmed their aspirations and high stakes in preserving the record of nonuse of nuclear weapons since 1945. According to them, as nuclear weapons exist, they should serve defensive purposes, deter aggression and prevent war. The troika condemned those elements who would use or threaten to use nuclear weapons for military coercion, intimidation, and blackmail. According to western allies, such provocations are extremely dangerous and contrary to the purposes of NPT and the UN Charter. The western allies called on Russia to cease its irresponsible and dangerous nuclear rhetoric and behavior, uphold its international commitments, and commit in words and deeds, to the principle enshrined in the recent preventing nuclear war and avoiding arms race convention.\n\nThe Tenth NPT Review Conference has been kicked off in New York on August 1 and will continue until the 26th of this month. The NPT member states, international organizations, and the global community have gathered to discuss the achievements of the regimes, their failures, challenges, and weaknesses, along with the future course of action to make the world free from Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), to promote the peaceful use including generation of nuclear energy, nuclear treatment, pharmaceutical and agricultural use of nuclear technology under global regulations and monitoring.\n\nAs the international gathering began in New York, the troika of western nations, which enjoys dominance over the competing Russian Federation and the Peoples Republic of China within the privileged P5 bloc of nuclear powers in the global forum. Earlier, the group of five enjoyed complete dominance over the entire international community at all forums, and in all global treaties including the NPT, CTBT, FMCT, and others.\n\nHowever, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the start of US-China rivalry in the Indo-Pacific waters, the group of five had split into two factions and western allies parted their ways with Russia and China. Recently, the western P3 vowed to defend NPT regimes and urged the Russian Federation to cease its nuclear intimidation of other nations and fulfill its commitments to the NPT regime and global peace.\n\nCurrently, the international community and the IAEA have several challenges relating to global peace and nuclear Non-Proliferation such as the revival of Iran's nuclear deal, nuclear intimidation of North Korea, safety and protection of nuclear installations in war-hit Ukraine, tackling challenges of climate change and Global pandemics including COVID-19, Ebola, and monkeypox, etc. While enabling non-nuclear member states for Peaceful use of nuclear technology under IAEA's Peaceful Uses Initiative (PUI) has become more urgent and decisive due to the disastrous effects of climate change.

First, the escalation of the Ukraine crisis with Ukraine becoming a proxy country in the real conflict between the USA and Russia has led to tensions worsening steadily. What is most worrying is that unlike in the case of most recent wars, no credible, hope giving peace processes appears to be at work after more than five months of highly damaging war. Then more recently, tensions between the USA and China have also escalated over Taiwan which runs the risk of becoming another proxy country in big power rivalry for dominance.\n\nThe most frightening aspect of the present threatening situation, which was not relevant before the start of the two world wars, is that all the three involved countries have the biggest stocks of nuclear weapons. In addition six other countries also have nuclear weapons.\n\nEric Schlosser, a widely acclaimed writer on nuclear weapons, has spoken at length to top officials and commanders at various stages of planning and control of nuclear weapons. In addition he has close contacts with peace movements struggling for a world free from nuclear weapons. He has written that these very different persons all share a very strong and sincere desire to avoid actual use of nuclear weapons. The reason why both these sections share this strong belief is that both groups are well-informed about what actual use of nuclear weapons means.\n\nSchlosser has written, \"The latest studies suggest that a relatively small nuclear exchange (relative to the total number of nuclear weapons that exist in world) would have long-term effects across the globe. A war between India and Pakistan, involving a hundred atomic bombs like the kind dropped in Hiroshima, could send five million tons of dust into the atmosphere, shrink the ozone layer by as much as fifty per cent, drop worldwide temperatures to their lowest point in a thousand years, create worldwide famines and cause more than a billion casualties.\"\n\nWhile this has been written in the context of the use of 100 nuclear weapons of roughly the destructiveness of Hiroshima weapon, the total number of nuclear weapons in the world is over 13,000 and the destructive capacity of many such weapons is much higher than the bomb used on the people of Hiroshima.\n\nIt is clear that apart from killing millions of people immediately, exchange of nuclear weapons can lead to unprecedented environmental catastrophe which can kill an even larger number of people while also destroying other life-forms like never before. If the nuclear weapon exchange is between two countries alone, people particularly of neighboring countries will also suffer very serious consequences without being involved in any dispute at all.\n\nSome strategists have argued that there can be a less catastrophic role for nuclear weapons in the form of tactical nuclear weapons. As not just peace movements but several independent experts have pointed out, this is a highly flawed and mistaken view. A nuclear war started with tactical weapons can easily spill into a full-blown nuclear war if the opposing side also has nuclear weapons. Secondly, use of even tactical nuclear weapons can be very destructive, even for the using country!\n\nPakistan in particular has been keen to develop tactical nuclear weapons in recent times as it feels that this can be one way of checking and defeating an invasion by a country with superior conventional war capability and bigger economic resources. However saner scientific voices in Pakistan have warned that if Pakistan uses tactical weapons against an invading army on its land, its own military and civilian losses can be very high due to the highly destructive impacts of these weapons.\n\nIn the much earlier days of the cold war the NATO had stocked a lot of tactical nuclear weapons in West Germany to check a possible Soviet invasion. A war game Carte Blanche was played out to see the possible impacts in case of a Soviet invasion. It was realized only then that German civilian deaths from the use of tactical nuclear weapons on its own land can be higher than total German civilian deaths in the Second World War! Such is the destructive power of these weapons.\n\nMoreover when tactical nuclear weapons have to be prepared for use then control has to be more dispersed and scattered. This increases the possibility that persons with fanatic or fundamentalist leanings can also gain access to this control.\n\nHence the possibilities of terrorists gaining access to such control also increase at least to some extent.\n\nIt is therefore not at all proper to be under the false impression that tactical weapons provide some form of safer nuclear weapons. Let no one create such a false impression as such a delusion can be extremely catastrophic for millions and millions of people.\n\nLet us face the reality. All evidence points to the fact that nuclear weapons should never be used. In fact even accidental use of nuclear weapons or accidents relating to nuclear weapons can be very destructive. Hence ultimately the only safe option if we care for life on earth is to give up all nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass destruction once and for all. The more you study and explore this issue, no matter which side you belong to, the only honest conclusion can be that tomorrow if not today we have to do away with nuclear weapons if we want to save life on earth; so why not make a beginning today itself.\n\nThe only safe world is a world which is entirely free of nuclear weapons as well as all weapons of mass destruction. Unfortunately instead of at least moving to some extent in this direction the world has been moving in the opposite direction in recent times and this year 2022 appears so far to have been the worst in this context. Disarmament talks are lagging far behind than earlier expectations while tensions over Ukraine and Taiwan are escalating faster than ever before. Clearly this is a very dangerous situation and all peace loving forces of world should cooperate to soon move out of this dangerous situation.\n\nBharat Dogra is Convener, Campaign to Save Earth Now.

The reclusive country withdrew from the NPT in January 2003.\n\nBlinken said the U.S. will not use nuclear weapons, unless necessary to defend itself and its allies.\n\n\"As long as nuclear weapons exist, the fundamental role of U.S. nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear attacks on the United States, on our allies and partners,\" he said.\n\n\"The United States would only consider the use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States and its allies and partners,\" added Blinken.\n\nHe noted the treaty was facing many challenges.\n\n\"This is a critical moment for the NPT,\" Blinken said while speaking later to reporters in New York.\n\n\"It's a challenging one, too, because different parts of this regime are under challenge, and of course, we see that particularly in the area of non-proliferation. One, we have challenges being posed by Iran, by North Korea, and now in different ways by Russia,\" he added.\n\nBlinken also underscored the need to implement and further strengthen the NPT.\n\n\"This has now been enforced for 50 years.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on June 11, 2018, at the United Nations in New York. (Li Muzi/Xinhua/Zuma Press/TNS)\n\nOn Monday, the top United Nations official warned that humanity is just one \"misunderstanding\" or \"miscalculation\" away from \"nuclear annihilation.\"\n\nDuring the Tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in New York City, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that nuclear war is imminent as conflicts \"with nuclear undertones\" fester around the world.\n\n\"Almost 13,000 nuclear weapons are now being held in arsenals around the world. All this at a time when the risks of proliferation are growing and guardrails to prevent escalation are weakening. And when crises -- with nuclear undertones -- are festering,\" Guterres said. \"From the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula. To the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and to many other factors around the world.\"\n\n\"Excellencies, the clouds that parted following the end of the Cold War are gathering once more. We have been extraordinarily lucky so far. But luck is not a strategy. Nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict,\" he warned. \"Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation.\"\n\nGuterres said humanity is \"in danger of forgetting the lessons forged in the terrifying fires of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\" He argued that governments around the world are seeking \"false security\" in stockpiling nuclear weapons, which he characterized as \"doomsday weapons that have no place on our planet.\"\n\nThe secretary-general called for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in an effort to avoid \"certain disaster.\"\n\nGuterres argued \"reducing the risk of war is not enough\" and \"eliminating nuclear weapons is the only guarantee they will never be used.\"\n\n\"We must work relentlessly towards this goal. This must start with new commitments to shrink the numbers of all kinds of nuclear weapons so that they no longer hang by a thread over humanity,\" he said. \"And it means reinvigorating -- and fully resourcing -- our multilateral agreements and frameworks around disarmament and non-proliferation, including the important work of the International Atomic Energy Agency. \"\n\n\"We are all here today because we believe in the Treaty's purpose and function. But carrying it into the future requires going beyond the status quo. It requires renewed commitment, and real, good faith negotiations,\" Guterres continued. \"And it requires all Parties to listen, compromise and keep the lessons of the past -- and the fragility of the future -- in view at all times.\"\n\n\"Excellencies, future generations are counting on your commitment to step back from the abyss. We have a shared obligation to leave the world a better, safer place than we found it,\" he added. \"This is our moment to meet this basic test, and lift the cloud of nuclear annihilation, once and for all.\"\n\nThe warning came on the same day Chinese missile forces posted photos of their nuclear Dongfeng DF-17 \"Carrier Killer\" missiles ahead of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.", "source": {"uri": "americanmilitarynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Military News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liz_george@americanmilitarynews.com", "name": "Liz George", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://americanmilitarynews.com/wp-content/uploads/WORLD-NEWS-YEMEN-FORGOTTEN-WAR-ZUM-e1659471946179.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 22, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 29, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7137312381", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "18:20:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T18:20:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T18:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.658823549747467, "url": "https://uk.news.yahoo.com/russia-ukraine-war-grain-tycoons-031031796.html", "title": "Putin warns nuclear war should 'never be unleashed'", "body": "No one can win from a nuclear war and it should \"never be unleashed\", Vladimir Putin has warned.\n\nThe Russian president warned on Monday that there could be \"no winners\" if such a conflict was to break out. He made the statement as a review of a keystone nuclear treaty opened at the United Nations.\n\nMr Putin insisted that Moscow had \"consistently\" remained faithful to the Non Proliferation Treaty's (NPT) \"letter and spirit\" in his address to the Tenth NPT Review Conference.\n\nIt marked a change of tone from the start of his invasion of Ukraine, when the strongman leader made thinly veiled threats hinting at a willingness to deploy Russia's tactical nuclear weapons, which according to Russian military doctrine can be used to force an adversary to retreat.\n\nThe US, Britain and France had rebuked Russia for \"irresponsible and dangerous\" talk about possibly deploying nuclear weapons. Ties between Russia and the West have been unravelling over the course of the conflict, now five months in.\n\nOpening the conference in New York, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres warned that the world now faces a \"nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War\".\n\n\"Humanity is just one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,\" he said.

Both the ship, the Laodicea, and its cargo, were ordered seized by a Ukrainian judge on Friday.\n\nMoscow has denied the claims it had stolen grain from Ukraine. The Russian embassy in Lebanon has said it had no information regarding the cargo.\n\nAn official from the Turkey-based company that owns the cargo, Loyal Agro Co LTD, told Reuters last week it was carrying 8,000 tonnes of flour and 1,700 tonnes of barley and denied the cargo was stolen from Ukraine.\n\nJoe Biden has urged Russia and China to enter nuclear arms control talks in light of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe US President reiterated that his administration is ready to \"expeditiously negotiate\" a replacement to New START, the treaty capping intercontinental nuclear forces in the United States and Russia, which is set to expire in 2026.\n\n\"Russia should demonstrate that it is ready to resume work on nuclear arms control,\" Biden said.\n\n\"But negotiation requires a willing partner operating in good faith. And Russia's brutal and unprovoked aggression in Ukraine has shattered peace in Europe and constitutes an attack on fundamental tenets of international order.\"\n\nTurning to China, which has been bolstering its much smaller nuclear arsenal, Biden said the communist state has a duty as a permanent member of the UN Security Council \"to engage in talks that will reduce the risk of miscalculation and address destabilizing military dynamics.\"\n\n\"There is no benefit to any of our nations, or for the world, to resist substantive engagement on arms control and nuclear non-proliferation,\" Biden said.\n\nThe adoption of Russian children by citizens of \"unfriendly countries\" will be banned under a bill introduced to the lower house of the country's parliament.\n\nRussia's list of unfriendly countries was expanded after many nations imposed sanctions in response to Russia's deployment of troops to Ukraine in February.\n\nIt currently includes the United States, United Kingdom, all European Union member states, as well as Japan and South Korea.\n\nA crew member on the first ship carrying grains out of Ukraine since the lifting of a Russian blockade of its ports has hailed it as the \"best feeling\" of the year.\n\nRecalling hearing the news that a landmark deal had been reached to unblock Ukraine's Black Sea delivery routes, junior engineer Abdullah Jendi, from Syria, said: \"It was a great feeling.\n\n\"Everyone on the ship was very happy. I can say that it was the best feeling we have had in 2022.\"\n\nThe Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni left Odesa bound for Lebanon on Monday with 27,000 tonnes of grain.\n\n\"To be honest, I am scared from the fact that there are naval mines,\" Jendi said. \"This is the only thing that I fear during this trip, as for the other things, we are used to them as sailors.\"\n\nJendi said alarms would go off in Odesa every day and the crew feared they would never get to go home.\n\n\"We did not know when we would be released, so we lived every day on the hope of being released,\" he said.\n\nUkrainian forces have recaptured more than 40 settlements in the key southern region of Kherson, the local governor said.\n\nKyiv is looking to drive back Russian troops in a counter-offensive after Moscow seized almost all the territory of the economically and strategically important region bordering the annexed Crimea peninsula early in the invasion.\n\nRecent weeks have seen the Ukrainian army, bolstered by deliveries of Western-supplied long-range artillery, have sought to stage a counter-offensive in the area.\n\n\"Today, 46 settlements have already been de-occupied in the Kherson region,\" Dmytro Butriy, the head of the Ukrainian regional administration, told national TV.\n\nThe Pope could meet the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church for the first time since warning against becoming \"Putin's altar boy\".\n\nThe Vatican on Monday confirmed that Pope Francis, 85, will attend an interfaith conference in Kazakstan's capital, Nur-Sultan, from September 13-15.\n\nPatriach Kirill, who has justified Moscow's war in Ukraine as a \"metaphysical\" battle with the West, has been invited and the Moscow Patriarchate has said he would attend the \"Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions\".\n\nPope Francis publicly criticised Kirill's support for the war, telling an Italian newspaper that the patriarch shouldn't become \"Putin's altar boy\" in May.\n\nThe Russian Patriarchate said it was regrettable\" that Francis \"chose the wrong tone\" to relay the contents of their March video call.\n\nFrancis and Kirill, who had a first historic encounter in Havana in 2016, have spoken by video call at least once since the war began. A planned encounter in Jerusalem in June was called off by Francis for diplomatic reasons.\n\nUkraine has received a batch of four more US-made high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), Ukraine's defence minister said.\n\nOleksii Reznikov, the minister, wrote on Twitter: \"I'm grateful to the President of the United States and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin III and the US people for strengthening of Ukrainian Army.\"\n\nThe state-of-the-art weapons systems have a longer range and are more precise than Ukraine's Soviet-era artillery. They have been credited for stemming the advance of Moscow's forces in Ukraine.\n\nThe EU has sent Ukraine \u20ac1bn in financial aid to support its budget and help it tackle the financial consequences of the Russian invasion.\n\nDenys Shmygal, the Ukrainian prime minister, said on the Telegram app: \"The \u20ac1bn is a part of a large package of support for Ukraine... totaling nine billion euros. The funds will help finance priority budgetary needs.\"\n\nHe said that the first tranche, amounting to 500 million euros, is already on the account of the Ukrainian central bank, while the remainder is expected to be there tomorrow.\n\nUkraine has expressed hopes to reopen the major port in the southern frontier-city of Mykolaiv after the first grains shipment left Odesa since Russia agreed to unblock its Black Sea delivery routes.\n\nUkraine's infrastructure minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said it will start consultations to resume its exports if the exports deal struck with Russia, UN and Turkey holds in full.\n\n\"I hope that if this initiative works, we will soon move on to consultations... to do this with the port of Mykolaiv,\" he said.\n\n\"When the initiative starts working in full, we would want to go to three million tonnes of exports of our agricultural produce.\"\n\nHe added the first ship is due to pass through the Bosphorus, a strait dominated by the Russian Navy that links the Black Sea with the Mediterranean, tomorrow.\n\n\"This ship will pass through the Bosphorus tomorrow, and later we hope it will successfully reach Lebanon,\" he said.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said western allies \"strongly support the full implementation of the deal to ease the global food crisis caused by Russia's war in Ukraine\".\n\nHis comments came after Razoni, a Sierra Leone-registered cargo ship, left the Ukrainian port of Odessa bound for Lebanon with a vital shipment of 26,000 tonnes of grain.\n\nIt was the first vessel to leave a Ukrainian port since Moscow and Kyiv signed an agreement brokered by Turkey and the UN to free up food shipments despite their conflict.\n\nPM Boris Johnson has joined EU and Liz Truss in welcoming today's landmark first Ukraine grains shipment as a \"first step\".\n\nUK manufacturing is grinding to a halt as the Ukraine war compounds rocketing inflation, supply issues and global market uncertainty.\n\nAn industry index rated last month's manufacturing at 52.1 - the lowest in 25 months and down from 52.8 in June.\n\nAny number on S&P Global/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI above 50 is seen as growth, so it means the sector is only just growing.\n\nRob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: \"Rising market uncertainty, the cost of living crisis, war in Ukraine, ongoing supply issues and inflationary pressures are all hitting demand for goods at the same time, while lingering post-Brexit issues and the darkening global economic backdrop are hampering exports.\n\n\"With the Bank of England implementing further interest rate hikes to combat inflation, the outlook is beset with downside risks.\n\n\"With this in mind, the continued low degree of optimism among manufacturers is of little surprise.\"\n\nA Ukrainian soldier's moving reunion with his grandmother has been shared by the media outlet Nexta.\n\nThe EU has welcomed the departure of a grain shipment from Ukraine as a \"first step\" towards mitigating the food crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of its neighbour.\n\nBut EU spokesman Peter Stano said Brussels still expects the \"implementation of the whole deal and resumption of Ukrainian exports to the customers around the world.\"\n\nUK Foreign Secretary and Tory leadership frontrunner Liz Truss earlier said: \"This is an important first step. The UK and our allies have pushed hard for this outcome. We are grateful to the UN and Turkey for helping to secure this agreement.\"\n\nA hospital A&E has been partially destroyed by overnight Russian shelling in the southern city of Mykolaiv.\n\nMayor Oleksandr Senkevych earlier described more than 12 Russian missile strikes as \"probably the most powerful on the city\".\n\nUkraine agricultural products exports rose by 12 per cent to three million tonnes in July despite the Russian blockade of its ports, the Ukrainian Club of Agrarian Business Associations (UCAB) said.\n\nMonthly grains exports rose by 21 per cent to 1.7 million tonnes although they remains a fraction of the six million Ukraine distributed before the start of the war.\n\nAs the first shipment of grains left Ukraine's newly unblocked ports today, the UCAB warned: \"Only in the case of the full functioning of these three sea ports and full loading of alternative routes can we hope for the volume of exports that was before the beginning of the... Russian invasion.\"\n\nOver the weekend Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky warned Ukraine's harvest could be up to 50 per cent smaller than usual this year because of Russia's war.\n\nHe said that in spite of the depleted harvest, Ukraine's \"main goal\" was to prevent a global food crisis, andthat the country's authorities would find alternative ways to export grain, amid fears that millions could go hungry because large parts of the world rely on Ukraine for their food supply.\n\nThe Kremlin on Monday welcomed the departure of the first shipment of grain from Ukraine's southern port of Odessa under a plan to resume grain exports that were halted following the start of Moscow's military campaign.\n\n\"As for the departure of the first ship, this is very positive. A good opportunity to test the effectiveness of the mechanisms that were agreed during talks in Istanbul,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.\n\nA senior Russian official has outlined plans to rebuild Ukraine's southern port city of Mariupol that suffered a devastating siege and heavy shelling before being captured by Russian troops.\n\nRussian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin said in an interview with Russia's RBC TV channel that the first buildings currently under construction will be ready by the autumn.\n\n\"The first residential buildings will be standing by September. We will already have the first hospitals, will build a centre of the emergencies ministry,\" he said.\n\nKhusnullin also said there were plans to rebuild the historic centre of Mariupol, renovating all buildings that were not completely destroyed by Russian shelling.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said on Monday that its forces had destroyed two U.S.-made Himars in Ukraine's Kharkiv region, and a launch system for Harpoon anti-ship missiles in Odesa region, Interfax reported.\n\nThe Reuters news agency said it was unable to independently verify the reports.\n\nLiz Truss, the UK's Foreign Secretary, said in a statement: \"This is an important first step. The UK and our allies have pushed hard for this outcome. We are grateful to the UN and Turkey for helping to secure this agreement.\n\n\"Russia has felt the full weight of global pressure and the eyes of the whole world will now be watching to see if they continue to weaponise global food supplies as they have been until now.\n\n\"These ships must receive safe passage. There must be no repeat of Russia's shelling of the port of Odesa. The only way Putin can truly alleviate the global food security crisis he has created is by ending his brutal invasion of Ukraine.\"\n\nDmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, has hailed the departure of the first shipment of grain from the port of Odesa since the start of Russia's invasion as a \"relief for the world\".\n\n\"The day of relief for the world, especially for our friends in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa, as the first Ukrainian grain leaves Odesa after months of Russian blockade. Ukraine has always been a reliable partner and will remain one should Russia respect its part of the deal,\" Mr Kuleba tweeted.\n\nAntonio Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nation, \"warmly welcomes\" the departure of a first ship carrying Ukrainian grain under a plan to lift Russia's naval blockade, a spokesman said on Monday.\n\n\"The Secretary-General hopes that this will be the first of many commercial ships moving in accordance with the initiative signed, and that this will bring much-needed stability and relief to global food security, especially in the most fragile humanitarian contexts,\" the UN said in a statement.\n\nFollowing the departure of the first ship carrying grain from Odesa, Oleksandr Kubrakov, Ukraine's infrastructure minister, said in a statement: \"Unlocking the ports will provide at least $1 billion in foreign exchange revenue for the economy and an opportunity for the agricultural sector to plan next year's sowing season.\n\n\"In the ports of Greater Odessa another 16 vessels are already waiting their turn. These are the vessels that have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\n\"Today Ukraine, together with its partners, makes another step to prevent world hunger.\"\n\nThe Sierra Leone-flagged cargo ship, Razoni, left the port of Odesa for Lebanon, Turkey's defence ministry said. A statement from the United Nations said the Razoni is carrying over 26,000 tons of corn.\n\nData from the Razoni's Automatic Identification System, a safety tracker for ships at sea, showed the vessel slowly coming out from its berth at Odesa port Monday morning alongside a tug boat.\n\nThe first shipment of Ukrainian grain is set to leave the port of Odessa on Monday morning, the Turkish defence ministry said.\n\n\"The departure of the cargo ship Razoni flying the flag of Sierra Leone and loaded with maize will leave the port of Odessa bound for Lebanon at 08:30 (0530 GMT),\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\nHowever at 5am GMT, the ship was yet to depart.\n\nRussia is likely reallocating a significant number of its forces from the northern Donbas sector to southern Ukraine, the UK's Ministry of Defence said.\n\nIt comes as Russia's relentless assaults on the Bakhmut axis, northeast of Donetsk, have made slow progress.\n\n\"Russia is probably adjusting the operational design of its Donbas offensive after failing to make a decisive operational breakthrough under the plan it had been following since April,\" the ministry said on Twitter on Monday.\n\n\"It has likely identified its Zaporizhzhia front as a vulnerable area in need of reinforcement.\"\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky has warned that Ukraine may harvest only half its usual amount of grain this year due to the Russian invasion.\n\n\"Ukrainian harvest this year is under the threat to be twice less,\" the Ukrainian President said - suggesting half as much as usual.\n\n\"Our main goal -- to prevent global food crisis caused by Russian invasion. Still grains find a way to be delivered alternatively.\"\n\nUkraine has struggled to get its product to buyers via its Black Sea ports because of the war.\n\nBut an agreement signed under the stewardship of the United Nations and Turkey on July 22 provides for safe passage for ships carrying grain out of three southern Ukrainian ports.\n\nThere is a high possibility that the first grain-exporting ship will leave Ukraine's ports on Monday, a spokesperson for Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday.\n\nThe Sevastopol attack coincided with Russia's Navy Day, which President Vladimir Putin marked by announcing that the navy would receive what he called \"formidable\" hypersonic Zircon cruise missiles in coming months.\n\nThe missiles can travel at nine times the speed of sound, outrunning air defences.\n\nPutin did not mention the conflict in Ukraine during a speech after signing a new naval doctrine, which cast the United States as Russia's main rival and set out Russia's global maritime ambitions for crucial areas such as the Arctic and in the Black Sea.\n\nREAD MORE: US and Nato are Russia's main naval threats, says Vladimir Putin\n\nA drone strike on Russia's Black Sea naval base in Sevastopol was launched from within the city in a \"terrorist attack\", a Russian lawmaker claims.\n\nIn Russian-occupied Sevastopol, five Russian navy staff members were injured by an explosion after a presumed drone flew into the courtyard of Russia's Black Sea fleet, the Crimean port city's governor, Mikhail Razvozhayev, told Russian media.\n\nHe blamed the attack on Ukraine, saying it had decided to \"spoil Navy Day for us\".\n\nOlga Kovitidi, a member of Russia's upper house of parliament, told the Russian RIA news agency that the attack was \"undoubtedly carried out not from outside, but from the territory of Sevastopol\".\n\n\"Urgent search operations are being conducted in the city to track down the organisers of this terrorist act.

Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres says we are facing \"a time of nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War.\" His remarks came at the 2022 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons at the United Nations in New York City.\n\nThe world is now enduring greater stress than any time in recent decades, according to U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. And while humanity has so far avoided \"the suicidal mistake of nuclear conflict,\" he said, tensions are hitting new highs at a time when many lessons of the past seem forgotten. \"Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,\" the world's top diplomat said at a U.N. conference on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in New York City. It's not the first time such a dire warning has been issued about the catastrophic risks posed by nuclear weapons. Here's a brief look at why Guterres and others are raising the alarm now: Global politics are in dire shape \"The climate crisis, stark inequalities, conflicts and human rights violations, and the personal and economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have put our world under greater stress than it has faced in our lifetimes,\" Guterres said. The U.N. leader also highlighted Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying we are facing \"a time of nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War.\"\n\nRussia has repeatedly threatened nuclear retaliation against any country that directly interferes in his country's brutal invasion of Ukraine. Judging Russia's willingness to use a nuclear weapon, Fred Kaplan, author of The Bomb: Presidents, Generals, and the Secret History of Nuclear War, told NPR in March that \"there's a higher chance of something like that happening maybe than any time since the Cuban missile crisis.\" Nuclear arsenals are growing and being modernized The high tensions make it more likely countries will look to increase and modernize their nuclear holdings rather than reduce them, according to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, or ICAN, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017. \"At the same time, all five nuclear-armed NPT [non-proliferation treaty] member states are violating their disarmament obligations under the treaty and increasing the risk of catastrophic nuclear war,\" ICAN executive director Beatrice Fihn said in a statement about the U.N. conference. The increases in weapons stockpiles are reversing years of progress following the Cold War, Guterres said. \"States are seeking false security in stockpiling and spending hundreds of billions of dollars on doomsday weapons that have no place on our planet,\" he said, noting the prevailing atmosphere of competition and distrust.\n\n\"Almost 13,000 nuclear weapons are now being held in arsenals around the world,\" according to Guterres. Even before the Ukraine crisis, the trend was well-established and wide-ranging. Late last year, for instance, India tested a newly updated version of its nuclear-capable ballistic missile -- one of several advances in its nuclear arsenal, as noted by the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists.

Looking back, most lawmakers in Kyiv probably regret that decision, as it is unlikely Ukraine would have been invaded had it still had those weapons. Moscow wouldn't have risked a nuclear retaliatory strike, it has been argued - a point made by Jacoby and others.\n\nJust days after Jacoby's op-ed, the Union of Concerned Scientists pondered a similar question, \"Could US Nuclear Weapons Prevent an Attack on Taiwan?\" However, Gregory Kulacki, China project manager for the nonpartisan group, suggested that deploying U.S. nuclear weapons likely wouldn't prevent an attack. As he noted, \"President Truman threatened to use nuclear weapons against Chinese communist forces in Korea, but they continued to fight. President Eisenhower threatened to use nuclear weapons against mainland China during the Taiwan Strait Crisis of the 1950s. Once again, it did not deter Beijing from pursuing and obtaining its objectives.\"\n\nThis is simply because Chinese military doctrine is built around the idea that it must fight a conventional war under conditions of nuclear deterrence. In other words, China would go all in - and in a dangerous game of nuclear poker, would seek to call Washington's bluff. Beijing simply expects that the United States wouldn't go down the path of \"Nuclear Armageddon\" for an island that few Americans can place on a map.\n\nLegal Issues Get Complex\n\nNow, where the issue is a bit more murky and complex is in the fact that Taiwan is not legally recognized throughout much of the world. Currently, just 13 countries and Vatican City have recognized Taiwan as a sovereign state. In fact, just last year, Nicaragua cut ties with Taipei and recognized Beijing as the sole China.\n\nHowever, that could work in Taipei's favor should it seek to develop nuclear weapons. In 1968, Taiwan - then recognized as the Republic of China by the United Nations - signed onto the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty (NPT). After the seat for \"China\" in the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council reverted from Taipei to Beijing in 1971, the NPT, as well as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), coordinated only with Beijing.\n\nIn other words, Taiwan isn't bound by a treaty today.\n\nIn fact, from the late 1960s to the 1980s, Taipei had attempted to develop nuclear weapons. For the government in Taipei, the thinking is that such a weapon would have evened the odds, but for Beijing, it could have been a justification for an attack. Taiwan finally abandoned its efforts due to diplomatic pressure from the United States.\n\nEven today it remains unlikely that Taiwan will ever develop nuclear weapons.\n\nChinese analysts have actually suggested that having nuclear arms likely wouldn't benefit the self-governing island. As noted, Beijing could see such a deployment of such weapons as justification for war. A nuclear arsenal might not deter China as anti-ship missiles might. Moreover, a nuclear weapon would only ensure that China would hit back hard - and destroy the island nation.\n\nAs it currently stands, Beijing maintains that Taiwan is a breakaway province. The presence of nuclear weapons could make Beijing see Taiwan as a U.S. nuclear proxy that needs to be eliminated at all costs - and the Chinese Communist Party might be willing to bet that Americans wouldn't risk nuclear annihilation over an island most can't place on a map is destroyed.", "source": {"uri": "19fortyfive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "19FortyFive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_suciu@19fortyfive.com", "name": "Peter Suciu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.19fortyfive.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,height=576,fit=crop,quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect,metadata=none/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/J-20-Stealth-Fighter.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 26, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 33, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7137165238", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "16:02:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T16:02:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T15:58:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6509804129600525, "url": "https://www.npr.org/2022/08/02/1115160155/guterres-one-miscalculation-away-nuclear-annihilation", "title": "Why the U.N. chief says we are 'one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation'", "body": "The world is now enduring greater stress than any time in recent decades, according to U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. And while humanity has so far avoided \"the suicidal mistake of nuclear conflict,\" he said, tensions are hitting new highs at a time when many lessons of the past seem forgotten.\n\n\"Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,\" the world's top diplomat said at a U.N. conference on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in New York City.\n\nIt's not the first time such a dire warning has been issued about the catastrophic risks posed by nuclear weapons. Here's a brief look at why Guterres and others are raising the alarm now:\n\n\"The climate crisis, stark inequalities, conflicts and human rights violations, and the personal and economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have put our world under greater stress than it has faced in our lifetimes,\" Guterres said.\n\nThe U.N. leader also highlighted Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying we are facing \"a time of nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War.\"\n\nRussia has repeatedly threatened nuclear retaliation against any country that directly interferes in his country's brutal invasion of Ukraine.\n\nJudging Russia's willingness to use a nuclear weapon, Fred Kaplan, author of The Bomb: Presidents, Generals, and the Secret History of Nuclear War, told NPR in March that \"there's a higher chance of something like that happening maybe than any time since the Cuban missile crisis.\"\n\nThe high tensions make it more likely countries will look to increase and modernize their nuclear holdings rather than reduce them, according to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, or ICAN, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017.\n\n\"At the same time, all five nuclear-armed NPT [non-proliferation treaty] member states are violating their disarmament obligations under the treaty and increasing the risk of catastrophic nuclear war,\" ICAN executive director Beatrice Fihn said in a statement about the U.N. conference.\n\nThe increases in weapons stockpiles are reversing years of progress following the Cold War, Guterres said.\n\n\"States are seeking false security in stockpiling and spending hundreds of billions of dollars on doomsday weapons that have no place on our planet,\" he said, noting the prevailing atmosphere of competition and distrust.\n\n\"Almost 13,000 nuclear weapons are now being held in arsenals around the world,\" according to Guterres.\n\nEven before the Ukraine crisis, the trend was well-established and wide-ranging. Late last year, for instance, India tested a newly updated version of its nuclear-capable ballistic missile -- one of several advances in its nuclear arsenal, as noted by the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists.\n\nGuterres is poised to travel to Hiroshima this weekend to mark the anniversary of the world's first nuclear attack, by the U.S. on Japan.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who is from Hiroshima, addressed the U.N. conference on Monday, calling on all nuclear-armed countries to act responsibly.\n\nKishida voiced Japan's support for U.S.-Russia talks on potential stockpile reductions, and he said his country \"encourages the U.S. and China to engage in a bilateral dialogue on nuclear arms control and disarmament.\"\n\nKishida brought with him a folded paper crane, an homage to Sasaki Sadako, the Japanese girl who survived the Hiroshima attack when she was two years old but died of leukemia 10 years later. Her origami cranes have become a symbol of the wish to live without the threat of nuclear war.\n\nSince the first U.N. non-proliferation conference in 1975, the roughly month-long meetings have normally been held every five years.

Opening the Conference, US President Joe Biden emphasised how a \"nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought\", calling for \"substantive engagement on arms control and nuclear non-proliferation.\" Yet, questions of a revival of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) remain unanswered, as the five-year anniversary of the US withdrawal from the deal approaches next year, and US-Iranian dialogue has hitherto not borne fruit. Moreover, only sixty-six states are party the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, established in 2017, the latest being Malawi, which ratified the Treaty in June 2022. Neither the five legal nuclear weapons states nor their allies show much compulsion to join the world's first binding agreement urging the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons.\n\nCleavages in the global nuclear order seem to be exacerbating, in no small part due to North Korea's actions. The tenth RevCon comes at a far from jubilant moment. The last two such occasions, in 2010 and 2015, left a sour legacy, reinforcing the non-proliferation regime's inability to reach any consensus on addressing the growing threats posed by horizontal and vertical nuclear proliferation. Although Pyongyang infamously expressed dissatisfaction at the indefinite renewal of the Non-Proliferation Treaty at the RevCon in 1995, it has successfully exploited the fragilities in the global nuclear order in the early 21 century, to continue its nuclear development unconstrained by the non-proliferation regime.\n\nWill August's RevCon have any real impact on a state from whom nuclear weapons are not just dreams but visible realities? Despite RevCon's seeming obsession with denuclearisation, is denuclearisation really feasible with respect to North Korea? Alternatively, should the international community move to an approach of \"threat reduction\", amidst given growing rumours of possible nuclearisation of South Korea and Japan? This year's NATO Strategic Concept explicitly mentioned North Korea by name, deeming its nuclear and chemical weapons programmes a \"threat to our security\". Yet, if Pyongyang will never \"barter the security and dignity of the state...for anything else\", as Kim Jong Un mentioned in December 2019, should the international community aim for a more concerted approach towards smaller steps to reducing the North Korean nuclear threat?\n\nPrevious RevCons have been notorious for raising hopes that are then quickly dashed. Each time, NPT signatories have failed to reach an actionable and consensual plan towards addressing threats to the global nuclear order. Each time, North Korea has emerged victorious, with a strengthened self-belief as a state that had nuclearised having withdrawn - even if under questionable terms - from the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003. In March 2005, two months before that year's Review Conference, the DPRK's Foreign Ministry announced, for the first time, that North Korea was a \"full-fledged nuclear state\", an announcement that would seem dubious after the low yield of its first nuclear test on 9 October the following year. Nevertheless, since that first nuclear test, the story is well-known: not even a pandemic could stop Pyongyang from expanding the sophistication and range of its nuclear and missile capabilities. In 2018, Kim Jong Un's claim that the DPRK no longer needed to test nuclear or long-range missiles, having reached the status of a \"full-fledged nuclear state\", was one that the regime could assert with greater confidence than in 2005. This year, on 24 March, the self-imposed moratorium of 2018 would be broken, as the North launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for the first time since 2017, albeit not the Hwasong-17 ICBM that the regime initially announced.\n\nThis year's RevCon comes at a time of precarity in the Northeast Asian region. Former UK National Security Adviser, Sir Stephen Lovegrove, recently warned of a \"dangerous new age of proliferation\" spearheaded by China's expanding conventional, missile, and nuclear capabilities, and as North Korea's intention on gaining international recognition as a de facto nuclear state heightens. Marking the 69 anniversary of the Korean War ceasefire, Kim Jong Un warned how the strengthening of the US-ROK alliance is raising tensions on the Peninsula to \"the brink of war\". In response to the pledge by Washington and Seoul, in May, to upgrade US-ROK ties to a \"comprehensive strategic alliance\", Kim underscored the North's readiness to face any \"confrontation\" with the US, and threatened how South Korean President, Yoon Suk-yeol, and his \"military gangsters\" would be \"wiped out\" if any confrontation occurred.\n\nIn May 2017, a preparatory committee for the 2020 RevCon, including the United States, South Korea, and Japan - but unsurprisingly, not China - endorsed a statement condemning Pyongyang's nuclear and missile development, urging the DPRK to \"return to the [Non-Proliferation] Treaty and the International Atomic Energy safeguards at an early date and abandon its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programme in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.\" Those were the days of the early Trump administration, whose emphasis on complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement (CVID) would continue even amidst the unsuccessful leader-to-leader summitry with Kim Jong Un in 2018 and 2019. Central to these summits' lack of success was how denuclearisation was a starting point for discussion, immediately lowering the North's incentive to offer any nuclear concessions, however paltry.\n\nA nuclear North Korea is now little short of a fait accompli for the international community. Given this pessimistic possibility, would a more feasible approach be one of threat reduction? Threat reduction involves avoiding further expansion in the range and sophistication of North Korean nuclear and missile capabilities; limiting Pyongyang's existing arsenal; and rebuilding trust. Could the opening of liaison offices in Washington and Pyongyang offer one possible solution? Whilst this strategy tried and failed - owing to North Korea's obstruction of talks - in the 1990s, North Korea in 2022 is not the same as thirty years ago. An additional, longer-term aim of threat reduction could involve North Korea abandoning its nuclear aspirations in favour of a latent nuclear capability, akin to Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.\n\nYet threat reduction, whereby denuclearisation is no longer a starting point, also carries risks: first, the North Korean regime has - ever since first nuclear crisis of the 1990s, if not beforehand - defined its capabilities as a warranted response to what it perceives as a seemingly never-ending \"hostile policy\" emanating from the United States and its allies. Secondly, in response to an overt declaration of \"threat reduction\" compared to \"denuclearisation\", North Korea may, in fact, markedly accelerate its nuclear development. Questions of South Korea developing an independent nuclear deterrent, even if in violation of its own NPT obligations, are thus raised.\n\nIn 1999, the conclusion of the Perry Review, a review of US policy towards North Korea conducted by former US Secretary of Defence, William Perry, poignantly stated how the world should deal with North Korea \"as it is, not how we want it to be.\" As the likelihood of learning to live with a nuclear North Korea only increases, it is time for the nuclear non-proliferation regime to rethink how it deals with its once-former member.", "source": {"uri": "ispionline.it", "dataType": "news", "title": "ISPI"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.ispionline.it/sites/default/files/field/image/north_korea_missile.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 28, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 41, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7136809397", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "11:05:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T11:05:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T11:05:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "url": "https://iflscience.com/humanity-is-one-miscalculation-away-from-nuclear-annihilation-warns-un-chief-64708", "title": "Humanity Is \"One Miscalculation Away From Nuclear Annihilation,\" Warns UN Chief", "body": "In today's news, the nuclear self-annihilation of humanity may be closer than you think!

North Korea ditched the deal in 2003 and India, Israel, and Pakistan have not signed on to it.\n\nIn a joint statement Monday, CodePink and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom U.S. Section (WILPF U.S.) urged the Biden administration \"to remove its nuclear weapons from NATO countries and its anti-ballistic missiles from Romania and Poland, to dismantle its land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), to take all nuclear-armed missiles off hair-trigger alert, and reverse course on nuclear rearmament.\"\n\nCodePink and WILPF U.S. demanded the declassification of the Biden administration's nuclear policy document and noted that leaders use the term \"modernization\" for arsenal updates -- which the groups called \"a euphemism designed to disguise violations\" of the NPT. They also acknowledged how Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the response by the United States and other NATO nations have heightened global fears of nuclear war.\n\nWhile the pair objected to the deployment of American nuclear weapons to several nations -- including Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the U.K. -- they specifically pointed out that anti-ballistic missiles in Poland and Romania \"escalate the arms race, sending a message that the U.S. and its NATO allies could launch a first strike on Russia protected from retaliation.\"\n\n\"At this tenuous time, the U.S. government is engaged in a protracted proxy war with Russia,\" the organizations said. \"We at CodePink and WILPF U.S. raise our voices in thunderous protest at this warmongering and say steps must be taken to de-escalate the crisis.\"\n\nThe groups blasted not only President Joe Biden and others in his administration, but also members of Congress who are backing an $839 billion military budget. As they put it: \"Instead of pursuing world peace and climate preservation for our children and their children, leaders of the U.S. are chasing a reckless and provocative foreign policy that pits the two most heavily armed nuclear nations, the U.S. and Russia, against each other, in an existential threat to humankind.\"\n\n\"Much as we condemn Russia's horrific invasion and brutal occupation of Ukraine, we acknowledge our part in this -- with U.S. and NATO provocations -- and we protest our government's decision to escalate the war with billions of dollars in weapons and military training rather than efforts to reach a negotiated settlement to build a new security architecture for Europe that will guarantee security to all in the region,\" CodePink and WILPF U.S. added.\n\nMeanwhile, \"Russia is threatening to deploy new strategic systems, including a nuclear-armed torpedo,\" and Russian President Vladimir Putin \"recently suggested he might put nuclear weapons-capable missiles and aircraft in Belarus,\" the pair also highlighted. Additionally, other nuclear powers -- specifically China and the U.K. -- are dumping money into replacing and upgrading \"their deadly arsenals.\"\n\nThe International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) on Monday similarly called out multiple countries, emphasizing in a statement that the United Nations conference in NYC \"takes place amid a rapidly deteriorating international security environment,\" with nuclear-armed nations \"increasing risks of use and proliferation of nuclear weapons.\"\n\n\"Russia's invasion of Ukraine under cover of the threat to use nuclear weapons has fractured the NPT community, heightened the risks of nuclear weapons being used, and increased the likelihood of nuclear proliferation,\" said ICAN executive director Beatrice Fihn. \"At the same time, all five nuclear-armed states are violating their disarmament obligations under the treaty and increasing the risk of catastrophic nuclear war.\"\n\n\"Russia's nuclear threats have shown us the true nature of nuclear 'deterrence': intimidation, coercion, and facilitating illegal aggression,\" she continued. \"This could drive other countries to consider nuclear weapons to defend themselves against nuclear-armed aggressors.\"\n\nICAN noted with alarm developments involving three countries that have no nukes of their own but are party to the NPT: Belarus offering to host Russian arms, and Sweden and Finland stating \"publicly that they now support these weapons of mass destruction as a crucial part of their security policy and would be willing to participate in using them as part of their NATO membership application.\"\n\n\"These developments are extremely dangerous and undermine confidence in the NPT as a tool for enhancing global security,\" Fihn asserted, warning that \"if Russia or any other nuclear-armed state were to use nuclear weapons, it would have catastrophic humanitarian consequences that would harm people all over the world.\"", "source": {"uri": "wallstreetwindow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WallStreetWindow"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 15, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 22, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7140624901", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-05", "time": "08:27:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-05T08:27:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-05T08:27:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "url": "https://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsiaeas-grossi-addresses-npt-review-conference-9905364", "title": "IAEA's Grossi addresses NPT review conference", "body": "Addressing the opening session of the Tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said: \"We cannot build a more secure world with more nuclear weapons in existing arsenals and if more countries seek to acquire them.\" His ten-minute address, covered global threats to international security, the growing role low-carbon nuclear power is expected to play in meeting the world's energy and climate needs, the threats to nuclear safety in the war in Ukraine and the use of nuclear technologies for peaceful purposes globally.\n\nThe NPT has the largest membership of any arms control agreement with 191 state parties (there are four non-party states, India, Israel, Pakistan, and South Sudan, with North Korea having initiated a withdrawal procedure in Jan. 2003). The NPT parties gather every five years to review the treaty's operation and implementation of obligations. IAEA plays a significant role in the Treaty's implementation. Through inspections and other activities, it verifies that states do not divert nuclear facilities and material to military use, while facilitating the use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes in many areas, including health, food security, and environmental protection.\n\nGrossi said: \"Those who truly favour effective safeguards, would never use their cooperation as a bargaining chip, or IAEA inspectors as pawns in a political game.\" He urged all countries that had not yet done so to ratify the latest and most up-to-date legal instruments, enabling the IAEA to fully carry out its nuclear verification mission. \"A safeguards regime, reinforced by the additional protocol and the amended small quantities protocol, can give us all the trust and confidence we need that States using nuclear energy for the wellbeing of their people, are not hiding anything.\"\n\nOn the status of nuclear verification in Iran he said: \"If we are to offer credible assurances that Iran's sizable and growing nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes, Iran must grant IAEA inspectors access commensurate to the size of that programme and provide us complete information.\"\n\nThe growing role of nuclear power makes the work of the IAEA in nuclear safety and security ever more important, he noted. \"Nuclear is safer than it has ever been. But we are being tested once again. This time by war. War in Ukraine is threatening one of the world's biggest nuclear power programmes,\" he said. He added that IAEA's seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety and security are being violated, particularly at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, currently under Russian occupation. \"While this war rages on, inaction is unconscionable. If an accident occurs at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, we will not have a natural disaster to blame.

Russian President Vladimir Putin brandished his country's massive nuclear arsenal when he launched his unwarranted and illegal attack on Ukraine. For their part, the US and the UK announced an agreement with Australia that is likely to include the transfer of highly enriched uranium (HEU) to support a new nuclear attack submarine program in Canberra, despite the fact that both countries have committed within the G-7 to reduce the use of UAE throughout the world. These developments follow the relentless unraveling of crucial agreements, such as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran and the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, during the last US administration, in 2018 and 2019 respectively.\n\nIn such an environment, the last major crisis between the US and North Korea in 2017 now seems like history. That year, North Korea crossed important technical thresholds in its nuclear program, thresholds that the US intelligence community had feared would be reached in the mid-1990s. Kim Jong Un, the third supreme leader of the Kim dynasty in North Korea, finished the work carried out by his father and grandfather over more than four decades: he carried out the first test in history with an intercontinental ballistic missile and tested a thermonuclear weapon with a yield explosive of hundreds of kilotons. After that, in November 2017, he declared his nuclear deterrence \"complete\" and turned to diplomacy with South Korea and the US after his 2018 New Year's speech. The last months of 2017 became dangerous due to then US President Donald Trump's threats to attack North Korea.\n\nWhat changed in 2017 was the appearance for the US of a third nuclear-armed adversary capable of threatening its territory (the 48 contiguous federal states on continental soil) with a nuclear attack. Technical experts discussed the ins and outs of North Korea's missile technology, including its reliability. However, the North Koreans, regarding the theory of deterrence, have seemed to align with Thomas Schelling, who argued that deterrence could be obtained under ambiguous conditions and capabilities, as opposed to Albert Wohlstetter, for whom the \"balance of terror\" underpinning deterrence was delicate and would require a large number of highly reliable capabilities. What gave Kim the confidence to declare his deterrence \"complete\" after just three ICBM tests in 2017 and six nuclear tests between 2006 and 2017 was not that those capabilities had been perfected or were considered highly reliable. ; it was the notion, in line with Schelling, that Pyongyang's possession of such capabilities would endow any future crisis with the US with an undeniable nuclear dimension. No US president could consider an attack on North Korea with the certainty that Pyongyang would not be capable of launching a nuclear warhead against Washington DC or New York. As much as presidential advisers claimed that the probability of a successful North Korean detonation on US soil was in the low single digits in a crisis, any US president would think long and hard before escalating against Pyongyang. After all, high-consequence events, even if they have minimal chances of materializing, tend to induce caution.\n\nThat change in 2017 marked a new experience for almost two generations of US military officials and planners. Not since Mao Zedong first tested the Chinese DF-5 intercontinental ballistic missile in 1971 has the US policy-making community faced a new adversary armed with nuclear weapons and developing the ability to reach its home turf. In the forty-six years between 1971 and 2017, the US thought about nuclear deterrence in the context of Russia and China. Iran and North Korea were causes for concern, but were largely thought of as nuclear proliferators and \"rogue states\". If we jump to 2022, we see that the situation has largely not changed. Even though North Korea has massively produced ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads (something Kim called for during his 2018 New Year's speech, the very one that opened the door to diplomacy with South Korea), the world continues to treat Korea of the North as a proliferator rather than a possessor of nuclear weapons. The consequences of this framework may be dire in the long run, as the world fails to understand the importance of risk reduction with North Korea.\n\nThe proliferative framework regarding the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula dates back to the early 1990s, when US intelligence services first offered assessments that Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea, was trying to get the bomb. Under Soviet pressure, Kim had agreed to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The USSR, a major source of patronage for North Korea, would cease to exist six years after North Korea's accession to the treaty in 1985. The NPT, a cornerstone of the global nuclear order, offered its signatories a simple deal: letting Leaving aside the five states that had detonated a nuclear explosive device before January 1, 1967 (USA, USSR, France, UK and China), all would give up nuclear weapons in exchange for access to nuclear trade and civil nuclear technologies. For their part, the five nuclear-armed States would work in good faith to achieve global disarmament.\n\nNorth Korea has probably never fully accepted this view. If there is a state in the international system that interprets the world order in a classical neorealist sense, it is North Korea. Global institutions are of little use to Pyongyang in a world where all countries, large and small, must do what is necessary to survive under a logic of self-help. And so, although receiving Soviet patronage was useful during the cold war, the collapse of the USSR forced drastic measures. Kim Il Sung was already fascinated with the effects of nuclear weapons in the late 1950s; he also spoke of nuclear threats after the Cuban missile crisis. In the early 1990s, North Korea's interest in nuclear weapons could finally be backed by an indigenous capability: it had a working graphite-gas reactor and two more under construction.\n\nIn 1992, the two Koreas, shortly after entering the UN together, sealed an agreement for the \"denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\" That language, which is still part of the international diplomatic lexicon about the Korean peninsula, referred not only to concern about a North Korean nuclear weapon, but also to US nuclear weapons on South Korean soil. In December 1991, the last US tactical nuclear weapon left the Korean peninsula. These weapons had been deployed on South Korean soil since 1958 to deter the numerically superior North Korean military from resuming the Korean War, which ended with an armistice in 1953. The 1992 joint declaration on denuclearization provided another basis to ensure the non-nuclear status of both Koreas, something that quickly ran into difficulties in the first major crisis between the US and North Korea in 1993-1994. That crisis ultimately led to the Agreed Framework, a landmark agreement that was successful in that it delayed North Korea's plutonium production for some eight years, until it fell apart during the presidency of George W. Bush, when made it clear that Pyongyang had pursued a uranium enrichment capability, thereby opening a second pathway to the bomb.\n\nSince then, there have been two other noteworthy diplomatic episodes with North Korea. In the first place, in the mid-2000s and until 2009, the multilateral process of the Dialogue of the Six took place. Those talks led to deals and even the dismantling of some North Korean facilities, but largely fizzled out as Kim Jong Il's health worsened and his succession worries increased. In 2009, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the global nuclear watchdog agency tasked with enforcing the verification and monitoring provisions of the NPT, left North Korea for the last time and has not returned since. In December 2011, a new young leader, Kim Jong Un, took over from his father. Under Kim Jong Un, there would be no serious diplomatic efforts until 2018, when the historic summit between Kim and US President Donald Trump took place in Singapore. This was not a non-proliferation expert and he didn't seem to care too much if Kim gave up his weapons. That summit was, rather, a way to defuse the tensions of the 2017 crisis and for the president, a former reality star, to get a brief rebound in audience among the American public. The baseless Trump-Kim diplomacy collapsed at a second summit in February 2019, when the US refused to offer North Korea sanctions relief in exchange for anything short of complete capitulation and disarmament. something that the North Koreans, like any self-respecting weapons power, could not accept.\n\nThis grim history has left us with little to show for thirty years of efforts to roll back North Korea's nuclear program. Currently, such a program runs without limits, and the only obstacle to the pace and scale of the country's nuclear development is its international isolation under economic sanctions. During the covid pandemic, North Korea has isolated itself from the world, worried about the devastating effect the pandemic would have on its limited health infrastructure. In so doing, she has sanctioned herself more strongly than the outside world could hope for. Still, that hasn't done much to slow the pace of its nuclear and missile development. In 2021, Kim Jong Un spoke at the 8th congress of the Labor Party, which governs the country, and outlined a comprehensive program to modernize its nuclear forces. Among other capabilities, Kim called for multi-warhead-capable ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles, long-range cruise missiles and tactical nuclear weapons. Those statements dismantled the illusions that still sustain much of the international policy towards North Korea: it is no longer a problem of proliferation, but a problem of deterrence. In relation to the disarmament of North Korea, it is possible to speak in the same terms as in relation to the disarmament of the other eight possessors of nuclear weapons in the world.\n\nIn the year since the remarks at the 8th Labor Party Congress, Kim has shown that his ambitions are credible. He has overseen tests of new hypersonic weapons and has unveiled a new cruise missile. The Biden administration has largely failed to make North Korea a priority. Faced with a difficult international environment, the US administration has found itself (understandably) putting out fires in Eastern Europe and Afghanistan. In Asia, he continues to keep an eye on China. All of this is good news for Kim Jong Un. Although the pandemic and the economic difficulties caused by it in the country present Kim with the most problematic internal context since he came to power, the international context is perhaps the most propitious that he has ever had. An isolated Russia under Putin is unlikely to show much interest in pressuring North Korea, and China's envoy for Korean Peninsula affairs has advocated bringing \"legitimate security concerns\" into international politics. from Pyongyang. Both Moscow and Beijing have also called for sanctions relief against North Korea; in 2017, before relations with the US seriously deteriorated, both countries allowed the imposition of new sanctions when North Korea conducted its major weapons tests.\n\nDiplomacy with North Korea doesn't look like it will resume anytime soon. Kim's current military modernization drive will have to run its course (as will the pandemic) before the North Koreans feel they have enough leverage to return to the negotiating table. Meanwhile, nuclear risks on the Korean peninsula remain high. In dealing with a nuclear-armed North Korea, focus must be on managing the problem, deterring aggression, and reducing risks. The disarmament of Pyongyang, while a desirable goal, is no longer realistic in the short term. What we are left with is coexistence with a nuclear-armed North Korea: a dangerous coexistence, to be sure. It is time to accept the reality that thirty years of efforts to denuclearize the Korean peninsula have reached an impasse.\n\nAnkit Panda is Stanton Senior Fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the

Hua shot down the call for nuclear talks amid a wider uproar over Pelosi's travel plans, as the California Democrat refused to change her itinerary in the face of ominous official and propaganda statements that Chinese forces would retaliate in some fashion if she continued the visit.\n\n\"The U.S. has been following a strategy of using Taiwan to contain China,\" she said, per the official transcript. \"Any countermeasure to be taken by China would be a justified and necessary response to the U.S. oblivion to China's repeated d\u00e9marches and the U.S.'s unscrupulous behavior.\"\n\nUS AND JAPAN MOVE TOWARD FOUNDING OF 'ECONOMIC NATO' TO COUNTER CHINA\n\nHua delivered that protest, as a Chinese state media outlet emphasized, during her first appearance at the daily press briefing since \"February 24, when Russia's military operation in Ukraine started.\" Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio -- who aired his \"strong sense of urgency that Ukraine today, maybe East Asia tomorrow\" at a security conference in June -- traveled to New York to participate in a conference reviewing the efficacy of the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, known as the NPT.\n\n\"While the number has significantly decreased since the peak of the Cold War ... maintaining this decreasing trend is extremely important in getting closer to a world without nuclear weapons,\" the Japanese leader told the United Nations in a Monday speech. \"In this vein, Japan supports the dialogue conducted between the United States and Russia for further reduction and encourages the U.S. and China to engage in a bilateral dialogue on nuclear arms control and disarmament.\"\n\nHis statement brightened the spotlight on China's nuclear arsenal at a conference otherwise haunted by Russia's nuclear threats.\n\n\"Any country that asks others to reject the pursuit of nuclear weapons also has to be willing to reduce -- and eventually, eliminate -- their own stockpiles of nuclear weapons,\" Blinken said in his appearance at the conference. \"We stand ready to work with all partners, including China and others, on risk reduction and strategic stability efforts. As we look to the future, we also have to strengthen agreements preventing nuclear conflict -- and create new ones.\"\n\nChinese officials have refused to contemplate restrictions on their burgeoning nuclear arsenal for years. And Beijing has touted the modernizing Chinese forces in an attempt to curtail U.S. government contacts with Taiwan, which the Chinese Communist regime regards as its sovereign territory, despite never managing to exert authority on the island.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"Making themselves an enemy of the 1.4 billion Chinese people will not end up well,\" Hua wrote on Twitter. \"Acting like a bully in front of the whole world will only make everyone see that the US is the biggest danger to world peace.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_gehrke@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Joel Gehrke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4365f9d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2813+0+260/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmediadc-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F81%2Fbd%2Fc2f885584e2eb58925ce424b8af5%2Fhua.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 17, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 22, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7136263249", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "00:45:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T00:45:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T00:30:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.615686297416687, "url": "https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-latest-know-003003333.html", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 160 of the invasion", "body": "The United Nations chief has warned that nuclear annihilation is just one miscalculation away.

State parties to the NPT gather every five years in New York to review the landmark, 50-year-old treaty, and the implementation of its provisions: Preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, destroying existing nuclear arsenals to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free world, and promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\n\nThe last review took place in 2015, the year the Iran Nuclear Deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was signed. The current summit was supposed to take place in 2020, but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAl-Wasil, who was elected vice president of the conference, said his country ascribed great importance to the NPT as a cornerstone treaty aimed at creating a world free of nuclear weapons. Saudi support for the treaty proceeds from the Kingdom's belief that only peaceful cooperation between nations can lead to prosperity and stability.\n\nThe 1995 NPT Review Conference adopted a resolution on the Middle East, calling on states to take practical steps towards the establishment of the Middle East Weapon of Mass Destruction Free Zone. Member agreement was seen as key to securing the indefinite extension of the NPT.\n\nThe 1995 resolution on the Middle East remains valid until its objectives are realized, said Al-Wasil, stressing the collective responsibility of freeing the Middle East from nuclear weapons, while reiterating the Kingdom's steadfast opposition to the proliferation of such weapons.\n\nAl-Wasil thanked Kuwait for presiding over the second session of the Conference on Establishing a Nuclear-Weapons Free Zone in the Middle East, convened under the aegis of the UN, based on the 1995 NPT resolution, which aimed at negotiating a binding treaty toward that goal.\n\nHe reiterated his country's regret that the 2012 conference, called for by the Middle East plan of action in the final outcome document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference, was never convened, stressing that such a decision now represents \"one of the solutions that the international community is expected to activate in light of the failure of other international frameworks, in particular the JCPOA, to deter Iran from practices that threaten non-proliferation in the region.\"\n\nAnother obstacle to achieving the universality of the NPT is Israel's continued refusal to join the treaty, said Al-Wasil.\n\n\"This cannot be overlooked, because one of the pillars of the NPT is that it provides non-nuclear states with security safeguards against the use of atomic energy for non-peaceful purposes,\" he said. \"This guarantee is still missing in the Middle East so long as Israel refuses to join the treaty and subject all its nuclear facilities to the IAEA safeguards regime, ignoring the resolutions of the NPT Review Conferences.\"\n\nAl-Wasil also voiced his appreciation for the IAEA and its director general for their efforts in improving the agency's capabilities to enhance its role in verifying and monitoring the integrity of state parties' nuclear programs.\n\nThe Saudi envoy also spoke of states' right to develop peaceful nuclear programs, reaffirming his country's commitment to a national policy that emphasizes the highest standards of transparency and reliability in the development of atomic energy for civilian purposes.\n\nHe also stressed the importance of compliance of all state parties with all the provisions of the NPT, and the placement of all nuclear facilities under the IAEA's safeguard system for atomic energy.", "source": {"uri": "arabnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/main-image/2022/08/04/3371011-1978572666.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 15, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 20, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7136420096", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "04:56:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T04:56:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T04:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "url": "https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220802000566", "title": "South Korea condemns North for 'abusing' NPT regime, urges to cease provocations", "body": "Ham Sang-wook, Deputy Minister for Multilateral and Global Affairs of South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, addresses the 10th Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in New York on Monday.(Yonhap)\n\nSouth Korea strongly condemned the North for \"abusing\" the Non-Proliferation Treaty to openly develop nuclear weapons and urged the regime to dialogue for complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization during international nuclear arms talks.\n\nAddressing the 10th NPT Review Conference held at the UN headquarters in New York on Monday, Korean Deputy Minister for Multilateral and Global Affairs of Foreign Ministry Ham Sang-wook said the non-proliferation goal is being challenged amid growing threats from non-member states and delivered Seoul's unwavering commitment to strengthening the NPT regime.\n\n\"While relentlessly developing nuclear and missile programs, the DPRK has been launching ballistic missiles at an unprecedented frequency, 31 this year alone, in flagrant violation of the UN Security Council resolutions,\" Ham Sang-wook, Deputy Minister for Multilateral and Global Affairs of South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said during the general session.

The last nuclear test was in September 2017.\n\nAt the review conference, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also expressed concerns about threats posed by North Korea and Iran and stressed the importance of the NPT. The top US diplomat also called out Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, and for engaging in \"reckless, dangerous nuclear saber-rattling\" to violate multiple international agreements, including the UN Charter.\n\n\"And so we come together at a critical moment. The DPRK continues to expand its unlawful nuclear program and continues its ongoing provocations against the region,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"As we gather today, Pyongyang is preparing to conduct its seventh nuclear test. Iran remains on a path of nuclear escalation.\n\nBefore the conference opened, the US issued a joint ministerial statement with France, Britain and Northern Ireland to condemn Russia, Iran and the United States for creating military tension.\n\n\"Nuclear weapons, for as long as they exist, should serve defensive purposes, deter aggression, and prevent war,\" the statement reads.\n\n\"We condemn those who would use or threaten to use nuclear weapons for military coercion, intimidation, and blackmail. Such actions are profoundly dangerous and contrary to the purposes of the NPT and the UN Charter.\"\n\nCriticizing Russia's invasion of Ukraine as \"unlawful,\" the countries called for Russia to stop its \"irresponsible and dangerous nuclear rhetoric and behavior\" and to adhere to its international commitments.\n\nThey also reiterated their commitment to bring \"complete, verifiable and irreversible\" dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear weapons, and urged Pyongyang to cease all of its nuclear tests and ballistic missiles that are banned by multiple UN Security Council resolutions.\n\nOn the sidelines of the main session, Korea's Foreign Ministry hosted \"North Korea: Addressing the Nuclear Challenge\" at the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Korea to the United Nations in New York, together with the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nSome 70 people from permanent missions to the UN and delegates to the NPT Review Conferences attended the event.

This is the second installment in a three-part series.\n\n\u203b\u203b\u203b\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida's drive to tackle nuclear issues can be traced back to the tragedy inflicted by the U.S. atomic bombings, the effects of which have been drilled into him since infancy.\n\nKishida, 65, was born on July 29, 1957, in Tokyo, the eldest son of Fumitake Kishida, a bureaucrat of the then Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Every summer Kishida would visit Hiroshima, his father's hometown, and whenever the Aug. 6 Peace Memorial Ceremony drew near, his grandmother Kazuko would recount the experiences of victims of the atomic bombings.\n\nMany of his relatives were exposed to radiation from the atomic bomb. Setsuko Thurlow, 90, is a distant relative of Kishida's and a victim of the Hiroshima atomic bombing who lives in Canada. Thurlow works with the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), a coalition of civil society organizations calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons.\n\nICAN promotes the implementation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which comprehensively prohibits nuclear weapons, including the development and possession of such weapons. The organization received the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nWhile Kishida continues to bear with him the experiences of the victims of the Hiroshima atomic bombing, he faces a hard choice between his ideal of realizing a \"nuclear weapons-free world\" and the reality of Japan having to rely on the U.S. nuclear umbrella for nuclear deterrence.\n\nIn connection with the nuclear weapons ban treaty, Kishida, as foreign minister in October 2016, briefly revealed an eagerness to take part in the treaty negotiations, saying, \"I would like to proactively take part and assert what we should assert.\"\n\nBut the United States called on its allied nations not to take part in the negotiations, on the grounds that the negotiations would decisively pit those countries with nuclear weapons against those with no such weapons. Then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe thus decided to forgo Japan's participation in the negotiations.\n\nEventually, Kishida had to compromise by having Nobushige Takamizawa attend as disarmament ambassador only the first day of negotiations in March 2017 to express Japan's nonparticipation.\n\n\"Kishida agonized very much over the decision as a foreign minister who was elected to represent Hiroshima,\" said Takamizawa, 66. \"He might have thought, 'It is also reasonable to take part in the negotiations from the perspective of listening to what other people have to say.'\"\n\nEven now, with the nuclear weapons ban treaty having already entered into force in January 2021, there are still unceasing calls from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the two cities struck by the U.S. nuclear bombs, for Japan to join the treaty. In the first Meeting of States Parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons held in June this year, a conference held after Kishida took office, Germany participated as an observer, while the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki gave speeches.\n\nBut Kishida refrained from dispatching a government official to the meeting. Within the Japanese government, there runs a broad vein of distrust toward ICAN, which has called on Japan to participate in the meetings. As a senior Foreign Ministry official put it, \"ICAN turns a blind eye on the harsh security environment in Asia, while it carries on with repeated criticisms of Japan alone.\"\n\nAn expert on nuclear issues pointed out, \"ICAN has a huge limitation in that it cannot convey its message to autocratic states, such as China and North Korea, where there are no civil society organizations to cooperate with it.\"\n\nGermany does not have nuclear weapons but continues to participate in the nuclear sharing program of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization through which it can employ U.S. nuclear weapons deployed on its soil in times of emergency. As Germany has been engaged more deeply than Japan in the nuclear deterrence system, Berlin's relationship with Washington has not been shaken even after its participation in the Meeting of States Parties as an observer.\n\nA special envoy from Germany also made clear at the meeting that the nation cannot join the nuclear weapons ban treaty because participation in it runs counter to the country's position as a NATO member state.\n\nTo reduce nuclear arms, it is vital to persuade nuclear nations, among which the United States, the United Kingdom and France all have the patential to listen to Japan's entreaties. Kishida, through these three countries, even intends to try to persuade China and Russia.\n\nSpeaking of Japan's participation in the nuclear weapons ban treaty, a former foreign minister belonging to the Liberal Democratic Party said dismissively: \"The U.S., U.K. and France would turn their backs on Japan. We could lose those channels. There would be no merit whatsoever.\"\n\n\"In any case, I will take a realistic approach,\" Kishida has reportedly told those close to him. He appears poised to seek steady progress in nuclear disarmament, toward the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons.", "source": {"uri": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp", "dataType": "news", "title": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Gensuikyo.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 6, "stanza_neu": 29, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 35, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7136819716", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "11:14:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T11:14:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T11:14:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6039215922355652, "url": "https://www.kyivpost.com/world/proliferation-of-nuclear-weapons-in-the-spotlight-again.html", "title": "Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the spotlight again - KyivPost - Ukraine's Global Voice", "body": "UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reported that the world faced a nuclear threat not seen since the height of the Cold War and warned that one miscalculation could lead to the annihilation of humanity.\n\n\"We have been extremely lucky so far.

Today, humanity is separated by one miscalculation and one misunderstanding from nuclear annihilation,\" reported Guterres. His words came at the beginning of the conference of countries participating in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\n\nThe Secretary-General named the conference a chance to strengthen the treaty and make it fit for a \"troubled world around us,\" noting Russia's war in Ukraine and tensions on the Korean peninsula and the Middle East.\n\n\"Nearly 13,000 nuclear weapons are now stored in arsenals around the world. All this at a time when the risks of its spread are growing and the barriers to prevent escalation are weakening. The elimination of nuclear weapons is the only guarantee that they will never be used,\" reported Guterres.\n\nThe Conference had been postponed several times since 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and is taking place from August 1 to 26 in New York.\n\nDuring the UN speech at the conference, the Deputy Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Mykola Tochytsky stated that the UN should make efforts to close the sky over nuclear facilities in Ukraine. He explained this necessity by the growing danger to Ukrainian nuclear power plants as a result of the Russian war, as well as Russia's blatant disregard for international treaties and nuclear security norms.\n\nIran situation\n\nChina and Russia are still interested in restoring the 2015 nuclear deal, which will enhance sanctions and decrease tensions in the region. Beijing and Moscow also have essential economic relationships with Iranian capital Tehran and stand to benefit from the stabilization of trade.\n\nChina and Russia have an active interest in the destabilizing effects of a nuclear Iran so - for them - a deal is important. Moreover, Russia and China need to balance their relationships with Iran and other Middle Eastern countries.\n\nIran stated that it had new ideas to restore its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers after the European Union's (EU) coordinator offered text to reach an agreement.\n\nOn July 25, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell reported that he had offered the text to restore the landmark accord, which the U.S. unilaterally abandoned in 2018.\n\n\"This text represents the best possible deal that I, as a facilitator of the negotiations, see as feasible.

The ongoing war in Ukraine has reasserted the relevance and role of nuclear weapons in deterring attacks and ensuring national survival. Ukraine, which once had the world's third-largest nuclear stockpiles, was invaded by Russia in February of this year, raising the question of whether Ukraine could have avoided the Russian invasion and threats to its national survival if it had not given up its nuclear arsenal.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine inherited the world's third largest nuclear stockpile including an estimated1,900 strategic warheads, 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and 44 strategic bombers. In 1994, under the Budapest agreement, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom extended security assurances to the newly independent nation of Ukraine, and Ukraine agreed to return those weapons to Russia. However, these guarantees turned out to be worthless. Given the fact that nuclear deterrence has worked in avoiding major wars and invasions for seven decades, a nuclear-armed Ukraine could likely have played a decisive role in the current Russia-Ukraine War rather the war could potentially be prevented.\n\nRead more: Russia Ukraine War: What are the lessons for Pakistan?\n\nIt is quite evident from history that states that sought to acquire nuclear weapons capability for their national security have deterred the perceived external aggressions and ultimately ensured their national survival. The ongoing crisis in Ukraine has proven that the possession of nuclear weapons by a state help deter an attack and ensures its survival in the face of aggression from a rival state and threats to territorial integrity. When a state's security and territorial integrity is threatened by the aggression of a rival state, nuclear weapons potentially ward off such episodes by threatening unacceptable retaliation to any such attack and thereby deterring rivals from invasion.\n\nThe world has already seen the direct consequences of wars that could not be averted through conventional arms. Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan are cases in point. These countries did not have nuclear weapons and suffered badly as a direct consequence of wars that resulted in regime change, mass killing of innocent citizens, and the worst economic crisis. Given these scenarios, North Korea continues to test nuclear weapons, and the US-led global efforts for denuclearization have so far come to nothing. Because the Hermit Kingdom believes that nuclear weapons provide a vigorous hedge against foreign invasion.\n\nAfter the Russian invasion, the fate of the nuclear-nonproliferation regime may be in doubt as more states may see nuclear weapons as a vital source of deterrence. They may be eying on Ukraine and conclude that how a weaker state with no security assurances is invaded by a powerful state. Also, they could be motivated by North Korea and see how even such a weaker and isolated regime could survive and gain a level of prestige by developing nuclear weapons.\n\nRead more: Western assistance or logistical nightmare for Ukraine?\n\nIt is high time that the world powers make serious efforts to bring an end to a month-long conflict, which has profound political and economic ramifications on the world. Also, they should assure Russia that its sovereignty is not in danger. This will help bring a breakthrough, thus ending the conflict and reviving peace and stability. If the conflict continues and leads to further annihilation, it could set a precedent that could be damaging to the future of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The invasion of smaller states by major powers for their strategic objectives could undermine the non-proliferation efforts by the international community, as weaker states would depend more on nuclear deterrence instead of security guarantees by major powers.", "source": {"uri": "globalvillagespace.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global Village Space"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.globalvillagespace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/US-warns-EU-that-Russia-may-be-plotting-Ukraine-invasion-Report.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 6, "stanza_neu": 17, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 26, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7139303471", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-04", "time": "08:37:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-04T08:37:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-04T07:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "url": "https://au.news.yahoo.com/n-korea-not-tolerate-us-073610709.html", "title": "N.Korea 'will not tolerate' US nuke snipes", "body": "North Korea warned it will \"never tolerate\" the United States' criticism of the isolated country's nuclear program, calling Washington the \"kingpin of nuclear proliferation\".\n\nNorth Korea has conducted missile trials at an unprecedented pace this year and international experts believe it is readying its seventh nuclear test, the first since 2017.\n\nThe North's permanent mission to the United Nations issued the statement on Wednesday as diplomats gathered in New York for a month-long UN conference to review the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during the meeting the North \"continues to expand its unlawful nuclear program\" and \"is preparing to conduct its seventh nuclear test\".\n\n\"It is the peak of busy blaming that the United States alleges somebody's 'nuclear threats' given the fact that it is the kingpin of nuclear proliferation,\" North Korea said.\n\nThe North also said it pulled out of the non-proliferation treaty a long time ago, so nobody had the right to impinge on the country's right to self-defence.\n\n\"We will never tolerate any attempt by the US and its servile forces to groundlessly accuse our state and encroach upon our sovereign rights and national interests,\" the North said in its statement.\n\nLast week, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said his country was ready to mobilise its nuclear war deterrent and counter any US military action.", "source": {"uri": "au.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!7 News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lhNilstKyqPFdS3vClpkBA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ehMIMOo4xDe5XiBzhc2mTw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aap.com.au/f9b81dc35e00cc98a61d1f805b5dd961", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 4, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 8, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7139117019", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-04", "time": "05:34:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-04T05:34:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-04T04:35:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "url": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/north-korea-says-will-never-tolerate-us-accusation-of-its-nuclear-programme", "title": "North Korea says will 'never tolerate' US accusation of its nuclear programme", "body": "SEOUL (REUTERS) -

France assumes this responsibility, and nuclear weapons must not be seen as tools of coercion or destabilization. Spotlighting the Russian Federation's strategy of intimidation in Ukraine, he stressed that \"this is not what France calls deterrence\".\n\nSimilarly, the representative of Sweden, speaking for the Stockholm Initiative for Nuclear Disarmament, stressed that -- while all States can and should help drive progress on nuclear disarmament -- nuclear-weapon States bear a special responsibility. Encouraging such States to contribute to next-generation arms-control arrangements, she also encouraged visits to -- and interaction with -- communities affected by nuclear-weapon detonations.\n\nOffering the perspective of one such community, Kiribati's representative recalled that, between 1957 and 1962, the United States and the United Kingdom conducted 33 thermonuclear tests in his country, leaving 500 of its citizens with little warning or protection. Cases of cancer, congenital disabilities and abnormalities persist today in their descendants, and he called on States to support the inclusion of victim assistance and environmental remediation in the Review Conference outcome document.\n\nThe speaker for Algeria also pointed out that tests took place on his country's territory, which is why the Government signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Algeria also ratified the Pelindaba Treaty -- which created a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa -- and he expressed concern over obstacles preventing the establishment of such a zone in the Middle East.\n\nOther delegates echoed the need for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, including those of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. Stressing that the responsibility to create such a zone is a collective one, the representative of Saudi Arabia underlined his country's support for all international efforts that seek to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons or threatening the region or the world.\n\nThe representatives of Syria and Yemen and the Permanent Observer for the State of Palestine joined others in highlighting Israel's refusal to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as another obstacle to the creation of such a zone. The latter speaker stressed that the use or threatened use of nuclear weapons has always been illegal, given that their very nature violates the fundamental principles of humanity and distinction. As such, there is also no justification for \"Israeli exceptionalism\", he stressed, adding that \"our region should be free of nuclear weapons, full stop\".\n\nThe representative of Iran said that, due to the application of double-standards in enforcing non-proliferation provisions, \"the Zionist regime's\" nuclear weapons -- developed with the United States' support -- continue to pose a serious threat to the security of countries in the Middle East. He went on to say that his country will cease its remedial actions and resume full implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action when the United States decides to assure that Iran will enjoy the economic benefits promised by that accord.\n\n\"A nuclear weapon detonation, whether by accident, design or miscalculation, can eliminate countries like Jamaica from the face of the planet,\" stressed that country's representative as the meeting drew to a close. Not only is it morally indefensible and legally irresponsible to house and spread these weapons, he said, but the vast and increasing expenditure thereon in the face of underfunded sustainable development is grossly reprehensible. Calling for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones across the world, he underscored that \"nuclear weapons should not exist in the future we want to bequeath to our children\".\n\nAlso speaking were ministers and representatives of Brazil, San Marino, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, Portugal, Egypt, Nicaragua, T\u00fcrkiye, Malta, Cyprus, Finland, Bolivia, Serbia, Senegal, Estonia, Ghana, Paraguay, Canada, Malaysia, Mongolia, Qatar, Montenegro, Belarus, Libya, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uruguay, Nigeria, Morocco, Guatemala and Lithuania.\n\nThe representatives of the Russian Federation and Ukraine also spoke in exercise of the right of reply.\n\nThe Tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Thursday, 4 August.\n\nStatements\n\nANN LINDE, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden, speaking for the Stockholm Initiative for Nuclear Disarmament, highlighted the risk of a threefold trend reversal -- in nuclear stockpile reduction, in reducing the role of nuclear weapons and in successfully containing proliferation -- and underscored that the 76-year record of the non-use of nuclear weapons must be maintained. The Initiative has presented a feasible way forward for eliminating nuclear weapons, and the 16 countries that launched it in 2019 are united in the belief that constructive political and diplomatic engagement is essential to building the trust necessary for real progress towards the shared goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. The Initiative has submitted two working papers to this conference -- Stepping Stones for Advancing Nuclear Disarmament and A Nuclear Risk Reduction Package. Detailing these papers, she said the former consists of 22 practical steps to fulfil disarmament obligations and related commitments, while the latter urges the conference to adopt concrete measures and a process for reducing the immediate threat posed by nuclear weapons use.\n\nStressing that urgent action is needed, she called for crisis-communication hotlines to be revisited and adapted to meet current and future challenges, notably the deteriorated security environment and great Power competition. She also urged a return to full implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. She encouraged visits to, and interaction with, communities affected by nuclear weapons, including Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and former nuclear test sites such as Semipalatinsk. While all States can and should help drive progress on nuclear disarmament, nuclear-weapon States bear a special responsibility. She therefore called on such States to contribute to next-generation arms-control arrangements and to positively consider the Initiative's proposals.\n\nRONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil), associating himself with the New Agenda Coalition, said one of the greatest achievements in recent years in nuclear disarmament efforts has been the 2017 adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Those who reject that Treaty are more than welcome to come up with constructive suggestions that will make the gradual approach work or to produce something better, he added. His country and others have done everything to support the gradual approach, yet those concerted efforts have yielded meagre results. Non-nuclear-weapon States contribute decisively to the non-proliferation regime, he pointed out. By example, Latin America and the Caribbean created the first nuclear-weapon-free zone in a permanently inhabited area through the entry into force of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco) and the establishment of the Organization for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean. Detailing his country's other efforts, he said the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials is at the centre of an innovative and effective verification and safeguards arrangement.\n\nPHILIPPE BERTOUX (France), associating himself with the European Union, noted his country's President, Emmanuel Macron, stated in 2020 that possessing nuclear weapons confers on those countries concerned a moral responsibility of unprecedented scope in history, and that France assumes this responsibility. Nuclear weapons must not be seen as tools of coercion or destabilization -- but in Ukraine, the Russian Federation employs a strategy of intimidation. \"This is not what France calls deterrence,\" he stressed. He further called on Iran to cease its nuclear escalation and return to cooperation with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as soon as possible, and for efforts to ensure the strict and universal implementation of the sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regime to accept dialogue and abandon its proliferation programmes. The central issue of the Review Conference is simple, he noted: to reaffirm the authority and primacy of Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, one of the fundamental pillars of strategic stability for more than 50 years. In a context of tensions over energy supplies and growing concerns about climate change and its effects, the development of nuclear energy is critical on many levels. He called on all States parties to strongly reaffirm their support for the Treaty and find common ground on concrete and realistic solutions to strengthen the non-proliferation regime.\n\nABDULAZIZ MOHAMMED O. ALWASIL (Saudi Arabia), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Arab Group, expressed concern about IAEA verification reports on Iran and that country's lack of respect and transparency with the Agency. In that regard, he underlined his country's support for all international efforts that seek to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons or threatening the region or the world. The responsibility to create a zone free from nuclear weapons in the Middle East is a collective responsibility on the international level. It is regrettable that the Review Conferences have not been able to achieve the necessary commitments to prevent the danger posed by Iran through a collective plan of action. Another grave obstacle to nuclear disarmament is Israel's continued refusal to accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, he said, noting that the aim of the Treaty is for non-nuclear-States to be able to enjoy security guarantees with respect to recourse to and use of atomic energy. Israel is refusing to accept international resolutions on this and is ignoring all recommendations and decisions from the Non-Proliferation Treaty. \"We must address the issue of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East,\" he stressed.\n\nHATEM ABDULHAMEED MOHAMED SHARIF HATEM (Bahrain), associating himself with the Arab Group and the Non-Aligned Movement, underscored the importance of the Treaty as the cornerstone of the global security architecture. Noting that Bahrain acceded to it in 1988 and is also party to the International Convention on the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, and the Convention on Nuclear Safety, he said his country also has ratified the IAEA Safeguards Agreement. Underscoring the inalienable right of States to peacefully use nuclear energy, notably in the area of health, he voiced concern over Iran's opposition to IAEA oversight of its nuclear programme and called on it to fully comply with the Agency. He also expressed hope that a nuclear-weapon-free zone will soon be established in the Middle East.\n\nNATASCIA BARTOLINI (San Marino), aligning herself with the European Union, voiced concern over growing nuclear competition and stressed that a new nuclear arms race must be avoided. Urging all parties to refrain from escalating tensions further, she also underlined the need for progress in the reduction of nuclear weapons stockpiles. Unfortunately, there has been no concrete progress on nuclear disarmament since the last Review Conference. All States parties must fully implement their commitments under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Highlighting the present dangers of malfunction and miscalculation, she also expressed concern over any possible accidental or unintended nuclear-weapon detonation. Such an event would result in irreversible, catastrophic damage to human health, the environment and socioeconomic development. It is in the interest of the very survival of humanity that nuclear weapons should never be used again, she emphasized, underscoring that: \"Ultimately, disarmament is everyone's responsibility.\" A meaningful outcome document would represent a \"remarkable step towards our common goals\", she added.\n\nYOSEPH KASSAYE (Ethiopia), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group, said the world is confronted with grave concerns in non-proliferation and disarmament due to geopolitical tensions and erosion of security arrangements. That said, Africa remains the only region with a nuclear-weapon-free zone, with the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of Pelindaba) ratified by 44 of its countries. That Treaty also promotes cooperation for the development and practical application of nuclear technology, and he reiterated the need to redouble international cooperation to implement the peaceful use of that technology. While Africa remains fully compliant with the Non-Proliferation Treaty, he cited the non-compliance of other States, a cause of serious concern and friction threatening humanity. Possible possession and use of nuclear weapons by non-State armed actors and terrorist groups remains a serious threat for Africa, along with the dumping of radioactive waste -- outlawed under article VI of the Treaty of Pelindaba. He called for strict safety and security measures by nuclear-weapon States to ensure that any aspect of the technology or capability does not fall into the hands of irresponsible actors, and expressed hope that the Conference will conclude with a concrete outcome.\n\nMr. BAGGNA (Burkina Faso), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Africa Group, encouraged the IAEA to continue its work to ensure access to nuclear science and technology for an effective response to the sustainable development challenges faced by Member States. He welcomed the IAEA's cooperation programme and called upon Member States to make every effort to fully comply with their voluntary contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund. He also called on States and organizations who can do so to continue or increase their funding of technical cooperation activities, stressing their importance for international peace and security. Noting that nuclear testing is also a key part of nuclear non-proliferation, he deplored the non-entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty over the last two decades following its adoption. Non-proliferation obligations must be scrupulously and universally respected, he stressed, urging all States to honour the commitments to which they acceded.\n\nEDUARDO RAMOS (Portugal), associating himself with the European Union, called for renewed efforts to implement the Treaty and render it universal and expressed support for steps taken by some nuclear weapon States to increase transparency on their nuclear capabilities and doctrines. Noting that Portugal submitted a national report on the implementation of the 2010 Action Plan, he said it includes measurable actions in support of the Treaty's three pillars. With the unprovoked, unjustified invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an \"unprecedented attack\" on the global rules-based order, leaving the nuclear security environment marked by high tensions and serious proliferation crises, which must be collectively addressed. In addition, he urged the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to engage with all parties to ensure the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Further, he said he looked forward to positive results from negotiations on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. He called on all States that have not yet joined the Treaty to adhere to its terms, likewise pressing those States that have yet to sign or ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty to do so as soon as possible.\n\nMOHAMED ENNADIR LARBAOUI (Algeria), endorsing the statements by the Non-Aligned Movement, African Group and Arab Group, recalled his country's contributions to the disarmament process, noting that it was the first to open the Conference in 1979 and chaired the Review Conference in 2000, leading to the 13 practical steps for nuclear disarmament. Algeria also chaired the first meeting of the General Assembly on the topic, and alongside Germany, co-chaired the Eleventh Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. He described the Non-Proliferation Treaty as the cornerstone of the global security regime and underscored the need for nuclear-weapon States to uphold their article VI obligations, as well as the 13 Practical Steps on Non-Proliferation and Disarmament and the 2010 Plan of Action. Recalling that tests took place on Algeria's territory, which is why the Government signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, he reaffirmed the rights of States to develop, modernize and use atomic energy for peaceful purposes, in line with article IV. Noting that Algeria ratified the Pelindaba Treaty, creating the nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa, he voiced concern over obstacles preventing implementation of a decision adopted at the 1995 Review Conference to create such a zone in the Middle East. He welcomed the Assembly's subsequent decision allowing for an annual Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction to be convened, whose second session was in November 2021, marking a first step towards achieving stability in the region.\n\nOSAMA MAHMOUD ABDEL KHALEK MAHMOUD (Egypt), associating himself with the Arab Group, African Group, Non-Aligned Movement and New Agenda Coalition, pointed out that the Non-Proliferation Treaty has not achieved universality, which raises questions regarding its ability to achieve its goals. He called on all States parties to conduct a comprehensive assessment and then agree on practical steps with which to address this situation, as the Treaty's credibility is at stake. Non-implementation of commitments made under article VI of the Treaty is one of the key challenges. Various initiatives proposed during the Conference should not be a substitute for nuclear-weapon States' compliance with their commitments. Stressing that the success of international non-proliferation efforts is linked to those aimed at disarmament, he said that some States are attempting to impose a mandatory character on certain voluntary mechanisms in a manner inconsistent with article III. This limits the rights of States parties to benefit from the peaceful use of atomic energy under article IV, he added.\n\nJAIME HERMIDA CASTILLO (Nicaragua), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement, reiterated the importance of making headway towards complete and total disarmament. He also expressed concern that nuclear-weapon States continue to modernize and develop their arsenals, hand-in-hand with dangerous military doctrines claiming to justify their use. The resources expended could be used to attain the Sustainable Development Goals -- above all, the eradication of poverty, he pointed out. He expressed regret that the international conference to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East has not been convened and noted that non-nuclear-weapon States have no guarantees on the potential use of those arms. This Conference must make progress on realistic, ambitious results, ensuring implementation of the three pillars of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in a balanced way, he stressed. Recognizing the legitimate right of all States to research, develop and peacefully use nuclear energy, he called for cooperation in scientific domains -- rejecting any attempt to politicize that right, or unilateral coercive measures restricting developing countries from exercising it. He also highlighted that Nicaragua is a member State of the world's first nuclear-weapon-free zone.\n\n\u00d6NC\u00dc KE\u00c7ELI (T\u00fcrkiye), aligning himself with the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative, expressed regret that the Review Conference is organized under extraordinary circumstances due to the invasion of Ukraine, calling for an immediate end to the war and expressing concern over the safety and security of nuclear facilities in Ukraine. He also expressed concern over the lack of progress in the implementation of commitments undertaken during previous review conferences, stressing that his country is committed to systematic, verifiable and irreversible nuclear disarmament pursuant to article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Calling on all States possessing nuclear weapons to take practical steps in this direction, he said that the Initiative's reporting template is a useful tool to measure the implementation of Treaty commitments. Further, negotiations should be commenced immediately on a treaty banning the production of fissile materials, and the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty remains a top priority. He added a call for the parties to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to fully uphold their commitments and obligations, including by allowing the IAEA to carry out monitoring and verification activities.\n\nMARK CISCALDI (Malta), associating himself with the European Union, called on States not yet party the Non-Proliferation Treaty to adhere to its terms, stressing that the disarmament architecture has significantly eroded since the last Review Conference. Describing the prospect of nuclear weapons use in the Ukraine war as \"deeply concerning\", he said \"we are witnessing an escalation of tensions unparalleled since the days of the cold war\" and urged States Parties to inject much-needed diplomatic momentum and political will into the non-proliferation and disarmament regimes. He also said he was encouraged by the entry into force of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and convening of the first meeting of States parties in June; the benefits of this humanitarian-led initiative strengthen the global norm against nuclear weapons and fills a legal gap as the first outright prohibition. However, regarding the IAEA warning that Iran's the decision to turn off 27 cameras installed to monitor enrichment activity, he said this could strike the \"fatal blow\" to efforts to restore the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. He called on Iran to reverse its decision and instead allow full, unhindered access to IAEA monitors. He also called on Syria to address its safeguards issues in full cooperation with IAEA, urging Member States to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in particular to both refrain from testing and return to IAEA safeguards.\n\nANDREAS HADJICHRYSANTHOU (Cyprus) said that like other small States, his country's security relies heavily on the international system of collective security. \"We cannot overstate the importance of ensuring that no additional States acquire nuclear weapons,\" he said, stressing that balancing the Treaty's three pillars is of primordial importance. While some gains have been registered, extra efforts must be taken in relation to disarmament. He expressed particular concern over the effects of the heavily polarized international climate, as well as the potential of having an arms race in the immediate neighbourhood. He called for compliance with the Treaty, as well as for a diminished role of nuclear weapons in defence and security doctrines. Voicing support for the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and adoption of a verifiable fissile material cut-off treaty, he also said he hoped to see resumed implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Further, a greater focus on nuclear energy safety is needed in the region, he said, cautioning States against building such plants in areas of high seismicity and stressing the importance of updated early warning systems.\n\nTEBURORO TITO (Kiribati), associating himself with the Pacific small island developing States, expressed concern that nuclear weapon States have yet to fulfil their article VI obligations or commitments under the 2010 Action Plan, and are instead modernizing and expanding their arsenals. He also said he was deeply troubled by the war in Ukraine and threats by the Russian Federation to use nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapon States must urgently diminish the role of these weapons in their military doctrines, remove them from high operational alert and implement all other commitments, he emphasized, recalling that the 2010 outcome document contains a strong reference to the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons use. Many non-nuclear-weapon States ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which fills legal gaps in the Non-Proliferation Treaty and addresses victim assistance, environmental remediation, international cooperation and assistance.\n\nHe recalled that between 1957 and 1962, the United States and United Kingdom conducted 33 thermonuclear tests in Kiribati, leaving 500 citizens with little warning or protection. Explaining that most of them lifted the tarpaulin cover provided for them to catch the spectacular display of an intensely hot fire cloud above, he said \"many of these people complained about all sorts of untreatable illnesses and health complications, most of which resulted in death.\" Cases of cancer, congenital disabilities and abnormalities persist today in their descendants. He thus called on States to support the inclusion of victim assistance and environmental remediation in the Conference outcome document. Discussion is also needed around ensuring international consultation, international law, and independent, verifiable scientific assessment related to the discharge of water treated by the Advanced Liquid Processing System from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. He also voiced concern over the potential impact of the trilateral security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, and underlined his agreement with Indonesia's concerns about nuclear naval propulsion as outlined in Working Paper 67.\n\nBASSAM SABBAGH (Syria), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement, pointed out that the 1995 resolution calling for a zone free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East still has not been implemented. While all countries in the region are ready to take steps to create that zone, Israel is defying the international community, and refusing to accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear-weapon State and submit its nuclear installations to the IAEA safeguards system. Israel is refusing to cooperate because it is supported by the United States and Western allies, he added, noting that for decades the United States and other Western countries have given Israel modern nuclear technology, allowing it to build its nuclear military capacity. He underscored the right of States parties to obtain nuclear technology and use that technology in different fields. He condemned unilateral coercive measures imposed by Western countries on Syria that hinder technical assistance for the peaceful uses of atomic energy, particularly in the fields of health and cancer treatment, noting that they negatively impact citizens' lives.\n\nJARMO VIINANEN, Ambassador for Arms Control, Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, condemned the Russian Federation's unprovoked and unjustified attack against Ukraine, and Belarus for its involvement. With President Vladimir Putin's threats of nuclear use undermining the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament architecture, \"arms control is unravelling,\" he stressed. He also urged the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to comply with its international obligations and called for revival of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, with Iran cooperating fully with the IAEA. \"This grim reality is a wake-up call for us,\" he said, underlining that now is the time for action to strengthen the rules-based international order. He welcomed the extension of the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), adding that further reductions by the two biggest nuclear weapon States in their arsenals are key in building confidence and gradually advancing the ultimate goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. Non-nuclear-weapon States have a legitimate right to receive legally binding, unequivocal assurances that there is no threat of nuclear use against them, he said. Therefore, it is high time to initiate a process leading to an international treaty on negative security assurances. Finland was the first country to sign the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA; it also adopted early the Additional Protocol, he noted, urging all States to conclude the Additional Protocol.\n\nDIEGO PARY RODR\u00cdGUEZ (Bolivia), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement, expressed regret that 77 years after 200,000 people died in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the world is still unable to understand that nuclear weapons are the most inhumane weapons to have ever been conceived. It is concerning that global military spending has reached $2 trillion, especially when people are still suffering from the COVID-19 crisis. With States possessing 13,000 warheads -- of which 2,000 are on alert -- compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty is a moral imperative. The notion that these weapons are an indispensable, legitimate source of guarantees is an indefensible argument. Nuclear weapons must be eliminated from security doctrines and defence policies, he said, adding that article VI obligations should be a priority topic at the Review Conference. All nuclear-weapon States must reduce their arsenals and curb tests that aim to modernize nuclear weapons, yet they only increase catastrophic humanitarian risks. He urged all countries to join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Noting that Bolivia is in the first densely populated region in the world to be declared nuclear-weapon-free, thanks to the Treaty of Tlatelolco, he said his country has banned the manufacture and use of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons on its territory. He called for universal, non-discriminatory, irreversible and binding guarantees to achieve the Treaty's universality, which would enable future generations to avoid events like those that occurred in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nDIJANA IVAN\u010cI\u0106, Assistant Minister for Security Policy of Serbia, detailing national measures to address the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, underscored that the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons remains the foundation of international peace and security. Preventing States from developing nuclear weapons and non-State actors from acquiring them must remain a priority for all. Affirming the essential role of the IAEA in verifying nuclear programmes, she voiced her support for negotiations on the Iranian nuclear programme and diplomatic efforts aimed at the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. On disarmament, she welcomed the decision by the United States and the Russian Federation to extend the validity of the New START Treaty for five years, as well as the five nuclear powers' joint declaration on the prevention of nuclear war and the avoidance of a new arms race. Urging all nuclear-weapon States to find new ways to fulfil their obligations under article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, she added that it is unacceptable to threaten the use of nuclear weapons to resolve disputes between States.\n\nHAMAD ALKAABI (United Arab Emirates), associating himself with the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative countries, Non-Aligned Movement and the Arab Group, said that his country now has three operational nuclear power reactors supplying clean and sustainable energy -- a successful programme that testifies to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and its international cooperation framework. Member States with operational nuclear facilities that have yet to join the IAEA's Convention on Nuclear Safety, such as Iran, should do so. The reported violent actions at nuclear facilities in Ukraine are posing a serious threat to the safety and security of these facilities, their personnel, millions of civilians, and the environment. The international community must make every possible effort to avoid a nuclear disaster, whether from a direct attack on a nuclear facility or as an unintended consequence of conflict. Stressing that advancement in Iran's sensitive nuclear activities has no real civilian purpose and remains a source of concern, he called for that country's full and timely cooperation with the IAEA. Similarly, he urged the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to respect its international obligations and to refrain from actions that could escalate tensions in the region and beyond. The way forward to a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East requires further efforts and assurances from the depository States who have special responsibility as co-sponsors of the 1995 resolution.\n\nYOUSSOUPH DIALLO (Senegal), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group, recalled the Secretary-General's warning that the world is under the risk of nuclear annihilation. He called on States in possession of these arsenals to end their modernization and urged them to submit all nuclear facilities and activities to the full IAEA safeguards regime. In the meantime, negotiations must be launched on an international treaty obliging nuclear States to guarantee universal, unconditional, effective assurances to non-nuclear-weapon States. He reiterated Senegal's support for the Treaty of Pelindaba, which consolidates the status of Africa as a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and for a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. Welcoming the extension of the New START Treaty, he called on the parties to work for further reductions in their strategic armaments in Europe, and for a relaunched Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Emphasizing the inalienable right of every State to research, develop and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, he added that sharing experiences, good practices and equipment would benefit the entire international community -- particularly in the context of the climate emergency. He invited all parties to implement the conclusions of the 1995, 2000 and 2010 Review Conferences, citing the urgency of avoiding deadlock of the Ninth Review Conference.\n\nMARWAN ALI NOMAN AL-DOBHANY (Yemen), associating himself with the Arab Group and the Non-Aligned Movement, said the Middle East lacks stability and a sense of security due to a power imbalance and nuclear activities not subject to the non-proliferation regime. While all Arab countries have joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty and are working to establish a zone free from nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction, Israel continues to defy the international community by refusing to join the Non-Proliferation Treaty and submit its nuclear facilities to the IAEA's safeguards regime. Also, Iran continues to develop its nuclear capacities and not abide by the IAEA's safeguards regime, leading to increased tensions in the region. Voicing concern at some nuclear States' security and military doctrine that allows the use of nuclear weapons and upgrading of nuclear arsenals, he called on the international community to elaborate an international instrument obliging nuclear States to not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States.\n\nTAREQ M. A. M. ALBANAI (Kuwait) called for renewed commitment to the Treaty, urging the Review Conference to adopt an ambitious action plan that \"makes up for missed opportunities\", notably in disarmament. Noting that some States announced they will continue to modernize their nuclear arsenals and keep these weapons in their military doctrines -- challenges which must be addressed through the Treaty, he voiced hope that Kuwait's concerns will be taken into account during negotiations on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. He called for follow-up on Security Council resolution 2231 (2015), urging partners to negotiate an agreement verifying the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme. He condemned any nuclear tests or provocation that undermines international peace and security, urging States that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. A lack of political will, including by Israel, has led to the indefinite postponement of a conference to set up a nuclear- weapons-free zone in the Middle East. Stressing that the 1995 decision on the Middle East \"remains valid until its purposes have been achieved\", he said that as President of the second session of the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction, Kuwait will work with participating countries in an open, transparent manner. He called on countries that sponsored the 1995 resolution, and other regional countries not participating, to join the discussions. He also attached great importance to technical cooperation activities, adding that the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons should not contravene or weaken current mechanisms, but rather help to rid humanity of these arms.\n\nKRISTEL L\u00d5UK (Estonia), associating herself with the European Union, said the Russian Federation's actions, which directly threaten the safety and security of Ukraine's nuclear facilities, and particularly the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, must stop immediately. The Non-Proliferation Treaty \u0301s viability must be reinforced, she said, noting that her country continues to advocate for the \"progressive approach\" pursued in a realistic and responsible way. Given the high tensions in international security, Member States must make a collective effort to uphold and strengthen the existing disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation architecture. She welcomed the extension of the New START Treaty and urged China to engage in those processes as well. She also called on Iran to collaborate with the IAEA to resolve all questions on its safeguards obligations. In addition, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea must engage in a process of complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of all its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, she said, pointing out that sanctions must remain in place and fully implemented until then.\n\nRIYAD MANSOUR, Permanent Observer for the State of Palestine, associating himself with the Arab Group and Non-Aligned Movement, stressed that this conference should \"reinforce the dividing line between our capacity to build and our capacity to destroy, between life and extinction\". The use or threatened use of nuclear weapons has always been illegal -- as their very essence violates the fundamental principles of humanity and distinction -- and there is no rational justification for the privileged status granted de facto to nuclear weapons over other weapons of mass destruction. He underscored, therefore, that there is also no justification for \"Israeli exceptionalism in our region\", whereby that State would be the only one entitled to hold nuclear weapons. \"Our region should be free of nuclear weapons, full stop,\" he stressed, calling for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. The only alternative to the pursuit of effective nuclear disarmament in the region is a dangerous arms race and potential nuclear proliferation. He added that the only effective remedy against the threat nuclear weapons pose to all of humanity is \"ridding the world of these weapons\".\n\nHAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group, pointed to the situations in the Middle East, the Korean Peninsula and Ukraine, and called on the international community to recommit to compliance with applicable international law. Nuclear-weapon States must fulfil their multilateral legal obligations on nuclear disarmament. He urged all States that have yet to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, particularly the remaining Annex II States, to do so without further delay. He also called on non-State parties to join the Non-Proliferation Treaty as non-nuclear-weapon States, for the treaty to achieve full universality. On the peaceful development of nuclear technology, he noted that since 2018, Ghana has been focused on its atomic science objectives aimed at producing a significant baseload of electricity for the country's industrialization and its rapid socioeconomic transformation of the country, while being mindful of safety and environmental concerns.\n\nJOS\u00c9 EDUARDO PEREIRA SOSA (Paraguay) expressed concern over the revival of a security model based on deterrence and the threatened use of nuclear weapons, which is a latent risk that jeopardizes collective security. Nuclear-weapon States must commit to complete disarmament, as humanity cannot again suffer the consequences of a nuclear bomb. Emphasizing that the Non-Proliferation Treaty is a keystone of the disarmament regime, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy, he called on all States that are not party to the Treaty to accede to the instrument without further delay or conditions. He went on to say that the Treaty can be complemented by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the declaration of nuclear-weapon-free zones, such as those established by the Treaties of Tlatelolco and Rarotonga, and called for stronger synergy between these instruments to strengthen cooperation and build trust. He added that the rights of all States to develop and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes must be respected pursuant to article IV of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, welcoming the fundamental role played by the IAEA and its safeguard system in this regard.\n\nLESLIE NORTON (Canada), speaking in her national capacity, said the international community will achieve a world free of nuclear weapons \"by doing it -- together\". The stakes could not be higher, with the Russian Federation's illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Its irresponsible threats regarding the possible use of nuclear weapons and seizure of nuclear facilities have shaken the foundations of the international world order. She also pointed to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's unprecedented missile testing and nuclear activities and Iran's continued violations of its nuclear commitments and obligations. Nuclear-weapon States bear a special responsibility to come forward this month with proposals for credible and incremental steps towards nuclear disarmament. Highlighting the work of cross-regional groupings, she cited the Stockholm Initiative's \"stepping stones\" and risk reduction package; the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative's \"Landing-Zone\" paper; and the Vienna Group of 10 paper on \"Addressing Vienna issues\". The commencement of long-overdue negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty would be one concrete step forward. Further, the Conference must address the proliferation crises in Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, reaffirming the essential role of the IAEA. Peaceful uses of nuclear energy can help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, helping overcome global challenges such as climate change and zoonotic threats. She noted that Canada is a leader in nuclear research and development in nuclear medicine and pharmacology, environmental protection and wastewater treatment, as well as next-generation power reactors and nuclear energy systems.\n\nIKRAM MOHAMMAD IBRAHIM (Malaysia), associating himself with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Non-Aligned Movement, voiced concern about the growing risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. He underscored the importance and validity of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East and pointed out that the resolution is an integral part of the package of decisions reached that enabled the indefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1995. Malaysia joins the call for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East region without delay, he said. Turning to Southeast Asia, he said all issues pertaining to the signing and ratification of the Protocol to the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty must be resolved urgently. Nuclear-weapon States must ratify the related protocols to all treaties establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones, and respect the denuclearized status of those zones, he added. Regarding the Korean Peninsula, he urged the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to refrain from further provocative and illegal acts, and to abide by its obligations under relevant Security Council resolutions.\n\nENKHBOLD VORSHILOV (Mongolia), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement, underscored his country's commitment to the Treaty, while also highlighting the \"outstanding\" work of the IAEA, pursuant to articles III and IV, in verifying compliance with non-proliferation undertakings and supporting parties in fulfilling their inalienable right to research, produce and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Noting that Mongolia ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and acceded to the instrument on 10 December 2021, he welcomed the convening of the first meeting of States parties in June. He also noted that 2022 marks the thirtieth anniversary of Mongolia's nuclear-weapon-free status; it declared its territory a single-State nuclear-weapon-free zone in 1992. In 2014, Mongolia initiated the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security, a mechanism for facilitating talks and promoting mutual understanding and confidence-building. Its seventh conference, held this June, brought together 150 representatives from 20 countries and 30 international organizations. With that in mind, he urged States parties to renew their political will and flexibility to forge a constructive outcome to the Review Conference.\n\nALYA AHMED SAIF AL-THANI (Qatar) said nuclear weapons are the greatest threat to humanity and civilization, with increased dangers, as the non-proliferation regime faces major challenges. Successive international crises are impacting the peaceful use of nuclear energy, especially in developing countries. The international community must respect its contractual obligations, aiming for full realization of article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty -- which is indispensable for reaching a legally-binding instrument for guarantees from nuclear-weapon States to non-nuclear-weapon States to neither use nor threaten to use such weapons against them. The IAEA is key to verification of non-proliferation, and reaching the goals of the Treaty; however, the result of its work will be insufficient if there is a lack of enough effort towards reducing nuclear testing. Emphasizing the right of all States to the peaceful use of nuclear energy as an important part of development, she appreciated IAEA efforts to render the world more safe and secure -- particularly through its technical cooperation programme. Calling on advanced countries to provide scientific and technical assistance to developing countries, she affirmed the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East as a collective responsibility covered by a number of resolutions.\n\nSRDAN ORLANDIC (Montenegro), associating himself with the European Union, said the current compromised security environment is best demonstrated by the Russian Federation's military aggression against Ukraine. He called on States that have not yet done so to join the Non-Proliferation Treaty and urged those who are already its Parties to adhere fully to its provisions. Pending the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and adoption of a fissile material cut-off treaty, he also urged all States to abide by the moratorium on nuclear weapon tests and declare an immediate moratorium on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. Simultaneously, the international community must place a special emphasis on the potential of peaceful use of nuclear energy, with nuclear energy being an essential component for low-carbon transition. He had previously welcomed the agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation to extend the New START Treaty and the restatement of the Reykjavik Summit declaration between the two parties. However, the Russian Federation's onslaught on Ukraine represents a blatant violation of international humanitarian law, international human rights law and the rules-based international order, casting an enormous shadow over everything positive and constructive achieved beforehand. He once again called on Moscow to immediately and unconditionally stop all fighting and withdraw all of its forces and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine.\n\nMr. PAVLOV (Belarus) said that almost 30 years ago his country made a conscious decision to renounce nuclear weapons without preconditions or reservations and joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear State. Any insinuations regarding a change in his country's non-nuclear status, as well as its noncompliance with obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, are unfounded. Highlighting the international community's collective responsibility to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons, he outlined specific steps and stressed that the international community must reduce nuclear risk and make nuclear disarmament a multilateral and irreversible process. It must ensure the swift entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty; give new impetus to the process of creating nuclear-weapon-free zones; and consider developing a universal legally binding agreement whereby nuclear-weapon States grant non-nuclear weapons State unequivocal and unconditional assurances against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.\n\nESAM O. BEN ZITUN (Libya), underlining how the existence of nuclear weapons is a latent destructive threat for humanity, said the Review Conference will allow for assessing progress in achieving a world free of nuclear weapons. In that regard, he urged that past outcome documents be carefully taken into account. Eliminating nuclear weapons is the only guarantee that they will not be used, he stressed, calling for activating disarmament processes, including the Disarmament Conference, which unfortunately is at a stalemate due to a lack of political will. Urgent measures must be taken so that the Conference can undertake its mandated role, a call made by the Non-Aligned Movement and like-minded countries for some time. Countries must foster the Non-Proliferation Treaty's universality by calling on nuclear weapons States to uphold their article VI obligations and progressively reduce their nuclear stockpiles. He also called for balanced, non-discriminatory implementation of the Treaty's three pillars. Expressing support for the establishment of nuclear weapons-free zones, he recalled Assembly resolution 63/546, which urged the Secretary-General to hold a conference for negotiating a treaty that would create such a zone in the Middle East. He urged all parties to participate in this conference.\n\nBRIAN WALLACE (Jamaica) stressed that \"nuclear weapons should not exist in the future we want to bequeath to our children.\" He continued that \"to put it bluntly, a nuclear weapon detonation whether by accident, design or miscalculation, can eliminate countries like Jamaica from the face of the planet\". Nuclear weapons are the biggest threats to mankind today because they remain under the control of fallible human beings. Not only is it morally indefensible and legally irresponsible to house and spread these weapons, he stressed, but the vast and increasing expenditure in the face of underfunded sustainable development priorities is grossly reprehensible. He further called for advancement on establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in all areas of the world. Stressing that the transboundary movement of radioactive materials through the Caribbean Sea poses a serious threat to the region, he called for a total ban on that practice -- as well as agreements with the IAEA to ensure a decreased likelihood of accidents, and for establishing response and emergency rules in the event of a nuclear spill or other incidents. He further called for entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, as well as a ban on fissile materials consistent with article VI of the Treaty -- as well as greater cooperation to ensure that nuclear technology is shared, especially with non-nuclear-weapon States, to enhance their development.\n\nVICTORIA LIETA LIOLOCHA (Democratic Republic of the Congo) emphasized that the full, non-discriminatory and balanced implementation of the three pillars of the Non-Proliferation Treaty is crucial for maintaining that instrument's credibility, achieving its objectives and maintaining international peace and security. Underscoring that the best way to avoid the humanitarian consequences of nuclear-weapon detonation -- even if accidental in nature -- is to totally eliminate such weapons, she detailed several national efforts, including speaking out on the need to fill the legal vacuum relating to nuclear weapons and ratifying the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Treaty of Pelindaba. The Democratic Republic of the Congo also signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons -- which complements the Non-Proliferation Treaty -- and she urged countries that have not yet done so to sign and ratify that 2017 instrument. She added that the implementation of disarmament commitments will allow more resources to be allocated to sustainable development and to preventative efforts to address health emergencies.\n\nCARLOS AMORIN (Uruguay), associating himself with Canada on behalf of a group of States on gender, said his country -- faithful to its pacifist vocation -- reaffirmed its unshakeable commitment to strengthening the disarmament regime. The international community must redouble its efforts, without losing sight of the ultimate objective of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons in an irreversible, verifiable and transparent manner. In the meantime, there must be a legally binding guarantee from nuclear-weapon States foregoing the use or threat of use of those weapons -- which continues to hang over the world, and is a crime against humanity. Expressing concern over the stalemate on article VI obligations, he noted that some countries are even updating their arsenals and increasing spending. The five permanent Security Council members should reaffirm their statement of January that a nuclear war must never be fought because it cannot be won. With the developing world less developed under the COVID-19 pandemic, he called for funds to be allocated to development rather than towards a new arms race. He cited the Treaty of Tlatelolco -- the first nuclear-weapon-free zone in a densely populated territory -- which inspired other zones in the South Pacific, South-East Asia, Africa and Central Asia, with a zone covering the Middle East hopefully in the offing as well.\n\nMAJID TAKHT RAVANCHI (Iran), noting that certain nuclear-weapon States appear to have in practice put aside their nuclear disarmament obligations, said the United States has recently increased the role and number of its nuclear weapons and that modernization costs around $1.2 trillion. The United Kingdom has announced its intention to develop and build 80 new nuclear warheads. As well, France is spending billions of euros to gradually augment and upgrade its nuclear weapons and their launch platforms. The Review Conference's top priority and objective should be to change the status quo and eliminate the risks of nuclear weapons. Non-nuclear-weapon States are adhering to their non-proliferation undertakings, except for a few European parties, including Germany which hosts many nuclear weapons in its territory. Iran, as a steadfast supporter of nuclear disarmament, is equally committed to nuclear non-proliferation, and supports the non-discriminatory and impartial implementation of the IAEA safeguards system, he said.\n\nHe went on to state that due to the application of double standards in enforcing non-proliferation provisions, \"the Zionist regime's\" nuclear weapons, developed with the United States' support, continue to pose a serious threat to the security of Middle East States Parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. That terrorist regime has assassinated several innocent nuclear scientists and has threatened to attack his country's safeguarded peaceful nuclear facilities, he added, urging the Review Conference to promptly address the threat posed by the Israeli regime. On nuclear negotiations, he said that while his country was implementing its nuclear commitments under the nuclear deal, the United States withdrew from it in May 2018 and subsequently reimposed sanctions on his country. Since April 2021, Iran has negotiated in good faith to resume the deal's full implementation. It will cease its remedial actions and resume the full implementation of its nuclear-related measures in accordance with the 2015 agreement when the United States decides to give assurance that Iran will enjoy the promised economic benefits in the accord, he said.\n\nABIODUN RICHARDS ADEJOLA (Nigeria), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement, the African Group, the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative and the Group of 156 countries on the Humanitarian Consequences of nuclear weapons, said non-nuclear weapons States must be assured against the threat or impact of the deployment of nuclear weapons under a legally binding framework. He welcomed nuclear-weapon States' gestures to reduce their stockpile of those weapons, while pointing out that his country's highest expectation is for those States to wholly eliminate their nuclear arsenals. Nuclear-weapon-free zones are practical steps towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons, he pointed out. The African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, also known as the Treaty of Pelindaba, demonstrates the continent's will in that regard, he said, voicing full support for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones across all regions, including in the Middle East.\n\nOMAR KADIRI (Morocco), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement, African Group and the Arab Group, said his country has always been actively engaged in regional and international disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. In accordance with its commitment to combat against all forms of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, it has adopted a Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, and has also endorsed the Declaration of Principles of the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. In accordance with its commitments to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, his country has ratified the Pelindaba Treaty establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa. The establishment of such a zone in the Middle East is fundamental to peace and security in that region and is most urgently needed. Morocco has set up a regulatory authority for the safety and security of nuclear and radioactive materials and has a renowned nuclear science and technology research centre. In partnership with the IAEA, it is working to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\n\nLUIS ANTONIO LAM PADILLA (Guatemala) reiterated the importance of the mutually reinforcing pillars of the Treaty, expressing concern that countries are upgrading their arsenals and developing new kinds of weapons, even amid the complex global security scenario and ongoing effects of COVID-19. \"Nuclear weapons are a crime against humanity and a violation of international law,\" he said, including international humanitarian law and the Charter of the United Nations. The only guarantee against their use is their elimination in a verifiable, transparent manner within a specified timeframe. He welcomed the holding of the first meeting of States parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Guatemala is a promoter of nuclear-weapon-free zones, he said, welcoming the conference on the establishment of such a zone in the Middle East and calling on States in the region to negotiate a treaty for that zone. He denounced the Russian Federation's illegal and unjustified aggression against Ukraine, acknowledging the volatile situation in Ukraine around the Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia plants, creating disturbances in the exclusion zone and posing a severe threat to nuclear security. He called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and returning control of these plants to Ukraine. He expressed regret over the lack of progress in disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. \"We should not settle for simple repetitions of commitments made at previous meetings,\" he said. \"As States parties to the Treaty, we are in the right place to exercise the responsibility we have to protect peace and security for the benefit of future generations.\"\n\nRYTIS PAULAUSKAS (Lithuania), aligning himself with the European Union, said that the Russian Federation's aggressive, irresponsible nuclear rhetoric directly contradicts its role as a permanent member of the Security Council and its aggression poses a serious threat to the safety and security of Ukrainian nuclear facilities. He urged the Russian Federation to cease its dangerous nuclear rhetoric and behaviour immediately, including by withdrawing its military and other personnel from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Further, the Russian Federation has violated the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, under which nuclear-weapon States committed to respect Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and existing borders. The Memorandum also gave security assurances to Belarus after it declared its territory nuclear-free in 1990. Also of concern is Belarus' irresponsible statements expressing its readiness to host Russian nuclear weapons on its territory, which would run contrary to Belarus' obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear State. In addition, he called on China to demonstrate responsibility and join nuclear-arms-control talks; Iran to return to full implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action; and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to comply with its obligations under relevant instruments.\n\nRight of Reply\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation, speaking in exercise of the right of reply, addressed statements by certain delegations \"feigning concern over nuclear facilities in Ukraine\" about the presence of Russian Federation military forces at the Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants. Those activities in no way undermine nuclear security in Ukraine, as the military is guarding the power plants to prevent Ukrainian nationalist groups and foreign mercenaries from carrying out nuclear provocations which would have catastrophic consequences. He cited an incident on 24 March when Ukrainian saboteurs fired from a building adjacent to the Zaporizhzhia plant. Rebuffed by military forces, the saboteurs then set the building on fire; Western media, at Ukraine's instigation, claimed the fire was the result of Russian Federation shelling. On 9 March, Ukraine blew up the power lines for the cooling system on the Chernobyl territory, with Russian Federation forces then connecting it to backup diesel generators. On 27 April, he noted, an unmanned aerial vehicle attack on the Zaporizhzhia plant used Polish made aerial systems -- which could qualify as Warsaw abetting nuclear terrorism. Citing further attacks on 18 July and 20 July, he stressed that Ukraine is trying to set the stage for a nuclear catastrophe. The Russian Federation regularly informs the IAEA of such incidents and has photographic and video evidence to confirm them. He further noted that it is not the Russian Federation that is preventing access by Agency inspectors.\n\nThe representative of the Ukraine reminded his Russian Federation colleague that it is not Ukrainian forces on Russian Federation territory, but vice versa. His country does not require protection of its nuclear facilities from those forces, as it has its own capabilities for that purpose. He recalled Resolution ES-11/1 adopted during the eleventh emergency session of the General Assembly, which deplored in the strongest terms the aggression of the Russian Federation in violation of Article II of Charter of the United Nations, demanding that State withdraw all its forces from Ukrainian territory. The overwhelming majority of the General Assembly voted in favour. He called on the Russian Federation's delegate not to deny the undeniable or justify the unjustifiable, and end its temporary occupation.", "source": {"uri": "press.un.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "press.un.org"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 60, "stanza_neu": 234, "stanza_pos": 28, "swn_neg": 322, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7137319577", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "18:29:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T18:29:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T18:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5921568870544434, "url": "https://www.thejakartapost.com/paper/2022/08/02/un-chief-warns-of-nuclear-annihilation.html", "title": "UN chief warns of 'nuclear annihilation'", "body": "Am\u00e9lie Bottollier-Depois (Agence France-Presse) (The Jakarta Post)\n\nUnited Nations head Antonio Guterres warned on Monday that a misunderstanding could spark nuclear destruction as the United States, United Kingdom and France urged Russia to stop \"its dangerous nuclear rhetoric and behavior.\"\n\nAt the opening of a key nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) conference in New York, Guterres warned that the world faced \"a nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War.\"\n\nCiting Russia's war with Ukraine and tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the Middle East, Guterres said he feared that crises \"with nuclear undertones\" could escalate.", "source": {"uri": "thejakartapost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jakarta Post"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.7019607843137254, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 2, "stanza_neu": 2, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 4, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7140970146", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-05", "time": "13:19:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-05T13:19:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-05T12:13:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5882353186607361, "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/why-nuclear-weapons-hard-rid-121318370.html", "title": "Why are nuclear weapons so hard to get rid of? Because they're tied up in nuclear countries' sense of right and wrong", "body": "Every five years, the nearly 200 member states of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons meet to review their progress - or lack thereof. After being postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the monthlong conference is now meeting in New York and opened with a stark warning.\n\nThe world is \"just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,\" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Aug. 1, 2022, citing growing conflicts and weakening \"guardrails\" against escalation.\n\nThe treaty has three core missions: preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to states that do not have them, ensuring civil nuclear energy programs do not turn into weapons programs, and facilitating nuclear disarmament. The last review conference, held in 2015, was widely regarded as a nonproliferation success but a disarmament failure, with the five members that possess nuclear weapons failing to make progress toward eliminating their nuclear arsenals, as promised in previous conferences.\n\nAt the heart of this dispute are states' motivations for keeping nuclear weapons - often perceived as rooted in hard-nosed security strategy, by which morality is irrelevant or even self-defeating.\n\nAs a nuclear ethicist, though, I see these explanations as incomplete. To understand leaders' motives - and therefore effectively negotiate the elimination of nuclear weapons - other scholars and I argue we must acknowledge that policymakers express underlying moral concerns as strategic concerns. History shows that such moral concerns often form the foundations of nuclear strategy, even if they're deeply buried.\n\nIt is easier for many people to see how the nuclear abolitionist argument is fundamentally based in morality. The fear of nuclear winter - or even a less severe \"nuclear autumn\" - is rooted in the immorality of killing millions of innocent people and devastating the environment in long-lasting ways.\n\nBy contrast, a realistic and strategic approach to the value of nuclear weapons has dominated security discourse since the early Cold War era. This approach argues that the primary purpose of nuclear weapons is to deter adversaries from attacking vital national security interests. If an attack does occur, then nuclear weapons can be used to punish aggression in a proportional way and caution other adversaries, restoring nuclear deterrence.\n\nEven so, according to political scientist Joseph Nye, the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs under President Bill Clinton, a strategist may pose as a moral skeptic but \"tends to smuggle his preferred values into foreign policy, often in the form of narrow nationalism.\"\n\nNationalism asserts the moral priority of one's own nation over others. Communities' deep-held beliefs are intimately woven into ideas about nationhood, security and prestige.\n\nIn the United States, for example, the moral underpinnings of American identity are deeply rooted in the idea of being \"a city on a hill\": an example the rest of the world is watching. Americans are anxious about losing their way, and many feel that their country was once a force for good in the world, but no longer. Thus, national survival is embraced as a moral value, and deterring or defending against aggression has strategic, political and moral overtones.\n\nRegardless of whether someone thinks these concerns are justified, it is important to recognize that, in their defenders' view, they go beyond strategy or sheer survival. They reflect societies' foundational ideas about what is wrong and right - their sense of morality.\n\nSo how are these moral concerns applied to the questions of nuclear weapons and their role in security strategy?\n\nIt is worth remembering what motivated President Franklin D. Roosevelt to authorize the development of the atomic bomb: the genocidal evil of Nazi German aggression in World War II and the knowledge that Adolf Hitler had begun an atomic bomb program.\n\nAnd when Nazi Germany had been defeated, the U.S. justifications for using atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki centered on two kinds of moral concerns. The most frequently invoked was utilitarian: preventing a greater number of deaths in a land invasion of Japan. The second, not expressed as explicitly, viewed the atomic bombing as a kind of moral punishment for the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor and the brutal treatment of Allied prisoners of war.\n\nIn short, the motivations for the original atomic bomb program and its uses could not be described in solely \"hard-nosed\" strategic terms. As political philosopher Michael Walzer has argued, both morality and strategy are about justification: Both tell us what we should do or should not do, based on some set of values. And strategy is often used for decision-makers' moral aims, such as their goal to defeat a genocidal regime.\n\nAlong with other scholars, I have argued that moral concerns also motivated the central role of nuclear deterrence policy during the Cold War. American policymakers portrayed Soviet communism, like Nazism, as a politics of brute force that had no regard for law or morals. Once the Soviet Union and China had acquired nuclear weapons, American analysts came to believe that communism represented an existential threat not only to U.S. security, but to liberal democracy in general.\n\nWalzer described such situations as \"supreme emergency conditions,\" in which ordinary moral prohibitions against mass destruction are suspended to ensure what political leaders see as the highest value: national survival.\n\nThis is self-preservation - but people often think about that, too, as a moral concern. Social norms against suicide, for example, imply that people have a moral duty to preserve their lives except under certain conditions, reflecting a belief that human life has intrinsic moral value.\n\nWalzer did not claim that using nuclear weapons, or even threatening their use, was morally justified. However, he suggested they might be necessary for national security, and therefore become morally excusable in supreme emergency situations. His argument has been very influential in government and academic circles.\n\nMany critics claim that it is always immoral to use nuclear weapons, since they cannot discriminate between soldiers and innocent civilians, including children, the elderly and the infirm. Moreover, the use of nuclear weapons cannot but bring social and environmental catastrophe, the kind that our darkest dystopian novels and films depict. And if it is immoral to use nuclear weapons, it is immoral to threaten to use them.\n\nBut it is unsurprising that the leaders of the nuclear-weapon states are ultimately committed to the survival of their countries and peoples, even if others must pay an ultimate price. To fully appreciate nuclear motivations, we must understand the role of this kind of moral concern in their decision-making.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

But building nuclear plants takes time, and the process in the UAE started approximately 13 years ago.\n\nVietnam has been considering nuclear power for decades now, according to the World Nuclear Association, an international trade group. The country announced a plan to build a nuclear power plant back in 2006, but put those plans on hold in 2016, partly because of the expense. Then, in March, Vietnam published an official draft energy proposal that includes small modular nuclear reactors.\n\nThe United States and the IAEA have both helped guide Vietnam in its efforts to include nuclear energy in its national energy plan, Ha Kim Ngoc, deputy foreign minister, said at Tuesday's event. The reactors are an appealing option for the relatively small country, Ngoc said.\n\nSouth Africa has two reactors, according to the World Nuclear Association, and now other countries in Africa are interested in deploying nuclear energy.\n\n\"Most of the countries where I come from in Africa have very small grids,\" said CEO Collins Juma of Kenya's Nuclear Power and Energy Agency. Advanced nuclear reactor designs, especially small modular reactors, are intriguing, but Juma did hint that paying for such reactors might be hard. \"I'm not sure about the cost, but we shall be discussing that in other forums.\"\n\nAs Africa works to decarbonize, nuclear is a critical baseload corollary to wind, solar and geothermal in the continent. But bringing nuclear energy to Africa will require independent and strong regulation to convince people it is safe.\n\n\"Nuclear is a very emotive topic,\" Juma said.

Guterres says the meeting is taking place \"at a time of nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War.\"", "source": {"uri": "keyt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsChannel 3-12"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@keyt.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "image": "https://keyt.b-cdn.net/2022/06/US-World-AP-860x484.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.6235294117647059, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 1, "stanza_neu": 3, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 4, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7139172006", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-04", "time": "06:36:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-04T06:36:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-04T06:26:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "url": "https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2022/08/04/2753089/north-korea-says-will-never-tolerate-us-criticism-of-its-nuclear-program", "title": "North Korea Says Will 'Never Tolerate' US Criticism of Its Nuclear Program - Other Media news - Tasnim News Agency", "body": "North Korea has conducted missile tests at an unprecedented pace this year and international experts believe it is readying its seventh nuclear test, the first since 2017.\n\nThe North's permanent mission to the United Nations issued the statement on Wednesday as diplomats gathered in New York for a month-long UN conference to review the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), Reuters reported.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during the meeting the North \"continues to expand its unlawful nuclear program\" and \"is preparing to conduct its seventh nuclear test.\"\n\n\"It is the peak of busy blaming that the United States alleges somebody's 'nuclear threats' given the fact that it is the kingpin of nuclear proliferation,\" North Korea said in the statement.\n\nThe North also said it pulled out of the non-proliferation treaty a long time ago, so nobody had the right to impinge on the country's right to self-defense.\n\n\"We will never tolerate any attempt by the US and its servile forces to groundlessly accuse our State and encroach upon our sovereign rights and national interests,\" the North said in its statement.\n\nLast week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country was ready to mobilize its nuclear war deterrent and counter any US military clash.", "source": {"uri": "tasnimnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062e\u0628\u0631\u06af\u0632\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u062a\u0633\u0646\u06cc\u0645"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://newsmedia.tasnimnews.com/Tasnim/Uploaded/Image/1396/05/17/1396051715243471511597794.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 3, "stanza_neu": 5, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 8, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7137320469", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "18:30:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T18:30:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T18:29:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "url": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/politics/phil-twyford-heads-to-new-york-with-a-goal-of-getting-us-and-russia-to-put-down-their-bombs/X73D6GSDSQQB5JJSHXFWHHVK4E/", "title": "Twyford vs. The Bomb: Minister on mission to contain nuclear arsenals", "body": "Disarmament Minister Phil Twyford is in New York City this week, leading a bipartisan delegation to the United Nations.\n\nTwyford's ultimate goal is an almost impossible one - for now that is: the abolition of nuclear weapons. This is probably why he has set himself something a little more achievable: ensuring the \"nuclear non-proliferation treaty remain[s] an important part of the architecture of peace\".\n\nTwyford, and his parliamentary colleagues, National's Todd McClay and Labour's Jenny Salesa are visiting New York for a five-yearly review conference on the UN's Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT. The conference will check in on the treaty and, as Twyford says, try to ensure it remains relevant.\n\nTwyford himself admits it's easy to see the flaws in the treaty. In January, five of its signatories who possess nuclear weapons issued a press release affirming that a \"nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought\". Months later, one of those signatories, Russia, was making nuclear threats over the war in Ukraine. Not only do nuclear weapons seem to be proliferating - so do threats of nuclear war.\n\nThe treaty allowed the five countries that had tested nuclear weapons before 1967 - the US, Russia, China and France - to keep them, and to encourage those countries to slowly disarm. It's had some success in this area: nuclear weapons stockpiles are well down on their Cold War peak.\n\nBut there are failures too. India, Pakistan, North Korea, and probably Israel, have developed nuclear weapons despite the NPT, Russia is teasing the prospect of nuclear war and nuclear states like the UK, that had previously been relied on to bang the disarmament drum are now talking about increasing their arsenals.\n\nThe Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists' annual Doomsday Clock, an academic marketing exercise that reckons how close humans are to man-made apocalypse, is set at 100 seconds to midnight - closer than at any point in our history.\n\nTwyford is realistic about progress.\n\n\"It's been a tough time for nuclear arsenals in recent years. Progress has stalled if not reversed,\" he said in an interview with the Herald before leaving for New York.\n\nTwyford is there to take part in the review of the NPT because \"the world needs it\".\n\n\"Since 1968, it has played a very important role in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. Not entirely successfully, but largely,\" Twyford said.\n\n\"And until the TPNW - the ban treaty - the NPT has been the main bit of international law the world has looked to for the disarmament and elimination of nuclear arsenals,\" he said.\n\nTwyford is the Disarmament and Arms Control Minister, a portfolio established when New Zealand went nuclear free in 1987. The role was by junked by National in 2011, but revived by Labour in 2018 and given to Winston Peters. Twyford has been in the chair since 2020.\n\nThe TPNW, or The Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is the other major international treaty Twyford looks after. Signed in 2017, it calls for the outright prohibition and swift abolition of nuclear weapons. No country that possesses or hosts nuclear weapons can be a signatory, and those that do, must commit to a swift disarmament.\n\nIt won't achieve disarmament overnight, but its 86 signatories and 66 parties hope it will keep up the pressure on nuclear-armed states to disarm. New Zealand is an active member of this agreement too, and Twyford travelled to Vienna this year to deliver a speech for the first meeting of parties to the agreement.\n\nTwyford reckons progress towards disarmament was looking up a decade ago, when US President Barack Obama and Russia's Dmitry Medvedev showed some will to push towards disarmament.\n\n\"Obama's Prague Speech [2009] gave people hope that for the first time since Reagan and Gorbachev we were going to see some political will on behalf of the US and Russia,\" Twyford said.\n\nBut Obama gave way to Donald Trump, and Medvedev turned out to be simply keeping the seat warm for current President Vladimir Putin who was on a brief, constitutionally mandated sabbatical during Medvedev's single presidential term. Now, disarmament ambitions are in tatters.\n\n\"The nuclear weapons states are investing large amounts of money - 100 millions if not billions of dollars in the modernisation of their arsenals.\n\n\"All the old agreements and treaties have fallen by the wayside. We've seen China investing massively in expanding its arsenal. The British, who were among the most transparent of nuclear powers, are reducing the cap they had committed to as part of their arsenal [increasing the number of warheads they hold],\" Twyford said.\n\n\"We are at more danger now in terms of catastrophe than at any point since the Cuban Missile Crisis,\" he said.\n\nWhile nuclear weapons states are rearming, disarmament appears to be becoming a more significant part of New Zealand's foreign policy. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern used much of her three minutes at the Nato summit in Madrid this year calling on states to disarm - a slightly awkward intervention given the nuclear deterrent is a central plank of Nato's collective defence policy.\n\nIn that speech, she made a direct plea to Nato states to use the NPT's meeting to recommit to disarmament.\n\n\"I also come with a request: that we do not allow the legacy of the war in Ukraine to become an arms race, or an even more polarised and dangerous world,\" she told the conference.\n\nOur solidarity with Ukraine must be matched by an equal commitment to strengthen international institutions, multilateral forums and disarmament.\n\n\"As the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty convenes for its tenth review conference in August, I hope all members agree to send a strong message. Because if not now, when the threat is even greater, then when?\" she said.\n\nDisarmament was also mentioned as a \"priority\" in Ardern's major foreign policy speech at the Lowy institute in Sydney last month.\n\nDespite the pessimistic backdrop, there's some optimism. Twyford noted US President Joe Biden came into office with a new commitment to New Start, a US-Russia nuclear weapons reduction treaty, which was extended last year, and the Strategic Stability Dialogue, a commitment to predictable relations between the two countries that is meant to reduce the risk of nuclear war.\n\nDespite these efforts, however, the war in Ukraine seems only to have brought the threat of nuclear war closer, thanks to Russia's threats, and this has only served to whet the appetites in the West for further nuclear armament.\n\nThis makes New York tricky. Twyford said New Zealand will continue to condemn all nuclear threats, but New Zealand also needs Russia at the table to further the disarmament agenda.\n\nHe said New Zealand wants \"nuclear weapons states coming to New York serious about nuclear disarmament\".\n\nTwyford said there were like-minded allies in Thailand, Indonesia, Egypt, South Africa, and Nigeria.\n\nBut any breakthrough would probably be reliant on the two biggest nuclear powers agreeing to something between them, in much the same way the US and China's prior agreement on climate change paved the way for the signing of the Paris agreement in 2015.\n\n\"We should be looking to the US and Russia to make some kind of commitment to get around the table and undertake nuclear disarmament between the two of them and i think that would create the climate,\" Twyford said.\n\nSo far, there's been some hope on both sides.\n\nBefore the meeting, Putin repeated what had been said in January: \"There can be no winners in a nuclear war and it should never be unleashed, and we stand for equal and indivisible security for all members of the world community,\" he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, New Zealand time, Twyford attended a meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nIn a published speech, Blinken said that while the NPT had made the world safer, it was \"increasingly under strain\".\n\nBlinken added Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent the \"worst possible message\" to countries trying to disarm, which was that nuclear armed states were more easily able to pick on countries without nuclear weapons - and in Ukraine's case, a country that had given up those weapons.\n\nBiden also said he was \"ready to expeditiously negotiate a new arms control framework\" to replace New Start, the agreement between the US and Russia, when it expires in 2026.\n\n\"Russia should demonstrate that it is ready to resume work on nuclear arms control with the United States,\" he said.\n\nTwyford said the statement from Biden got the conference \"off to an encouraging start\".\n\n\"That's exactly the sort of leadership the NPT needs right now and we hope other nuclear weapons states will follow suit,\" Twyford said.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "view_profile@nzherald.co.nz", "name": "View Profile", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/LGDOM2PHWuA_u8JhRx9F4ueXyP4=/1200x675/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/GCMF7PPINP6ZJZSYATSTBINROQ.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 50, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 64, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7139080665", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-04", "time": "04:49:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-04T04:49:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-04T04:29:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "url": "https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/n-korea-says-never-tolerate-042950935.html", "title": "N.Korea says will 'never tolerate' U.S. accusation of its nuclear programme", "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea warned it will \"never tolerate\" the United States' criticism of the isolated country's nuclear programme, calling Washington the \"kingpin of nuclear proliferation\" and saying it would not allow any encroachment of its sovereign rights.\n\nNorth Korea has conducted missile tests at an unprecedented pace this year and international experts believe it is readying its seventh nuclear test, the first since 2017.\n\nThe North's permanent mission to the United Nations issued the statement on Wednesday as diplomats gathered in New York for a month-long U.N. conference to review the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during the meeting the North \"continues to expand its unlawful nuclear programme\" and \"is preparing to conduct its seventh nuclear test.\"\n\n\"It is the peak of busy blaming that the United States alleges somebody's 'nuclear threats' given the fact that it is the kingpin of nuclear proliferation,\" North Korea said in the statement.\n\nThe North also said it pulled out of the non-proliferation treaty a long time ago, so nobody had the right to impinge on the country's right to self-defence.\n\n\"We will never tolerate any attempt by the U.S. and its servile forces to groundlessly accuse our State and encroach upon our sovereign rights and national interests,\" the North said in its statement.\n\nLast week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country was ready to mobilise its nuclear war deterrent and counter any U.S. military clash.\n\n(Reporting by Soo-hyang Choi;

Great power rivalry is putting pressure on the multilateral disarmament architecture. New weapons systems are being developed and deployed. Proliferation challenges are on the rise. New threats to international peace and security continue to emerge.\n\nThe NPT has helped to safeguard global security for more than half a century. It is the cornerstone of our efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons. It is essential that we seize this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the Treaty and build on its achievements along all three pillars.\n\nRussia's unprovoked and ruthless military attack on Ukraine has altered the security landscape in Europe and beyond. Russia's reckless rhetoric on nuclear weapons has global implications. Russia signed the joint P5 statement in January affirming that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. We cannot allow the threshold for nuclear use to be lowered.\n\nThe DPRK's pattern of ballistic missile tests and continuous development of its nuclear programme are of great concern. We urge the DPRK to return to dialogue, and to take concrete steps to abandon its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programmes in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner.\n\nThe situation surrounding the JCPOA is deeply worrying. We urge the Islamic Republic of Iran to return to full compliance and to resume full cooperation with the IAEA.\n\nPresident,\n\nThe current challenges to nuclear disarmament are numerous. Yet, we must persist in our efforts to prepare the ground for future binding arms control and disarmament agreements. Disarmament must be mutual, balanced, verifiable, and irreversible. All nuclear-weapon States should step up their efforts to fulfil their commitments under Article VI.\n\nThe work on nuclear disarmament verification has progressed in this review cycle. We encourage the Conference to support these continued efforts.\n\nThe Quad Nuclear Verification Partnership, in which Norway participates, has presented a working paper on its activities and results relating to technical verification.\n\nWe ask States parties to join us in reaffirming the principle of irreversibility as a basic principle in disarmament alongside transparency and verification. Together with the United Kingdom, Norway has submitted a working paper on this topic with the aim of starting a multilateral dialogue.\n\nNorway is part of the Stockholm Initiative, which has presented 22 concrete recommendations for advancing nuclear disarmament, with a separate package of measures on nuclear risk reduction. We encourage all States to support our recommendations.\n\nIn addition, we present a working paper on the Norwegian experience in engaging scientific and technical expertise supporting our efforts to advance the NPT.\n\nPresident,\n\nTransparent implementation of commitments made at previous review conferences is crucial. Norway has presented a report on its national implementation of the conclusions and recommendations of the 2010 Review Conference.\n\nAny use of nuclear weapons would have catastrophic humanitarian consequences. This was stated in 2010. Norway will work with States parties to build on this acknowledgment. It must continue to motivate us in seeking a path towards real disarmament.\n\nNorway strongly advocates the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and the early negotiation and conclusion of a verifiable Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT).\n\nWe continue to support the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East.\n\nPresident,\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is the key international institution for ensuring compliance with non-proliferation obligations. We call on all states to sign a Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and an Additional Protocol, which today constitute the global verification standard.\n\nRussia's violent seizure of control of nuclear facilities in Ukraine is deplorable. We fully support the IAEA's efforts, including the Director General's seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety and security.\n\nPeaceful nuclear applications can support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Norway has therefore provided USD 1 million to the IAEA's Peaceful Uses Initiative.\n\nWe firmly believe that all countries should be able to benefit from advanced technologies that have the potential for enhancing health and prosperity. International cooperation on non-proliferation, including on export control, is crucial for preventing proliferation of nuclear and nuclear-related material, equipment and technologies.\n\nWe encourage States with highly enriched uranium (HEU) to minimise and eliminate their stocks and use of HEU.\n\nBuilding competence and capacity, and promoting broad-based participation, including by women and young people, are crucial to the future of the NPT.\n\nIn the weeks ahead, we must work together, along all three pillars, to revitalise and strengthen the Treaty and our commitments.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 5, "stanza_neu": 37, "stanza_pos": 9, "swn_neg": 51, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7140995273", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-05", "time": "13:43:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-05T13:43:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-05T13:02:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5686274766921997, "url": "https://siouxcityjournal.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/why-are-nuclear-weapons-so-hard-to-get-rid-of-because-theyre-tied-up-in/article_3f197333-2b25-53b3-9524-8d2eb240d4be.html", "title": "Why are nuclear weapons so hard to get rid of?

The last review conference, held in 2015, was widely regarded as a nonproliferation success but a disarmament failure, with the five members that possess nuclear weapons failing to make progress toward eliminating their nuclear arsenals, as promised in previous conferences.\n\nAt the heart of this dispute are states' motivations for keeping nuclear weapons - often perceived as rooted in hard-nosed security strategy, by which morality is irrelevant or even self-defeating.\n\nAs a nuclear ethicist, though, I see these explanations as incomplete. To understand leaders' motives - and therefore effectively negotiate the elimination of nuclear weapons - other scholars and I argue we must acknowledge that policymakers express underlying moral concerns as strategic concerns. History shows that such moral concerns often form the foundations of nuclear strategy, even if they're deeply buried.\n\nNational values\n\nIt is easier for many people to see how the nuclear abolitionist argument is fundamentally based in morality. The fear of nuclear winter - or even a less severe \"nuclear autumn\" - is rooted in the immorality of killing millions of innocent people and devastating the environment in long-lasting ways.\n\nBy contrast, a realistic and strategic approach to the value of nuclear weapons has dominated security discourse since the early Cold War era. This approach argues that the primary purpose of nuclear weapons is to deter adversaries from attacking vital national security interests. If an attack does occur, then nuclear weapons can be used to punish aggression in a proportional way and caution other adversaries, restoring nuclear deterrence.\n\nEven so, according to political scientist Joseph Nye, the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs under President Bill Clinton, a strategist may pose as a moral skeptic but \"tends to smuggle his preferred values into foreign policy, often in the form of narrow nationalism.\"\n\nNationalism asserts the moral priority of one's own nation over others. Communities' deep-held beliefs are intimately woven into ideas about nationhood, security and prestige.\n\nIn the United States, for example, the moral underpinnings of American identity are deeply rooted in the idea of being \"a city on a hill\": an example the rest of the world is watching. Americans are anxious about losing their way, and many feel that their country was once a force for good in the world, but no longer. Thus, national survival is embraced as a moral value, and deterring or defending against aggression has strategic, political and moral overtones.\n\nRegardless of whether someone thinks these concerns are justified, it is important to recognize that, in their defenders' view, they go beyond strategy or sheer survival. They reflect societies' foundational ideas about what is wrong and right - their sense of morality.\n\nEarly motives\n\nSo how are these moral concerns applied to the questions of nuclear weapons and their role in security strategy?\n\nIt is worth remembering what motivated President Franklin D. Roosevelt to authorize the development of the atomic bomb: the genocidal evil of Nazi German aggression in World War II and the knowledge that Adolf Hitler had begun an atomic bomb program.\n\nAnd when Nazi Germany had been defeated, the U.S. justifications for using atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki centered on two kinds of moral concerns. The most frequently invoked was utilitarian: preventing a greater number of deaths in a land invasion of Japan. The second, not expressed as explicitly, viewed the atomic bombing as a kind of moral punishment for the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor and the brutal treatment of Allied prisoners of war.\n\nIn short, the motivations for the original atomic bomb program and its uses could not be described in solely \"hard-nosed\" strategic terms. As political philosopher Michael Walzerhas argued, both morality and strategy are about justification: Both tell us what we should do or should not do, based on some set of values. And strategy is often used for decision-makers' moral aims, such as their goal to defeat a genocidal regime.\n\nMorally excusable?\n\nAlong with other scholars, I have argued that moral concerns also motivated the central role of nuclear deterrence policy during the Cold War. American policymakers portrayed Soviet communism, like Nazism, as a politics of brute force that had no regard for law or morals. Once the Soviet Union and China had acquired nuclear weapons, American analysts came to believe that communism represented an existential threat not only to U.S. security, but to liberal democracy in general.\n\nWalzer described such situations as \"supreme emergency conditions,\" in which ordinary moral prohibitions against mass destruction are suspended to ensure what political leaders see as the highest value: national survival.\n\nThis is self-preservation - but people often think about that, too, as a moral concern. Social norms against suicide, for example, imply that people have a moral duty to preserve their lives except under certain conditions, reflecting a belief that human life has intrinsic moral value.\n\nWalzer did not claim that using nuclear weapons, or even threatening their use, was morally justified. However, he suggested they might be necessary for national security, and therefore become morally excusable in supreme emergency situations.

Because they're tied up in nuclear countries' sense of right and wrong", "body": "Texas State University provides funding as a member of The Conversation US.\n\nEvery five years, the nearly 200 member states of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons meet to review their progress - or lack thereof. After being postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the monthlong conference is now meeting in New York and opened with a stark warning.\n\nThe world is \"just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,\" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Aug. 1, 2022, citing growing conflicts and weakening \"guardrails\" against escalation.\n\nThe treaty has three core missions: preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to states that do not have them, ensuring civil nuclear energy programs do not turn into weapons programs, and facilitating nuclear disarmament. The last review conference, held in 2015, was widely regarded as a nonproliferation success but a disarmament failure, with the five members that possess nuclear weapons failing to make progress toward eliminating their nuclear arsenals, as promised in previous conferences.\n\nAt the heart of this dispute are states' motivations for keeping nuclear weapons - often perceived as rooted in hard-nosed security strategy, by which morality is irrelevant or even self-defeating.\n\nAs a nuclear ethicist, though, I see these explanations as incomplete. To understand leaders' motives - and therefore effectively negotiate the elimination of nuclear weapons - other scholars and I argue we must acknowledge that policymakers express underlying moral concerns as strategic concerns. History shows that such moral concerns often form the foundations of nuclear strategy, even if they're deeply buried.\n\nNational values\n\nIt is easier for many people to see how the nuclear abolitionist argument is fundamentally based in morality. The fear of nuclear winter - or even a less severe \"nuclear autumn\" - is rooted in the immorality of killing millions of innocent people and devastating the environment in long-lasting ways.\n\nBy contrast, a realistic and strategic approach to the value of nuclear weapons has dominated security discourse since the early Cold War era. This approach argues that the primary purpose of nuclear weapons is to deter adversaries from attacking vital national security interests. If an attack does occur, then nuclear weapons can be used to punish aggression in a proportional way and caution other adversaries, restoring nuclear deterrence.\n\nEven so, according to political scientist Joseph Nye, the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs under President Bill Clinton, a strategist may pose as a moral skeptic but \"tends to smuggle his preferred values into foreign policy, often in the form of narrow nationalism.\"\n\nNationalism asserts the moral priority of one's own nation over others. Communities' deep-held beliefs are intimately woven into ideas about nationhood, security and prestige.\n\nIn the United States, for example, the moral underpinnings of American identity are deeply rooted in the idea of being \"a city on a hill\": an example the rest of the world is watching. Americans are anxious about losing their way, and many feel that their country was once a force for good in the world, but no longer. Thus, national survival is embraced as a moral value, and deterring or defending against aggression has strategic, political and moral overtones.\n\nRegardless of whether someone thinks these concerns are justified, it is important to recognize that, in their defenders' view, they go beyond strategy or sheer survival. They reflect societies' foundational ideas about what is wrong and right - their sense of morality.\n\nEarly motives\n\nSo how are these moral concerns applied to the questions of nuclear weapons and their role in security strategy?\n\nIt is worth remembering what motivated President Franklin D. Roosevelt to authorize the development of the atomic bomb: the genocidal evil of Nazi German aggression in World War II and the knowledge that Adolf Hitler had begun an atomic bomb program.\n\nAnd when Nazi Germany had been defeated, the U.S. justifications for using atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki centered on two kinds of moral concerns. The most frequently invoked was utilitarian: preventing a greater number of deaths in a land invasion of Japan. The second, not expressed as explicitly, viewed the atomic bombing as a kind of moral punishment for the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor and the brutal treatment of Allied prisoners of war.\n\nIn short, the motivations for the original atomic bomb program and its uses could not be described in solely \"hard-nosed\" strategic terms. As political philosopher Michael Walzer has argued, both morality and strategy are about justification: Both tell us what we should do or should not do, based on some set of values. And strategy is often used for decision-makers' moral aims, such as their goal to defeat a genocidal regime.\n\nMorally excusable?\n\nAlong with other scholars, I have argued that moral concerns also motivated the central role of nuclear deterrence policy during the Cold War. American policymakers portrayed Soviet communism, like Nazism, as a politics of brute force that had no regard for law or morals. Once the Soviet Union and China had acquired nuclear weapons, American analysts came to believe that communism represented an existential threat not only to U.S. security, but to liberal democracy in general.\n\nWalzer described such situations as \"supreme emergency conditions,\" in which ordinary moral prohibitions against mass destruction are suspended to ensure what political leaders see as the highest value: national survival.\n\nThis is self-preservation - but people often think about that, too, as a moral concern. Social norms against suicide, for example, imply that people have a moral duty to preserve their lives except under certain conditions, reflecting a belief that human life has intrinsic moral value.\n\nWalzer did not claim that using nuclear weapons, or even threatening their use, was morally justified. However, he suggested they might be necessary for national security, and therefore become morally excusable in supreme emergency situations. His argument has been very influential in government and academic circles.\n\nMany critics claim that it is always immoral to use nuclear weapons, since they cannot discriminate between soldiers and innocent civilians, including children, the elderly and the infirm. Moreover, the use of nuclear weapons cannot but bring social and environmental catastrophe, the kind that our darkest dystopian novels and films depict. And if it is immoral to use nuclear weapons, it is immoral to threaten to use them.\n\nBut it is unsurprising that the leaders of the nuclear-weapon states are ultimately committed to the survival of their countries and peoples, even if others must pay an ultimate price.

The prime minister's ability to communicate this message will likely be tested in the future.\n\n\"It's important for Japan to show how we are taking realistic steps toward the ideal of a nuclear-free world,\" Kishida said to reporters, explaining the aims of the Hiroshima Action Plan he presented, which included calls for increased transparency of nuclear forces, among other things.\n\nAn aide to the prime minister said Kishida is skeptical of the treaty, which is promoted by the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) and others.

Clashing geopolitical dynamics and disrupted supply chains have created a full-blown energy crisis. Ongoing fuel shortages and pressing climate concerns require a balanced solution that is sustainable, reliable, and innovative. Fortunately, there is a proven energy source that checks each one of those requirements. The new challenges precipitated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, combined with the imperative of addressing climate change, underscore with new urgency what we have long known to be true. The United States can promote global energy security and strengthen its national security by accelerating the deployment of innovative nuclear energy technologies.\n\nThe interconnected nature of global energy systems and supply chains creates a security dilemma, but the United States can minimize that risk by licensing and deploying nuclear technologies made domestically and in allied countries. The United States has a long history of leadership in developing nuclear technologies, and there has been significant progress made in recent years to realize the potential of the next generation of nuclear power right here at home. The benefits are tangible and significant: nuclear energy ensures both domestic and international access to a carbon-free, reliable, and secure baseload energy source, which is critical to maintaining service, avoiding societal disruption, and decreasing our reliance on foreign fossil fuel sources. By leveraging new technologies and innovation through appropriate federal trade support, the United States can ensure that its nuclear reactor designs are a critical part of the world's energy mix to achieve climate goals and prioritize global energy stability.\n\nAs the conflict in Ukraine intensifies, Central and Eastern Europe provide the clearest examples of how U.S. nuclear energy exports can help strengthen global energy security. While 20 percent of the nuclear reactor fleet in the region is of U.S. origin, the continued dependence on Russian natural gas and oil supplies points to the clear need for additional American-made nuclear technologies to address this vulnerability. In Ukraine, which historically has been dependent on Russia for at least half of its fuel, the nuclear energy firm Westinghouse recently signed an agreement to increase the number of planned AP1000 reactors from five to nine, as well as supply all of the nuclear fuel needed for Ukraine's current fleet. In Poland, Westinghouse and Bechtel, a U.S. engineering firm, signed a partnership agreement to provide three Westinghouse reactors to a plant on Poland's Baltic coast. Additionally, in May the United States announced a partnership with Romania to supply a training simulator in advance of a NuScale Power small modular reactor (SMR). The country could become the first in Europe to build this new type of nuclear power plant. The development of small modular reactors, as well as larger reactors in Central and Eastern Europe, is a positive sign for the future of the region's energy security and decarbonization efforts.\n\nThe United States and its allies have developed the most technologically advanced and innovative nuclear reactor designs and fuel. However, even the best U.S. nuclear technology firms will be hard pressed to compete with Russian and Chinese state-owned nuclear enterprises, which enjoy a full range of economic support from their respective governments. As a result, Russian and Chinese designs comprise more than half of all nuclear plants under construction worldwide. In the United States, nuclear technology exporters face an uphill battle with a complicated nuclear regulatory regime overseen by multiple agencies ranging from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to the Department of Energy (DOE). Additionally, U.S. reactor projects do not get the same government subsidies that Russian and Chinese projects do, making U.S.-led developments more expensive.\n\nCeding the upper hand on designing and exporting advanced nuclear technologies to those regimes poses a clear and present risk to U.S. national and energy security in the long term. It is a battle that we cannot lose. Adding to the sense of urgency, a significant number of reactors are approaching the end of their timelines both domestically and abroad. Advanced U.S. nuclear technologies stand ready to fill that gap, but they need more political and regulatory support for civil nuclear exports. Efforts such as the DOE's Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program and updates to the 2022 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies spending bill help support these objectives, but policymakers can and should do more to achieve a whole-of-government, comprehensive perspective of security and innovation which recognizes the significant value proposition of carbon-free nuclear energy.\n\nIt is also crucial that the federal government support U.S.-based enrichment facilities to provide the domestic capabilities needed to wean ourselves off of Russian-supplied enrichment. The need for a reliable domestic nuclear fuel supply provides another avenue for bold new collaboration between the private and public sectors. Establishing a sufficient domestic fuel supply will ensure that the world's most reliable source of carbon-free energy is even more secure. By possessing control of the process from start to finish and building these capabilities, the United States will create jobs at conversion and enrichment sites across the country.\n\nLooking forward, elevating U.S. nuclear innovation and global leadership by supporting the development and exportation of nuclear technology is central to driving national security, bolstering global energy security, and mitigating the climate crisis. Furthermore, U.S. leadership in civil nuclear exports ensures that the highest standards of safety, security, and non-proliferation will be upheld. The increasing momentum in support of nuclear energy in the United States and abroad shows the possibilities of partnerships that utilize traditional and advanced nuclear reactors for safety and sustainability. There is no looking back. Now is the time for the United States, together with its allies, to lead the way toward energy independence and stability around the globe.\n\nAmbassador Richard Morningstar, Founding Chairman of the Atlantic Council's Global Energy Center, Former U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Azerbaijan and to the European Union", "source": {"uri": "nationalinterest.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National Interest"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/2021-11-01T161102Z_1008497872_RC2QLQ9T50UZ_RTRMADP_3_CLIMATE-UN.JPG.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 3, "stanza_neu": 21, "stanza_pos": 14, "swn_neg": 38, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 2, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7138298126", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-03", "time": "13:11:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-03T13:11:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-03T12:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5607843399047852, "url": "https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3542800-russia-behaves-like-a-monkey-with-a-nuclear-grenade-ukraine-at-un.html", "title": "Russia behaves like \"a monkey with a nuclear grenade\" - Ukraine at UN", "body": "Russia is a threat to international security as it is attacking Ukraine's nuclear infrastructure.\n\nThat's according to Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Mykola Tochytskyi, who spoke at the UN event entitled \"Nuclear Safety and Security Situation in Ukraine: Threats to International Security in connection with the seizure of Ukraine's nuclear facilities by Russian Federation,\" an Ukrinform correspondent reports.\n\n\"From the beginning of Russia's war against Ukraine, the Russian armed forces have been indiscriminately targeting Ukraine's infrastructure, including critical facilities thus creating unprecedented nuclear threats to Ukraine and far beyond,\" Tochytskyi said.\n\nMoscow behaves like \"a monkey with a nuclear grenade,\" while the international community is witnessing how nuclear terrorism, sponsored by a nuclear power, the Russian Federation, is arising, the senior diplomat said.\n\nThe Ukrainian diplomat noted that the Russian invasion in February 2022 exposed the inability of the international organizations to provide an adequate response to the new challenges and nuclear risks related to war.

Representatives from all of the signatory nations are attending and the conference will run until August 26. During the conference's opening remarks, the representative from Russia said something that raised questions among many of the attendees. He claimed to be delivering a message from Vladimir Putin, flatly declaring that nuclear war should not be a consideration for any nation. A nuclear war, he said, \"cannot be won and must never be fought.\" The United States sent Antony Blinken to address the conference and he was rightly skeptical of Putin's renewed embrace of non-proliferation. (Associated Press)\n\nA Russian official on Tuesday twice repeated President Vladimir Putin's new message that \"a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought,\" apparently trying to roll back on Putin's warning after the Ukraine invasion that Russia is a \"potent\" nuclear power and any attempt to interfere would lead to \"consequences you have never seen.\"\n\nPutin's comment then dramatically escalated global tensions, which rose even further days later when he ordered Russian nuclear forces put on high alert.\n\nIgor Vishnevetsky, deputy director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's nonproliferation and arms control program, started his country's address to the pandemic-delayed conference to review the 50-year-old Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty by reading Putin's message to participants against a nuclear war. And he repeated the same words later.\n\nSo I'm guessing Igor Vishnevetsky didn't make it onto the no-fly list when everyone was imposing sanctions and boycotts on Russia? Granted, he's not exactly a senior person in the Kremlin, working as the director of Russia's nonproliferation and arms control program. Non-proliferation hasn't been a hot topic lately and Vishnevetsky didn't seem to have any trouble flying into New York City so he could attend. Also, he's not one of the people the Kremlin sends out to deliver fiery rhetoric and bombast, either, so he's probably more palatable to the international crowd.\n\nStill, it's rather odd to have anyone from Russia delivering that particular message. Putin is the one who has been reminding the world about his vast stockpile of WMDs and threatening \"consequences you have never seen.\" But this isn't the first time the Kremlin has sent out that non-proliferation message. It showed up on a Russian website back in January before the invasion began.\n\nBlinken expanded on a theme others were invoking in their remarks. Everyone was sounding as if nuclear brinksmanship is back on the table, but nobody wants to take the blame for it.\n\nBlinken, America's top diplomat, said Monday that the U.S. chose \"to act with restraint\" in response to Russia's actions and avoid anything that could unintentionally raise nuclear tensions. As examples, he said the U.S. abandoned previously scheduled tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles and did not raise the alert status of its nuclear forces \"in response to Russia's saber-rattling.\"\n\n\"There is no place in our world -- no place in our world -- for nuclear deterrence based on coercion, intimidation or blackmail,\" Blinken said. \"We have to stand together in rejecting this.\"\n\nIt's a pity that we can't take Putin's message very seriously because it's actually a solid principle. If we wind up entering into a full-scale nuclear exchange, there really won't be a \"winner\" in that war. It would just be a question of who ran out of weapons first and who could still muster some troops amid the smoking ruins. And now that both the Russians and the Chinese are playing with hypersonic missile technology, the stakes are even higher.\n\nI'd like to think that Russia has just been bluffing about a nuclear first strike. Unfortunately, I'm no longer entirely sure of that. China is probably far less likely to launch a nuclear first strike, but if push comes to shove they will wind up siding with Russia. But there's no telling what Mad Vlad might do these days. If it looks like Russia is eventually in danger of losing the war in Ukraine entirely, we can't rule out the possibility that he'll light off a nuke. And then the world will hold its breath for a moment and wait to see how everyone else responds. You might want to practice hiding under your desk like we did back in the 60s.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jazz_shaw@hotair.com", "name": "Jazz Shaw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/o/2017/279/c22ab166-897d-4e5d-9c9a-16d92e0d536e-1200x630.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 9, "stanza_neu": 26, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 37, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7137393035", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "19:57:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T19:57:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T19:32:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5568627715110779, "url": "https://en.trend.az/world/other/3628404.html", "title": "China does't intend to be first to use nuclear weapon", "body": "BAKU, Azerbaijan, August 2.

KAZINFORM - Kazakhstan delegation led by First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Akan Rakhmetullin took part in the Tenth Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which takes place from August 1 to 26 in New York, USA. The event is attended by representatives of 133 states and specialized NGOs. The previous 9th NPT Review Conference was held in 2015, Kazinform has learned from the press service of the Kazakh Foreign Ministry.\n\nIn his speech at the opening of the Conference, the head of the delegation called the NPT the cornerstone of the modern architecture of international security, noting the real contribution of our country to the processes of nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes - the three pillars of the Treaty. Rakhmetullin called for strict compliance by States with all these cornerstone principles of the NPT.\n\nThe Kazakh delegation stated that the country would continue working to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime during its chairmanship of the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security issues) of the upcoming 77th session of the UN General Assembly. In addition, our country, as the Chairman of the Third Conference of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), will make every effort to achieve the universal goal of the total elimination of nuclear weapons.\n\nDuring the plenary session, Rakhmetullin also delivered a statement on behalf of the participating states of the Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia (CANWFZ), noting the key role of nuclear-weapon-free zones in the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and called on the conference participants to support efforts to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones in other regions of the world.\n\nOn the sidelines of the conference, the head of the Kazakh delegation held meetings with the USA Under Secretary of State Bonnie Jenkins, Assistant Minister for Trade of Australia, Senator Tim Ayres, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration of Moldova Ruslan Bolbocean, heads of delegations of the member states of the CANWFZ, during which he discussed topical issues in the field of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, expansion of cooperation on the peaceful use of atomic energy.\n\nHe also took part in the high-level meeting of the Stockholm Initiative on Nuclear Disarmament, during which the participating States exchanged views on establishing a dialogue between nuclear weapon and non-nuclear weapon states, reducing the role of nuclear weapons in security doctrines and policies, as well as complete nuclear disarmament.", "source": {"uri": "inform.kz", "dataType": "news", "title": "kazinform"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.inform.kz/radmin/news/2022/08/04/220804102014839e.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 0, "stanza_neu": 11, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 11, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7140704301", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-05", "time": "09:32:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-05T09:32:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-05T08:51:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5490196347236633, "url": "https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/dprk/2022/dprk-220804-kcna01.htm", "title": "Press Statement of DPRK Permanent Mission to UN", "body": "Pyongyang, August 4 (KCNA) -- The Permanent Mission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the United Nations on Aug. 3 released the following press statement regarding the anti-DPRK confrontational clamor by the United States and some servile States Parties with unwarranted accusations against the DPRK at the 10th Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT):\n\nA long time ago, the DPRK pulled out of the NPT through the legitimate procedure under the relevant article stipulated in the NPT.

The nonsense that Chris Bowen is carrying on with about nuclear being expensive compared to wind and solar - it's a nonsense argument.\n\nHow do nuclear power plants work?\n\n1. Producing electricity from nuclear energy requires splitting atoms to release the energy.\n\n2. Nuclear reactors fuelled by uranium pellets produce atom-splitting nuclear fission.\n\n3. As they split, atoms release particles which cause other atoms to split, causing a chain reaction.\n\n4. The chain reaction creates heat that warms a cooling agent such as water or liquid metal.\n\n5. Steam is produced that powers turbines which feed energy to generators that produce electricity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'We have to stick to the facts instead of the emotion on this issue, and we're going to lose industry, there are going to be smelters, and others are closed down under this government, the jobs will go offshore, and the emissions will still go into the air.\n\n'If we want a situation where we are going to have blackouts and brownouts and rationing like we are seeing in Germany, then keep going down the path the government is taking us.'\n\nHis comments come after energy prices soared due to rising demand for coal and gas prompted by the early onset of winter and Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\n'Sixty per cent of the capacity of our coal-fired generators is expected to leave the market by 2030,' he said in a statement.\n\n'This will leave Australian households and businesses vulnerable to a re-run of the chaos we are now seeing under Labor.\n\n'If we are serious about reducing emissions, while at the same time maintaining a strong economy and protecting our traditional industries, all technologies need to be on the table.\n\nMr Dutton said that an 'honest discussion' about nuclear power was urgently needed but that the government was unwilling to listen.\n\n'The Coalition will show Australians that we are prepared to undertake this honest and informed debate, which has alluded our country for too long.'\n\n'The fact we can't have a discussion about nuclear in our country in the 21st century when France is investing more into nuclear, when the United Kingdom is, when Germany is, when Italy is, China, Asia - it's nonsense.'\n\nHe added that nuclear energy would provide zero emissions and is a 'cheap technology' that would steer clear the country clear of the energy crisis.\n\nMr Dutton said the government has avoided even entertaining the idea of using nuclear energy, which he claimed would provide zero emissions and is a 'cheap technology' (pictured, a power station in La Trobe valley)\n\nAnthony Albanese slammed the Coalition for being 'obsessed' by nuclear reactors while ignoring the biggest nuclear reactor of all - the sun.\n\nMr Dutton said the prime minister was 'ideologically opposed' to nuclear energy.\n\n'Bob Hawke was strongly in favour of it, I've spoken to John Howard who is strongly in favour of it.\n\n'If you look around the world, Justin Trudeau - one of the great left wing heroes for this Prime Minister - they can't meet their emissions targets without nuclear,' he added.\n\nWhile the Coalition now discusses backing nuclear, Labor remains opposed, insisting that solar, wind and hydro-electric power are cheaper and faster forms of low emissions energy.\n\nMr Albanese slammed the Coalition for being 'obsessed' by nuclear reactors while ignoring the biggest nuclear reactor of all - the sun.\n\nNuclear power has a PR problem following incidents at reactors such as Three-Mile Island (1979), Chernobyl (1986) and Fukushima (2011).\n\nBut in 31 countries around the world, more than 450 nuclear power plants are connected to the grid.\n\nFrance counts on nuclear power for 75 percent of its electricity, and earns three billion Euros a year as a net exporter to other European nations because of its low cost of generation.\n\nThe French made the decision to embrace nuclear technology way back in the 1970s, after the OPEC oil crisis.\n\nThe US, Russia, China, the UK and Canada all include nuclear power in their energy mix, some of their reactors powered by uranium from Australia.\n\nAustralia is home to a third of the world's uranium, producing about 10 per cent of the world's exports worth over $730million a year.\n\nOptions more suitable for Australia's smaller population may lie in new-generation Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), or by following the example of the larger one-gigawatt plant with four reactors built by Korean company KEPCO at Barakah in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nSMRs generating up to 300 megawatts of power are cheaper and quicker to build, helping nuclear compete with more economical renewables such as solar and wind.\n\nThey can also be built underground and cooled with air rather than water, enhancing safety in their operation.\n\nSMRs also 'load follow', meaning the reactor adjusts output based on demand.\n\nBut the technology remains under development, with its use of new materials, innovative safety features and advanced construction techniques yet to be approved by most international regulators.\n\nPeter Dutton's full statement on nuclear energy\n\nToday, I initiated a formal internal process to examine the potential for advanced and next-generation nuclear technologies to contribute to Australia's energy security and reduce power prices.\n\nThis review will be led by Mr Ted O'Brien MP, Shadow Minister for Climate Change and Energy, who will report to the Coalition policy committee, chaired by Senator the Hon Marise Payne, and the Coalition party room.\n\nIt is high time that Australia had an honest and informed debate on the benefits and costs of nuclear energy.\n\nThe current energy crisis has shown the importance of getting more dispatchable power into the grid. The average wholesale electricity price in the second quarter this year was three times higher than the same time a year ago - a situation described by the Australian Energy Market Operator as 'unprecedented'.\n\nWhile renewables will play an important growing role in Australia's energy mix, they need to be balanced by sufficient investment in dispatchable generation. That is why the Coalition, when in office, supported projects like the Hunter Power Project.\n\nSixty percent of the capacity of our coal-fired generators is expected to leave the market by 2030. This will leave Australian households and businesses vulnerable to a re-run of the chaos we are now seeing under Labor.\n\nIf we are serious about reducing emissions, while at the same time maintaining a strong economy and protecting our traditional industries, all technologies need to be on the table.\n\nNuclear energy is a mature, proven technology. It can provide the reliable, emissions-free, base-load electricity Australia needs. Estimates show that it would cost the world USD $1.6 trillion more to meet the Paris targets without nuclear energy.\n\nAustralia is already a nuclear nation. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation has operated a nuclear research reactor at Lucas Heights for over 60 years. A national conversation about potential of nuclear energy is the logical next step.\n\nMany of Australia's international partners, including France, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Sweden and the United States of America, have adopted nuclear energy technologies.\n\nThe UK Government, for example, has outlined plans to triple the size of its nuclear generation by 2050, providing 25 percent of its projected energy demand.\n\nThe Coalition will show Australians that we are prepared to undertake this honest and informed debate, which has alluded our country for too long.\n\nAdvertisement", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jesse_hyland@dailymail.co.uk", "name": "Jesse Hyland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/08/04/07/61055683-0-image-a-25_1659594357305.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 49, "stanza_pos": 5, "swn_neg": 66, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7138071109", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-03", "time": "10:06:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-03T10:06:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-03T10:05:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5372549295425415, "url": "https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2022/08/03/national/northKorea/korea-north-korea-npt/20220803183925783.html", "title": "Members of NPDI confront North at the UN", "body": "Members of the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative (NPDI), a coalition of a dozen countries including the Netherlands, Germany, Japan and the U.A.E., called for a complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of North Korea's nuclear weapons at the UN nonproliferation conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"The NPDI strongly condemns North Korea's unprecedented series of ballistic missile launches, in violation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions,\" said Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs Political Director Thijs van der Plas in an address to the 10th NPT review conference at the UN headquarters in New York.\n\nHe was speaking on behalf of the NPDI members, a coalition that exists within the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) framework.\n\n\"The NPDI strongly urges North Korea to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner and return to full compliance with its IAEA safeguards agreements and the NPT,\" he said.\n\nNorth Korea was a member of the NPT from 1985 to 2003.

The study argues that the right of peaceful uses of nuclear technology should not be hampered by concerns about nuclear security. Pakistan has instituted a comprehensive and stringent but home-grown mechanism to ensure safety and security of its nuclear weapons, facilities and personnel. In parallel, it closely follows international standards and fulfills global commitments. Pakistan is implementing its National Security Action Plan (NSAP) and has institutionalized a robust command and control system.\n\nPakistan had established the National Command Authority (NCA) in 1999 and later its secretariat known as the Strategic Plans Division (SPD). The NCA has improved its functions and competencies for employment and deployment of the forces over time in a transparent and effective manner in order to build a robust communication and coordination mechanism. Pakistan believes that transparency measures, rational behaviour, international engagements and a strong democratic policy process are in its best interest. The SPD has a dedicated branch working on arms control and disarmament issues that interacts with national and global institutions and bodies to articulate Pakistan's perspective and also benefit from international best practices.\n\nThe SPD has initiated a Personnel Reliability Programme (PRP) by knitting together a cluster of agencies to monitor experts handling sensitive materials and information to avoid any risks of critical information leakage. A multi-layered system of security has been introduced for physical protection of nuclear weapons, infrastructure and installations. The Pakistan Centre of Excellence for Nuclear Security (PCENS), based on national and international best practices and standards, was established in 2012. The PCENS imparts training in the entire range of activities, directly or indirectly linked with nuclear safety and nuclear security. The Director General of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, during his recent visit to this Centre remarked, -- It is very impressive that [Pakistan organizes] the training in a very systemic and operational manner.\n\nIn addition to this, Pakistan adhered to the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) in October 2000, to ensure safe domestic transportation of nuclear weapons and materials and is currently considering acceding to the 2005 amendment to CPPNM after its inter-agency process is completed. In addition, Pakistan passed the widely acknowledged Export Control Act in 2004 to strengthen and regulate controls over the exports, re-export, trans-shipment and transit of goods and technologies related to nuclear and biological weapons and missiles capable of delivering such weapons. The Act led to the creation of a Strategic Export Control Division (SECDIV) in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to formulate and enforce rules and regulations for the implementation of export controls in accordance with the above mentioned act. Pakistan has introduced a national action plan (NAP) on export controls and the safety and security of nuclear facilities and material.\n\nThe PNRA, an independent body, is committed to safeguarding and regulating nuclear facilities and safety to eliminate any possibility of insider/outsider threat to the nuclear and radiation facilities in the country. The PNRA, in tandem with the SPD, also ensures the security of the facilities against external threats. Thus, there is a synergy between nuclear safety and nuclear security in Pakistani system.\n\nPakistan is a member in the IAEA, the IAEA Code of Conduct, the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540, the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, the Container\n\nSecurity Initiative, and IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB).\n\nPakistan realizes that transparency measures, rational behaviour and a strong democratic process are in its best interest. This change is very significant and Pakistan is engaging with the international community to learn from their best practices and experiences through its proactive participation in the Nuclear Security Summit (NSS). Pakistan has outlined five pillars of its nuclear security regime at the NSS at The Hague: comprehensive command and control structure under the NCA; intelligence and surveillance systems; an autonomous regulatory system; a rigorous/stringent domestic export control regime; and proactive cooperative arrangements with the international community.\n\nPakistan's nuclear security arrangements have been widely acclaimed at the global level. The above arrangements and efforts by Pakistan discount the possibility of any theft of nuclear materials. The US Department of Defence has recently expressed its confidence in the security of nuclear weapons and related materials in Pakistan. In a message to Pakistani leading newspaper it said, -- Pakistan has a professional and dedicated security force that understands the importance of nuclear\n\nsecurity.\n\nThe then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had stated, [Pakistan's] nuclear assets are in safe hands and that Pakistan's command and control system is invincible. Pakistan's then Chief of Army Staff, Gen. Raheel Sharif, during a recent visit to the Centre of Excellence, said -- Pakistan has taken measures, including setting up of the PCENS, to strengthen its nuclear security. He also reiterated, -- Nuclear security is a sacred responsibility\u2016 and lauded the progress the institution has made after its establishment. Like other nuclear weapons states, Pakistan also recognizes the need to safeguard its strategic assets and related materials in its larger national interest. This is why Pakistan is managing its effective custodial control against theft, sabotage, mishaps, and accidents.\n\nMainstreaming Pakistan in the Global Nuclear Order:\n\nNow the question arises: what is normalization and mainstreaming? We believe that Pakistan is already a normal and responsible nuclear weapons state. Mainstreaming means: giving Pakistan its due recognition as a nuclear weapons state. Entry into the NSG alone, however, would not mainstream Pakistan, without an explicit or implicit recognition of Pakistan as a nuclear weapons state by the NPT member states. Pakistan has been actively pursuing norms and principles that are consistent with the non-proliferation regime and this should establish Pakistan as a responsible nuclear power. It fully understands the international nuclear order and is ready to cooperate and contribute towards it without compromising on its core national interest. It is high time that the international community recognize Pakistan as a responsible nuclear weapons state in the evolving global nuclear order based on mutual trust and respect, transparency and dignity. We make the following five proposals that may help mainstream Pakistan in the international system and assist the international community to understand Pakistan's acute security concerns, its strides towards normative frameworks and its strong qualifications as a responsible nuclear weapons state.\n\nNormalizing the global nuclear order by making it consistent with emerging realities:\n\nFirst, we believe that there is an urgent need to envisage a new consensus on disarmament, arms control, and nonproliferation under the UN Charter, and in accordance with the principle of -- equal security for all.\u201697 This may not be politically viable for some states, but we should not overlook that if the nonproliferation regime secures broader legal legitimacy and uniform criteria binds all states, then this will diminish the possibilities of violation of norms within the regime, too.\n\nSecond, it is necessary to normalize the non-proliferation regime to advance its goals based on the NPT's three pillars -- non-proliferation, disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear technology. The NPT sets the central objective of universal and comprehensive disarmament instead of legitimizing the continued possession and multiplication of nuclear stockpiles by a few states. There is also a need for making progress on NSAs. The Conference on Disarmament should vigorously pursue this issue, which is already on its agenda.\n\nThird, efforts should continue to be made to ensure the safety and security of nuclear weapons and the related materials, technologies and facilities worldwide. The nuclear deal with Iran is a big breakthrough and it would have a far-reaching and salutary impact on the non-proliferation regime and regional stability. In a similar manner, the six-party talks can address the North Korean issue.\n\nFourth, a new broad formula needs to be defined for export control policies that can meet current and future demands. The non-NPT states have a distinct legal persona based on their own security paradigms and imperatives influenced by globalization, the rise in energy demand, information revolution and changing security environment. Efforts should, therefore, be made to create an effective and enduring -- criteria-based approach\u2016 for these states to join the NSG. An additional benefit would be that Pakistan, in its own interest, would continue to respect global non-proliferation norms. The right of peaceful uses of nuclear technology should not be subject to the question of nonproliferation after taking into consideration states' serious nonproliferation commitments and justifiable energy demands. For Pakistan, it is a time-sensitive strategic imperative to reduce power deficiency that plagues its economic development and affects human security. Thus, inclusion of Pakistan in the NSG to preserve its right to peaceful uses of nuclear technology should strengthen, not weaken, the nuclear order.\n\nOnce cooperation is strengthened through such inclusion, trust between Pakistan and the NSG members would grow and as a result uncertainty and fear would decrease. The implementation of this proposal may enable the world to establish and reinforce agreed norms against non-proliferation, promote peace, rule out the dreaded possibility of use of nuclear weapons and realize the right to peaceful uses of nuclear technology.\n\nRegulating India's modernization by addressing the growing conventional force asymmetry\n\nIndia is qualitatively and quantitatively increasing its nuclear stockpiles and modernizing conventional capabilities, and this would certainly increase insecurity of all the states around India and beyond the region.\n\nConsidering South Asia's conflict-driven past, the widening gap in conventional forces and the arrival of nuclear weapons and development of thermonuclear weapons, the great powers can play a crucial role in discouraging states from taking sides and supporting one at the expense of the other. Discriminatory treatment of Pakistan has left it vulnerable to India. This has stepped up arms race in the region and weakened deterrence stability. India, with a greater conventional force capability, may threaten the territorial integrity of the weaker side. The conventionally weaker side, Pakistan, is left with two options for survival. One, it can follow a catalytic doctrinal posture -- that is, to seek the intercession of a third party which could intervene just before a crisis seems to be spinning out of control. Two, it can adopt an asymmetric escalation posture -- that is, to rely on the first use of nuclear weapons, to offset the mightier conventional side of the adversary.\n\nArguably, there is a greater shift of major power from Europe to Asia-Pacific as Asia turns to become a strategic and economic hub in the 21st century, which offers new avenues to these two rival states -- Pakistan and India. The US with its alliances in the Asia Pacific region may continue to nudge India towards resumption and maintenance of a sustainable dialogue process with Pakistan. Instead of creating imbalance by rewarding India with material support, armaments, naval platforms, and new delivery and surveillance means,102 the US can help construct a security regime to address the two states' insecurities and political complexities, particularly in terms of reducing the growing conventional force asymmetry.\n\nAddressing the issues that hinder the arms control regime between India and Pakistan:\n\nThere is an urgent need for both India and Pakistan to realize that the nuclear weapons offer them nothing more than deterrence. At the same time, both states need to clearly establish an understanding that neither the use of total force is feasible nor total victory is possible in a nuclear war. Thus, it is imperative that these two states reengage to create a strategic restraint regime that comprises nuclear and missile restraint, conventional balance and conflict resolution. Pakistan made this proposal to India, shortly after the 1998 nuclear tests, to sustain deterrence stability, avoid the danger of nuclear use and avert a costly and mutually destructive war.\n\nThe creation of an arms control framework between India and Pakistan may not be possible for certain reasons. First, both India and Pakistan are at an early stage of their nuclear weapons development. Until they are out of initial stages of nuclear development, which may include assured second-strike capability, sophisticated delivery systems, and maturation of the security and safety infrastructure, efforts to develop such a framework would have little significance.\n\nSecond, there is a growing conventional disparity between India and Pakistan, which makes it imperative for Pakistan to sustain a higher level of deterrent capability. Both sides may require some level of deterrent force symmetry before they conclude an arms control discussion. The South Asian region must pass through critical learning stages, as the United States and the Soviet Union did during the Cold War period, though the strategic environment and situation between the two South Asian rivals is different and the Cold War nuclear strategies may not necessarily be applicable in the South Asia.\n\nThird, states' war-like doctrinal postures have strategic implications. Despite the understanding that too much openness could undermine the credibility of a state's deterrent, particularly when it is conventionally vulnerable and geographically smaller than its rival, there is still a need for some transparency in nuclear policies, which in turn could help build a stronger framework for arms control processes. Ironically, Pakistan has been drawn into the South Asian arms race because of Indian doctrinal and force posture. The dramatic shifts in both the strategic and conventional deterrent forces of one side would thus have implications for the other, which keeps the clock of a new arms race ticking.

But this year's events must be more than a commemoration -- they should sound the alarm.\n\nTo date, the two US bombings are the only times nuclear weapons have ever been used. But the risk of a repeat has seldom been closer than it is today.\n\nConfrontation between the world's greatest military powers is at boiling point. In Ukraine, invading Russian troops are in direct combat with armed forces equipped and trained by Nato; US and British-supplied rockets are fired on Russian forces.\n\nThis weekend, Chinese military drills involving hypersonic missile strikes, simulated naval blockades and stealth bombers are being held in response to a crass stunt by US Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose Taiwan visit was apparently designed to provoke such a response.\n\nChina has a no-first-use policy on nuclear weapons, but that is no guarantee a clash with the United States in the Pacific would not go nuclear -- particularly since the US navy has deployed smaller, so-called \"tactical\" nuclear warheads to its submarine fleet since 2020.\n\nThese are devices whose very existence is based on the false premise that a nuclear warhead can be a \"battlefield weapon\" and that a nuclear war can be locally contained.\n\nAnd China's no-first-use pledge is rare among nuclear-armed states. Of the others only India has made a similar commitment (the Soviet Union did, but post-Soviet Russia repudiated it in 1993). The US, Britain, France, Russia and Pakistan all reserve the right to use nuclear weapons first, while North Korea and Israel have no explicit policy regarding their use.\n\nThis makes the hot war in Ukraine acutely dangerous.\n\nFrom the beginning Russia has hinted at its readiness to escalate to nuclear conflict, warning Western powers in February of \"consequences you have never seen in your history\" if Nato fights it in Ukraine.\n\nDiscussion of nuclear war as a realistic possibility has become terrifyingly common.\n\nRussian defence committee member Andrey Gurulyov, an MP in Vladimir Putin's United Russia party, spoke on Russian television in June about the early stages of such a war, specifying London as the first city to be hit. In this country, opinion columns in mainstream media outlets like the Telegraph and Observer call for open war with Russia.\n\nWhile the targeting of any civilians in conflict is a war crime that should be investigated and punished, hysterical rhetoric from both Russia and Ukraine has the effect of downplaying how much more horrific things could still get, with Mariupol's deputy mayor Sergeii Orlov comparing the now conquered city's bombardment to the Hiroshima bombing and a Russian occupation official in Novaya Khakovka making the same analogy about a rocket attack on it by Ukraine.\n\nAfter decades of reducing nuclear arsenals, countries are reversing the trend and expanding their size -- not least Britain, in a reckless and catastrophically expensive decision shamefully enjoying Labour support.\n\nThe former government of Donald Trump brought nuclear brinkmanship closer through tearing up the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty as well as the Open Skies policy allowing Russia and the US to conduct overflights across each other's territory.\n\nThough the election of Joe Biden managed to salvage the strategic arms reduction treaty (New Start) with Russia, in other respects he has continued where Trump left off.\n\nPoliticians' current blas\u00e9 approach to nuclear confrontation cannot stand.\n\nAt key points in the cold war, armageddon was avoided by an ability to negotiate and compromise which now seems to be rejected on principle by the heads of Nato states. This recklessness endangers all of us.\n\nOnly a far stronger peace movement can counter the new militarism.

The mass, indiscriminate destruction of a civilian populace which ensued should never be celebrated, even if some (wrongly) think it was necessary. By availing itself of the atomic bomb, the United States changed the world for the worse. It showed that it was willing to engage and embrace mass murder for the sake of its objectives. The world took note, and many countries followed suit, developing atomic weapons themselves. This led to the arms race, a race which added evil upon evil, as more and more countries developed their own atomic and nuclear arsenals so that they could join in with the United States, using their power as a way to bully and blackmail those who did not have such weapons themselves. Obviously, it is because Russia developed such weapons, and still possess them to this day, Putin was able to invade Ukraine, knowing that the response given to the invasion would be limited as the rest of the world did not want to risk nuclear war.\n\nThe United States has helped create the contemporary world order, and with it, suffers much of the blame for the evils which that order produces. It owes the world for the evil it has unleashed. Instead of using its might to take a position of authority and privilege in the world, the United States should serve the rest of the world, working to repair the harm it has caused thanks to its embrace of nuclear weapons.\n\nSadly, the evil behind the use - and possession of - atomic (and nuclear) weapons often gets obscured as those who possess them like the privilege they have, leading them to justify the possession of such arms (and even their use) through consequentialistic reasoning. Of course the justification they gave rightfully scares those who do not possess such weapons themselves, as the justification always shows that those who have such weapons are more than willing to justify their use if and when they think their use is necessary (and of course, what is necessary is always dependent upon the interests of those who have such weapons). This has made for a rather dangerous situation, as more and more countries, like Russia, North Korea, and China, indicate their willingness to use those weapons if they find their dominance in the world is questioned. And so, what should be unthinkable is becoming thinkable, that is, where nuclear annihilation is a real possibility, as UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has recently indicated.\n\nAfter the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Pope after Pope have condemned the use, and possession of, nuclear arms. They have indicated that the use of the atomic bomb was a major crime against humanity, and the cries of the innocent who died from its use goes all the way up to heaven. Likewise, Pope after Pope have also indicated that nuclear deterrence, relying upon the use of evil for some good end, will not work, and in the end, the fact that any country possesses such arms will cause needless troubles in the world. Pope Benedict XVI made this clear, when, in 2010, he said:\n\nThis year marks the 65th anniversary of the tragic atomic bombing of the populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The memory of this sombre episode in the history of humanity becomes more poignant every year, while those who witnessed this horror are disappearing. This tragedy insistently reminds us of how necessary it is to persevere in the effort for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and for disarmament. The nuclear weapon remains a major source of concern. Possession of it and the risk of its possible use give rise to tensions and distrust in many of the world's regions. Your nation, Mr Ambassador, must be cited as an example for its constant support in the search for political solutions that not only make it possible to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, but also to prevent war from being seen as a means to resolve conflicts between nations and between peoples.[1]\n\nWhile it is true, to some extent, that there is a kind of deterrence to be had when multiple nations possess nuclear arms, in reality, all it takes is one bad actor to have the deterrence lead to nuclear annihilation. Such deterrence assumes that all actors will act rationally, that they will want to preserve their own life, but the reality of the world shows not everyone will act in that manner. This is why Pope St. Paul VI said that the so-called \"balance of terror\" is not truly conductive for making peace:\n\nAs you know, the Holy See has never shown itself enthusiastic for the formula of the \"balance of terror\" as a means of safeguarding peace. Without ignoring the practical, even if in cause negative: advantages that such a formula can temporarily present, it has always seemed to this Apostolic See to be too detached from the moral basis upon which alone peace can prosper. It has likewise seemed too extravagant. through continual competition in equalling and surpassing one another in terms of power and arms, too extravagant, we say, of means and energies that ought on the contrary to be devoted to quite other ends - to the well-being and progress of all peoples. It has seemed destructive of thoughts of harmony and mutual understanding; it has seemed, finally, too fragile a shield against the onslaught of temptations to predominance and oppression which are at the root of so many situations of tension and conflict, also because of the justified reasons of defence that they evoke or sometimes, because of the clanger of an erroneous calculation in preventing the feared manifestations resulting to one's own disadvantage.[2]\n\nAll we have to do is look at history, and we will find, time and time again, standoffs eventually leading to conflict, with the so-called Wild West and all the gunfights which took place in it as a representation of this phenomena. Eventually one person or another will give in to their worst impulses and fire. The more nuclear weapons exist in the world, the more likely one bad actor will use them and fire upon others, and then it will become a free for all as the nations of the world end up firing upon each other out of retaliation. Without working to end the standoff by having everyone put away their arms (and in regards nuclear arms, doing away with them), without working for peace and building upon that peace, the threat of nuclear annihilation will always be with us. Pope Benedict XVI indicated the solution lies with the countries and peoples of the world working together, helping each other, building each other up, for when we work for mutual improvement, we begin to look to each other with respect and not as enemies to be feared or hated. To do this properly, we must focus on promoting basic human dignity, and the rights which come from that dignity, for if people are built up and affirmed in this fashion, they will feel less animosity and hostility towards each other:\n\nMultilateralism, for its part, should not be restricted to purely economic and political questions; rather, it should find expression in a resolve to address the whole spectrum of issues linked to the future of humanity and the promotion of human dignity, including secure access to food and water, basic health care, just policies governing commerce and immigration, particularly where families are concerned, climate control and care for the environment, and the elimination of the scourge of nuclear weapons.[3]\n\nWhen we ignore the common good which we should share with each other, and instead, try to take it apart, and use those parts for private pleasure, ignoring the needs of others, it is easy to see how hostilities develop. When we ignore the harm we are doing to the world, such as through climate change, we likewise make the world a worse place to live, with many suffering as a result of those changes; when this goes on for some time, some will feel they have been pushed too far, and so they will react, often with violent means, as a way of trying to regain what they feel has unjustly been taken away from them. For it is clear, as living becomes much and much more difficult, and the pleasures of life less and less apparent, people will become desperate; they will feel as if they have nothing to lose, even if they should die. We must, therefore, take care of the earth, and the good of the earth, making sure it is shared by all and not seen as the exclusive property of a few. But, when the world becomes more divided upon itself, nuclear deterrence will not work, as more and more people will feel such desperation, they will use whatever means they can to get what they want, even if it means using nuclear weapons upon their enemies. In order to make sure that such does not happen, it is important to engage nuclear disarmament, for, as Pope Francis said, the world is presently at a time of crossroads, and what we do now will determine what future, if any, humanity has left in the world:\n\nAt this particular moment in history where the world seems to be at a crossroads, the courageous vision of this legal instrument, strongly inspired by ethical and moral arguments, appears ever more timely. Indeed, this meeting takes place at a moment that inevitably calls for a deeper reflection on security and peace. In the current context, speaking of or advocating disarmament may seem paradoxical to many. However, we need to remain aware of the dangers of short-sighted approaches to national and international security and the risks of proliferation. As we know all too well, the price for not doing so is inevitably paid by the number of innocent lives taken and measured in terms of carnage and destruction. As a result, I emphatically renew my appeal to silence all weapons and eliminate the causes of conflicts through tireless recourse to negotiations: \"Those who wage war [...] forget humanity!\" [4]\n\nEvery nuclear weapon multiplies the risk which we face:\n\nNuclear weapons are a costly and dangerous liability. They represent a \"risk multiplier\" that provides only an illusion of a \"peace of sorts\". Here, I wish to reaffirm that the use of nuclear weapons, as well as their mere possession, is immoral. Trying to defend and ensure stability and peace through a false sense of security and a \"balance of terror\", sustained by a mentality of fear and mistrust inevitably ends up poisoning relationships between peoples and obstructing any possible form of real dialogue. Possession leads easily to threats of their use, becoming a sort of \"blackmail\" that should be repugnant to the consciences of humanity. [5]\n\nEventually someone will resist a nuclear power's threats, and then, either the threat will be shown to have been a bluff, or else, nuclear weapons will be employed, and the world as we know it will likely be over. We cannot stand by and support the argument which promotes the development of nuclear arsenals; we must resist the lure of power, and work, instead, for peace in the world. Again, that means we must work to promote the common good, not just in our own particular country, but for the whole world, so that we make sure such conflicts become rare, and no one feels so desperate that they are willing to risk nuclear annihilation. The United States, sadly, is giving a mixed message. On the one hand, it says:\n\nThe United States is committed to reducing the role of nuclear weapons and re-establishing our leadership on arms control, and we've undertaken a deliberate policy review toward that goal. We'll continue to emphasize strategic stability, seek to avoid costly arms races, facilitate risk reduction and arms control agreements wherever they are possible. [6]\n\nBut, on the other hand, the United States still thinks along the lines that the possession of nuclear arms, at least by some countries, will help promote nuclear deterrence, providing other nations the justification they need to arm themselves:\n\nAnd as long as nuclear weapons exist, the fundamental role of U.S. nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear attacks on the United States, on our allies, and partners. The United States would only consider the use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States, its allies, and partners. [7]\n\nWith Russia's war against Ukraine, with North Korea and its belligerence to the West, with China and its aggressive attitude to the world, those who possess nuclear weapons show they know such weapons do not serve only for deterrence, but also can be used to blackmail the world. Nuclear deterrence will only last so long. If we do not change our ways, if we not work for the elimination of nuclear arms in the world, eventually, as with the gunfights in the Wild West, one side will budge and then the world will see the consequences of the arms race, and the evil which lay behind it.\n\n[3] Pope Benedict XVI, \"Address To His Excellency Mr. Miguel Humberto D\u00edas New Ambassador of the United States to the Holy See.\" Vatican translation (10-2-2009).\n\n[4] Pope Francis, \"Message to Ambassador Alexander Kmentt President Of The First Meeting of State Parties To The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\" Vatican translation (6-21-2022).\n\n[5] Pope Francis, \"Message to Ambassador Alexander Kmentt President Of The First Meeting of State Parties To The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\"\n\n[6] Antony J.

This is taking shape at a crucial moment for the sector. While the government has put nuclear at the heart of its energy strategy and the move towards net-zero, the industry also faces an acute skills crisis.\n\nAs home to Hinkley Point C, one of largest infrastructure projects in Europe, the South West is at the front line of this challenge. Industry, academic institutions and public bodies are working together under Nuclear South West, a private public partnership, to develop, and grow, the region's skills and know-how to exploit the opportunities that Hinkley Point C and the nuclear sector offers.\n\nA report by the Learning and Work Institute (L&W) in 2019 found that the UK skills shortage will cost the country \u00a3120 billion by 2030. These skills include engineers, welders, project and programme managers, scientists, and technologists.\n\nIn addition, the UK's nuclear sector has an ageing workforce just as the sector is poised on the brink of a nuclear renaissance, with the opportunity of Small Modular Reactors, nuclear fusion, and a new wave of nuclear fission plants. Those most able to support this wave are beginning to retire.\n\nThe lack of new talent to the sector in recent years is a legacy of the 1980s, when the future of nuclear power was first called into question and the appeal of the sector began to dwindle as a career choice.\n\nNuclear South West, supported by the Heart of the South West Local Enterprise Partnership, The South West Nuclear Hub and Business West, is taking positive action to address the skills gap, with a focus on education.\n\nAs Stefan Cecchini, Chairman, Nuclear South West, explains: \"Education, and the role that the next generation will play in the nuclear sector, is paramount to the future of this industry. Without the investment and opportunity for training, this sector needs, the future of the nuclear sector was unsettled. Whilst it has become apparent for a number of years that the nuclear industry has a skills gap, the innovative means of counteracting this in the South West are many and we are proud of the many ventures currently in place in our region.\"\n\nA key venture supported by Nuclear South West is the National College for Nuclear (NCfN). Set up in 2016 with the backing of Bridgwater & Taunton College (BTC), NCfN is specifically developing nuclear industry skills. Educational facilities that work alongside BTC to deliver the NCfN's programmes include:\n\nIn the past four years, the NCfN at BTC has grown its curriculum, developing students who are both technically minded and embedded in sector behaviours. The aim is not only supporting the development of engineering talent, but also a broader range of skills such as welders, project managers and construction support.\n\nMatt Tudor, Director of Commercial Development, Strategy and Partnerships at Bridgwater & and Taunton College, and Board Member of NCfN, says: \"The UK Government has committed to a Net Zero economy by 2050 and the NCfN forms a cornerstone of the skills response. Students enrolling with us are keen to be a part of the solution and the opportunities are more exciting than ever. Over one thousand students have graduated from the NCfN at BTC in the past four years, and work at various levels in many sectors of the nuclear industry.\n\nWith the much-awaited release of the Energy Security Strategy in March 2022, nuclear has moved to the heart of the UK's net zero ambitions. Opportunity in the UK for nuclear power is supported by a growing decommissioning portfolio, and significant research and investment in Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), Advanced Modular Reactors (AMRs), and nuclear fusion.\n\nSubject matter experts and research skills gaps are being absorbed by the South West Nuclear Hub at University of Bristol. Its role is to bring together universities and companies in the region to support research, innovation, and skills development for the nuclear industry. Other South West universities supporting this venture are the University of Plymouth, University of Southampton, and UWE Bristol.\n\nJames Barker, Communications and Engagement Coordinator, South West Nuclear Hub, comments: \"In the last six months we have seen major acceleration of government funded commitments to nuclear, creating real momentum around MSc and PhD training with a clear drive to industry led skills for developing new projects and research. Whilst lots of research at the University of Bristol is supporting decommissioning and fission technologies, it also includes growing areas such as our nuclear robotics programmes and fusion-related research. These are vital areas to support UK energy security. Nuclear is gaining both traction and a more positive image with the public, and inspiring a future workforce for the many roles available in the nuclear industry.\"\n\nThe University of Bristol currently supports over 50 PhD research students in nuclear, with 15 to 20 new advertised positions a year. Furthermore, the MSc Nuclear Science and Engineering programme, having started with just five students in 2016, now consistently recruits around 25 students every year. Their exponential growth is testament to the action in place to tackle research gaps in the nuclear industry.\n\nHinkley Point C has already created thousands of jobs in the South West and beyond and is set to create 25,000 more opportunities and inject \u00a3100m a year into the regional economy. Due to open in 2027, Hinkley Point C marks only the beginning of a significant programme of investment in nuclear power right across the UK - the South West's pipeline includes 15 projects worth \u00a350 billion over the next two decades. It is only by taking positive action now to plug the skills gap that the South West, and the UK, will be able to fully realise these opportunities this investment brings to the next generation.", "source": {"uri": "neimagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nuclear Engineering International"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 3, "stanza_neu": 21, "stanza_pos": 14, "swn_neg": 38, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7136103092", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-01", "time": "20:33:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-01T20:33:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-01T20:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5098039507865906, "url": "https://tass.com/world/1487703", "title": "US reduced its nuclear arsenal by about 90% since 1967 - Blinken", "body": "Nuclear weapons states moved toward disarmament, including the United States, US Secretary of State noted\n\nUNITED NATIONS, August 1. /TASS/.

Nuclear is neither sensible nor practical for any country -- even more so for the Philippines.\n\nNuclear power is not a climate solution. A study in 2021 shows that the contribution of nuclear power to mitigate climate change remains -- and is projected to be -- very limited. Current nuclear plans would only avoid at most 2-3 percent of global emissions, and this contribution is seen to decrease further by 2040. In contrast, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -- the world's foremost authority on climate science -- says that wind and solar power can potentially deliver over 33 percent of the total emissions reductions necessary by 2030.\n\nNuclear will not give us energy security and will not provide adequate and reliable power for the Philippines. Nuclear proponents consistently fail to mention the fact that the Philippines does not produce nuclear fuel. We will still be subject to global supply shortages and price fluctuations of nuclear fuel -- and at a worse scale than coal, since only four companies in the world manufacture nuclear fuel. Nuclear power's inflexibility has also been cited by experts as incompatible with the Philippines' energy profile, and will be even more incompatible as the country ramps up its renewable energy (RE) portfolio.\n\nNuclear power will not lower electricity prices for consumers. In fact, it is the most expensive way to produce electricity. Among all types of power plants, it is the most expensive to build and maintain. Slovakia's Mochovce 3 and 4 nuclear power plants, at 470 megawatts each, cost a whopping 5.4 billion euros (or around P288 billion). Meanwhile, the International Energy Association found that in 2020, renewables, particularly solar, were the world's cheapest energy source.\n\nThe price of nuclear energy becomes even more unimaginably expensive when you include the costs for radioactive spent fuel storage, as well as nuclear accidents. The cost of clean up for Fukushima is estimated at 21.5 trillion yen (or around P9 trillion). The recent earthquakes in Abra and Ilocos provinces, and the scale of destruction caused, should make nuclear proponents rethink what they are peddling. If those provinces had nuclear plants, imagine how much worse the situation would have been -- given the lax regulatory culture in the Philippines where building construction is not adequately monitored, and where we can't even effectively monitor air pollution from coal plants.\n\nNuclear is a sunset industry and has been in global decline longer than coal. It is unfortunate and outrageous how the industry continues to find willing proponents in the Philippines who would put fanatical claims over fact, at the expense of climate action and human safety. The era of nuclear power is long gone, and RE is answering the call of the times. The Philippine government should disassociate itself from all these false nuclear myths and carve out a safer, better path with renewables.\n\nKhevin Yu, energy transition campaigner, Greenpeace Philippines", "source": {"uri": "opinion.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 15, "stanza_neu": 10, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 25, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7138554563", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-03", "time": "16:47:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-03T16:47:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-03T15:52:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5058823823928833, "url": "http://saudigazette.com.sa/article/623607/SAUDI-ARABIA/Irans-practices-increase-risks-of-nuclear-proliferation-mdash-Saudi-envoy-to-UN?ref=rss&format=simple&link=link", "title": "Iran's practices increase risks of nuclear proliferation  --  Saudi envoy to UN", "body": "Al-Wasil speaking at the Tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on Wednesday.\n\nSaudi Gazette report\n\nNEW YORK -- Saudi Arabia's new Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Dr. Abdulaziz Al-Wasil said that Iran's practices increase the risks of nuclear proliferation.\n\nAl-Wasil was speaking at the Tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on Wednesday.\n\nHe said that freeing the Middle East from nuclear weapons is a collective responsibility.\n\n\"Transparency is necessary for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.

This happened only a few short weeks after scientists in the U.S. conducted the world's first successful nuclear test.

But at the end of the Cold War in 1992, the U.S. government imposed a moratorium on U.S. testing. This was strengthened by the Clinton administration's decision to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Although the Senate never ratified the treaty and it never entered into force, all 184 countries that signed the test ban, including the U.S., have followed its rules.\n\nBut in recent weeks, the Trump administration and Congress have begun debating whether to restart active testing of nuclear weapons on U.S. soil.\n\nSome conservative Republicans have long expressed concerns over the reliability of aging U.S. warheads and believe that testing is a way to address this problem. Additionally, the U.S., Russia and China are producing novel types of nuclear missiles or other delivery systems and replacing existing nuclear weapons - some of which date to the Cold War - with updated ones. Some politicians in the U.S. are concerned about the reliability of these untested modern weapons as well.\n\nWe are two nuclear weapons researchers - a physicist and an arms control expert - and we believe that there is no value, from either the scientific nor diplomatic perspective, to be gained from resuming testing. In fact, all the evidence suggests that such a move would threaten U.S. national security.\n\nWhy did the US stop testing?\n\nSince the Trinity Test in July 1945, the U.S. has detonated 215 warheads above ground and 815 underground. These were done to test new weapon designs and also to ensure the reliability of older ones.\n\nWhen the Cold War ended, the U.S. pledged to stop doing such tests and a group within the United Nations began putting together the CTBT. The goal of the test ban treaty was to hinder new nations from developing nuclear arsenals and limit the capabilities of nations that already had them.\n\nSubcritical testing to maintain the arsenal\n\nAfter the U.S moratorium went into effect, the U.S. Department of Energy created a massive program called the Stockpile Stewardship Program to maintain the safety and reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons. Instead of crudely blowing up weapons to produce a nuclear explosion, scientists at facilities like U1A in Nevada began conducting what are called subcritical tests.\n\n[Expertise in your inbox. Sign up for The Conversation's newsletter and get expert takes on today's news, every day.]\n\nIn these tests, the plutonium that drives the nuclear chain reactions is replaced by a similar-acting but non-nuclear explosive material such as tungsten or a modified plutonium shell. There is still a big bang, but no nuclear chain reaction.\n\nRather, these experiments produce data that researchers feed into elaborate supercomputer programs built using the massive amounts of information collected from earlier live tests. Using these subcritical tests and earlier data, scientists can simulate full-scale detonations with incredible accuracy and monitor the current arsenal without blowing up nuclear warheads.\n\nWhat could be going wrong in the bombs?\n\nAll nuclear weapons currently in the U.S. stockpile are two-stage nuclear weapons called hydrogen bombs. Put simply, hydrogen bombs work by using a smaller nuclear bomb - akin to the bomb dropped on Nagasaki - to detonate a second, much more powerful bomb.\n\nNearly all the components of a nuclear weapon can be replaced and updated except for one piece - the explosive plutonium core known as the pit. These pits are what trigger the second, larger explosion.\n\nThe weapons in the U.S. arsenal are, on average, about 25 years old. The main concern of people pushing to resume testing is that the plutonium pits may have deteriorated from their own radiation in the time since they were made and will not properly trigger the second fusion stage of the explosion.\n\nSince most of the previous tests were done on much younger bombs with newer plutonium pits, supporters of testing claim that the subcritical tests cannot accurately test this part of the process.\n\nThe deterioration of the plutonium pit is a valid concern. To study this, researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory used a far more radioactive type of plutonium and artificially aged the metal to simulate the effects of what would be equivalent to 150 years of radiation on a normal plutonium pit. They found that the aged plutonium pits \"will retain their size, shape, and strength despite increasing damage from self-irradiation,\" and concluded that \"the pits will function as designed up to 150 years after they have been manufactured.\"\n\nThis isn't to say that scientists can stop worrying about the aging of U.S. nuclear weapons. It's important to continue \"to assess and, if necessary mitigate threats to primary performance caused by plutonium aging\", as the JASON group - a group of elite scientists that advises the U.S. government - says.\n\nHowever, these scientists do not suggest that it is necessary to conduct live nuclear tests. Decades of experimental studies by nuclear weapons laboratories have led experts to believe that the U.S. can maintain the nuclear arsenal without testing. And in fact, as the former director of Los Alamos National Labs, Dr. Sigfried Hecker said recently, many believe that by resuming testing, \"we would lose more than we gain.\"\n\nLittle to gain, much to lose\n\nNuclear weapons are intricately tied to the world of geopolitics. So if there isn't a scientific need to resume testing, is there some political or economic reason?\n\nThe U.S. has already spent tens of billions of dollars on the infrastructure needed to conduct subcritical tests. Additionally, a new, billion-dollar facility is currently being built in Nevada that will provide even finer detail to the data from subcritical test explosions. Once subcritical test facilities are up and running, it is relatively inexpensive to run experiments. Nuclear testing won't save the U.S. money.\n\nSo is it politics?\n\nCurrently, nuclear powers around the world are all improving the missiles that carry nuclear warheads, but not yet the warheads themselves.\n\nWith little evidence, the Trump administration has sought to sow suspicion that Russia and China may be secretly conducting very low-yield nuclear tests, implying that the countries are trying to build better nuclear warheads. In response, movement towards testing in the U.S. has already begun.\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee recently approved an amendment to spend US$10 million to cut the time it would take to conduct a test if the president ordered one. Some officials seem to believe that a resumption of U.S. testing - or the threat of it - could give Washington an upper hand in future arms control negotiations.\n\nBut we believe the opposite to be true. Even though the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty has not entered into force, nearly every nuclear power on earth has more or less followed its rules. But if the U.S. were to resume nuclear testing, it would be a green light for all other nations to start their own testing.\n\nThe U.S. already has the ability to perform subcritical tests and data from over 1,000 test detonations that scientists can use to modernize, improve and maintain the current arsenal. No other country, aside from Russia, has as robust a foundation. If the ban were broken, it would give other countries like Iran, India, Pakistan and China a chance to gather huge amounts of information and improve their weapons while the U.S. would gain next to nothing.\n\nWhen it comes to the U.S nuclear testing ban, our view is, if it ain't broke don't fix it.\n\nThis story was updated on August 3, 2020 to refer to the 75th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Pomper - Middlebury\n\n(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.)\n\nFerenc Dalnoki-Veress, Middlebury and Miles A. Pomper, Middlebury\n\n(THE CONVERSATION) More than seventy five years ago, on August 6, 1945, a U.S. plane dropped a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. This happened only a few short weeks after scientists in the U.S. conducted the world's first successful nuclear test. The Trinity Test, in New Mexico's Jornada del Muerto desert, proved that the design of the bomb worked and started the nuclear era.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But at the end of the Cold War in 1992, the U.S. government imposed a moratorium on U.S. testing. This was strengthened by the Clinton administration's decision to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Although the Senate never ratified the treaty and it never entered into force, all 184 countries that signed the test ban, including the U.S., have followed its rules.\n\nBut in recent weeks, the Trump administration and Congress have begun debating whether to restart active testing of nuclear weapons on U.S. soil.\n\nSome conservative Republicans have long expressed concerns over the reliability of aging U.S. warheads and believe that testing is a way to address this problem. Additionally, the U.S., Russia and China are producing novel types of nuclear missiles or other delivery systems and replacing existing nuclear weapons - some of which date to the Cold War - with updated ones. Some politicians in the U.S. are concerned about the reliability of these untested modern weapons as well.\n\nWe are two nuclear weapons researchers - a physicist and an arms control expert - and we believe that there is no value, from either the scientific nor diplomatic perspective, to be gained from resuming testing. In fact, all the evidence suggests that such a move would threaten U.S. national security.\n\nWhy did the US stop testing?\n\nSince the Trinity Test in July 1945, the U.S. has detonated 215 warheads above ground and 815 underground. These were done to test new weapon designs and also to ensure the reliability of older ones.\n\nWhen the Cold War ended, the U.S. pledged to stop doing such tests and a group within the United Nations began putting together the CTBT. The goal of the test ban treaty was to hinder new nations from developing nuclear arsenals and limit the capabilities of nations that already had them.\n\nSubcritical testing to maintain the arsenal\n\nAfter the U.S moratorium went into effect, the U.S. Department of Energy created a massive program called the Stockpile Stewardship Program to maintain the safety and reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons. Instead of crudely blowing up weapons to produce a nuclear explosion, scientists at facilities like U1A in Nevada began conducting what are called subcritical tests.\n\n[Expertise in your inbox. Sign up for The Conversation's newsletter and get expert takes on today's news, every day.]\n\nIn these tests, the plutonium that drives the nuclear chain reactions is replaced by a similar-acting but non-nuclear explosive material such as tungsten or a modified plutonium shell. There is still a big bang, but no nuclear chain reaction.\n\nRather, these experiments produce data that researchers feed into elaborate supercomputer programs built using the massive amounts of information collected from earlier live tests. Using these subcritical tests and earlier data, scientists can simulate full-scale detonations with incredible accuracy and monitor the current arsenal without blowing up nuclear warheads.\n\nWhat could be going wrong in the bombs?\n\nAll nuclear weapons currently in the U.S. stockpile are two-stage nuclear weapons called hydrogen bombs. Put simply, hydrogen bombs work by using a smaller nuclear bomb - akin to the bomb dropped on Nagasaki - to detonate a second, much more powerful bomb.\n\nNearly all the components of a nuclear weapon can be replaced and updated except for one piece - the explosive plutonium core known as the pit. These pits are what trigger the second, larger explosion.\n\nThe weapons in the U.S. arsenal are, on average, about 25 years old. The main concern of people pushing to resume testing is that the plutonium pits may have deteriorated from their own radiation in the time since they were made and will not properly trigger the second fusion stage of the explosion.\n\nSince most of the previous tests were done on much younger bombs with newer plutonium pits, supporters of testing claim that the subcritical tests cannot accurately test this part of the process.\n\nThe deterioration of the plutonium pit is a valid concern. To study this, researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory used a far more radioactive type of plutonium and artificially aged the metal to simulate the effects of what would be equivalent to 150 years of radiation on a normal plutonium pit. They found that the aged plutonium pits \"will retain their size, shape, and strength despite increasing damage from self-irradiation,\" and concluded that \"the pits will function as designed up to 150 years after they have been manufactured.\"\n\nThis isn't to say that scientists can stop worrying about the aging of U.S. nuclear weapons. It's important to continue \"to assess and, if necessary mitigate threats to primary performance caused by plutonium aging\", as the JASON group - a group of elite scientists that advises the U.S. government - says.\n\nHowever, these scientists do not suggest that it is necessary to conduct live nuclear tests. Decades of experimental studies by nuclear weapons laboratories have led experts to believe that the U.S. can maintain the nuclear arsenal without testing. And in fact, as the former director of Los Alamos National Labs, Dr. Sigfried Hecker said recently, many believe that by resuming testing, \"we would lose more than we gain.\"\n\nLittle to gain, much to lose\n\nNuclear weapons are intricately tied to the world of geopolitics. So if there isn't a scientific need to resume testing, is there some political or economic reason?\n\nThe U.S. has already spent tens of billions of dollars on the infrastructure needed to conduct subcritical tests. Additionally, a new, billion-dollar facility is currently being built in Nevada that will provide even finer detail to the data from subcritical test explosions. Once subcritical test facilities are up and running, it is relatively inexpensive to run experiments. Nuclear testing won't save the U.S. money.\n\nSo is it politics?\n\nCurrently, nuclear powers around the world are all improving the missiles that carry nuclear warheads, but not yet the warheads themselves.\n\nWith little evidence, the Trump administration has sought to sow suspicion that Russia and China may be secretly conducting very low-yield nuclear tests, implying that the countries are trying to build better nuclear warheads. In response, movement towards testing in the U.S. has already begun.\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee recently approved an amendment to spend US$10 million to cut the time it would take to conduct a test if the president ordered one. Some officials seem to believe that a resumption of U.S. testing - or the threat of it - could give Washington an upper hand in future arms control negotiations.\n\nBut we believe the opposite to be true.

Topeka for the last time in March 2000, it was a nuclear-powered submarine in the Los Angeles class. I served four years in the vessel's reactor compartment as a nuclear reactor operator. At the time, the vessel did not carry any nuclear missiles.\n\nNow, a decision to add them to the Topeka and other similar submarines risks the lives of the submariners on board and the American people.\n\nDuring my service, the Navy used two types of nuclear submarines. The ballistic submarine, intended to act as a deterrent to any pre-emptive nuclear strike by another country with nuclear capabilities, and the fast attack submarine, designed to spy and gather surveillance. In 2018, the Trump administration considered retrofitting in-service fast attack submarines with nuclear weapons. Today, nuclear submarines have, once again, become a hot topic, with $25 million allocated to sea-launched cruise missiles (SLCM-Ns) in the FY23 National Defense Authorization Act. The House passed the NDAA but the Senate, the eventual conference committee between the two, and the appropriations committees all have opportunities to help stop this. Depending on the outcome, future submariners' lives may become more imperiled.\n\nSubmarines carried nuclear devices from 1959 until 1991, when President George H. W. Bush ordered the withdrawal of all nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles from submarines. In 2010, the Obama administration recommended the Navy retire its nuclear cruise missiles, stating that the United States could continue to support its allies in Asia without these missiles, and the Navy completed their retirement in 2013. In 2018, the Trump administration issued its Nuclear Posture Review, focusing on eliminating perceived gaps in the U.S. nuclear arsenal and proposing the redeployment of nuclear cruise missiles on Navy submarines.\n\nIn 2022, the Biden administration sent its Nuclear Posture Review to Congress, with the cancellation of SLCM-Ns as a top priority.\n\nHowever, despite both Biden and Navy officials opposing the SLCM-N, other actors in Congress want to see these missiles stay.\n\nThere are numerous reasons to discontinue the use of SLCM-Ns with a primary one being its price tag. As of 2019, it was estimated that the missile program would cost $9 billion from 2019-2028. This projection does not account for production costs after 2028, nor does it factor in costs associated with integrating the missiles on ships.\n\nAnother reason is that the United States already has a wide array of non-strategic nuclear capabilities, making SLCM-Ns unnecessary. From heavy bombers equipped to carry gravity bombs, to air-launched cruise missiles, to short-range fighter jets, the allocation of funds to the development of SLCM-Ns is redundant. Additionally, funding the SLCM-N program will impact conventional Navy missions and the vital work being done on these vessels at present.\n\nFinally, nuclear submarines pose numerous hazards to those on board. The sailors aboard these vessels face risks from high voltage electricity, high pressure air and water, and various toxic chemicals. Any major accident onboard a vessel could cause the entire crew to be lost at sea. Additionally, while nuclear-powered submarines are configured to mitigate most radiation exposure, there is still some opportunity for those on board to be exposed.\n\nPerhaps the greatest risk of working aboard a nuclear submarine is the disastrous consequences of using a nuclear missile. The use of one nuclear weapon has exponential effects, which risk the lives of everyone across the globe. When sailors take their oaths upon entering the military, they commit to protecting their fellow citizens. However, the dangers posed by the use of SLCM-Ns run counter to this mission.\n\nPresently, the United States military has a well-equipped stockpile of nuclear weapons.

The facts suggest otherwise.\n\nDisasters clearly reduce appetite among the public and policymakers for nuclear power.\n\nBefore the 2011 Fukushima incident, Japan had planned to increase its dependence on nuclear, with half of the country's electricity forecast to come from the energy source by 2030, compared with around a third in 2010. But after Fukushima, the Japanese government took all 54 of the country's nuclear plants offline for safety checks. By 2012 the share of nuclear in the country's electricity mix had dropped to 14 per cent, and by 2020 it was down to less than 5 per cent. Other countries, like Germany, opted to phase out nuclear power completely after the disaster.\n\nToday, new nuclear construction projects are few and far between, even in countries such as France and the US whose energy systems are heavily reliant on the technology, and the number of operational reactors is in decline globally.\n\n[See also: What do Russia's Nord Stream 1 cuts mean for Europe's gas supply?]\n\nIn addition to safety concerns, rising costs are a central reason why the number of new plants under construction remains limited. Since 2011, nuclear power construction costs globally have doubled or even tripled. China is, however, notable in its nuclear ambitions. The country is planning at least 150 new reactors in the next 15 years, more than the rest of the world has built in the past 35, though cost could ultimately change this direction of travel.\n\nOthers countries such as the UK, the US and Canada also see a limited role for new nuclear as part of their response to climate change. The UK government in its 2021 net zero strategy talked about \"cutting edge new nuclear power stations\", and plans to launch a \u00a3120m Future Nuclear Enabling Fund.\n\nThere are some big nuclear power stations on the cards - think Hinkley Point C or Sizewell C in the UK. But the major excitement among many nuclear enthusiasts, including plenty of UK MPs is around so-called small modular reactors (SMRs). If you believe the hype, they are the answer to all climate and energy ills.\n\nLike with so many things to do with nuclear, no one can quite agree. \"Big is best\" has, until now, been the mantra in the vain hope of keeping costs down by creating economies of scale. Big is usually taken to mean a 1,500-1,700 megawatt nuclear power station, while an SMR would be a 300 MW or less reactor. The offering from Rolls Royce - the major player in the field in the UK - would have the capacity to generate 470 MW of energy. When built, such a reactor would have a footprint around the size of two football pitches.\n\nRolls Royce, and companies working on the technology in other countries, argue that smaller solutions can be constructed more cheaply and come online more quickly as they can be built in a factory, transported in modules and fitted together \"like meccano\", said Rolls Royce's Alastair Evans. Large nuclear plants are built fully onsite. The idea is that the modules could then be mass produced. However, nothing is rolling off any conveyor belts yet. The only SMR up and running in the world is a 35 MW floating nuclear plant in Russia.\n\n[See also: How Putin's aggression has nurtured Germany's climate ambitions]\n\nUnlikely.\n\n\"To meet the requirements of the sixth carbon budget, we will need all new cars, vans and replacement boilers to be zero carbon in operation by the early 2030s,\" Virginia Crosbie, a Conservative MP from Wales and the original self-proclaimed \"atomic kitten\", enthused to fellow MPs. \"We must quickly move away from generating that electricity from fossil fuels... Nuclear power, which has been a neglected part of our energy mix, can bridge the gap.\"\n\nThere is, however, no silver bullet to the climate crisis, and renewables, in conjunction with other existing technologies, look like a better, cheaper solution.\n\nFor nuclear in general, power stations that are already online and safe should probably stay online for now as they are a low-carbon solution.\n\nHowever, traditional, big nuclear projects look likely to provide only a sliver of the world's electricity in the future. They are hugely expensive to build, their construction runs over time, and they are frequently struck by technological issues. Moreover, they need to be built close to the sea or a large river for cooling reasons, highlighted Paul Dorfman from the University of Sussex. France has already had to curtail nuclear power output in periods of heatwaves and drought, which are only set to get worse as climate change takes hold. Greater storm surges and eroding coastlines also don't make the prospect of building by the sea any easier.\n\nSMRs solve few of these issues.\n\n\"The modular construction helps to cure issues that have been experienced with past nuclear projects, such as financing, long construction timelines and cost,\" said Crosbie. But many energy experts disagree.\n\n\"The latest economic estimates available for SMRs are still quite expensive relative to other 'clean' energy alternatives, and it would be pure speculation to assume that will change dramatically until the concept has been more proven,\" said Mike Hogan from the not-for-profit Regulatory Assistance Project.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, we need to reduce emissions globally by 45 per cent by 2030 to meet net zero by 2050, according the International Energy Agency, while the UK government has committed to decarbonise its domestic power system by 2035.\n\nIf we take the UK as an example, Hinkley Point C has been delayed and will now not come online until summer 2026 at the earliest. Sizewell C, if built, would not produce electricity until the 2030s. SMRs could be up and running as soon as 2028, claimed Crosbie, but even Rolls Royce says it wouldn't have a SMR online until around 2031.\n\n\"Once commercialised, SMRs could be out of the door quicker than traditional power stations. But the designs still need to get licensed, factories need to be built, orders placed, projects financed, etc,\" said Hogan.\n\nIn short, it is difficult to see how a technology that will only be operational after the UK power system is supposed to be carbon-free will contribute to climate action in the next ten years or so. And the situation is similar globally.\n\nOther questions around traditional nuclear power stations, such as the thorny issue of waste, would also still apply to SMRs.\n\nIn short, yes. The costs of solar, wind power and storage continue to fall, and by 2026 global renewable electricity capacity is forecast to rise by more than 60 per cent, to a level that would equal the current total global power capacity of fossil fuels and nuclear combined, says the IEA.\n\nSome argue nuclear can be a clean back-up option for when the wind doesn't blow and the sun isn't shining. But again, other options already exist, including demand response (for example, plugging in your electric car when there is lots of energy and not switching on your washing machine when the system is under strain), large-scale storage and interconnections between different countries.\n\n[See also: Deregulation will worsen the climate crisis and Boris Johnson knows it]\n\nCraig Bennett, chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, summed up the general mood of those less enthused by nuclear than Crosbie and her fans: \"If successive governments had given even half the love and attention they afford to nuclear power to scaling up home insulation, energy efficiency and smart storage technologies, it's likely we wouldn't be facing current challenges around energy and household bills, and we would have done a lot more good for the climate and nature.\"\n\nIf nuclear is to play a role in the climate crisis, the industry - big and small - will have to do a much better job of delivering what it claims it can, on time and at a competitive cost.", "source": {"uri": "newstatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Statesman"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.newstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/GettyImages-476794182-1038x778.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 28, "stanza_neu": 30, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 61, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7137342904", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "18:55:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T18:55:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T18:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4980392158031464, "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/diplomacy/news/un-peacekeepers-more-bangladesh-go-africa-3086301", "title": "UN peacekeepers: More from Bangladesh to go to Africa", "body": "UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said more peacekeepers, weapons, and ammunition would soon be taken from Bangladesh for various peacekeeping missions in Africa.\n\nHe said this when Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen requested him to recruit more Bangladeshi peacekeepers, during a meeting on the sidelines of the 10th Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in New York on Monday.\n\nMomen also requested Guterres to appoint more Bangladeshi officials to different political and military positions at the UN Headquarters.\n\nUN Secretary-General applauded Bangladesh's significant contribution to the UN peacekeeping operations and conveyed the gratitude of the international community to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for providing shelter to the Rohingyas and offering continued humanitarian assistance to them.\n\nAddressing the NPT Conference at the UNGA Hall, Foreign Minister Momen urged the international community to unite against the perpetual holding of nuclear weapons by a handful of nations in total disregard for the safety and security of humanity.\n\nHe reiterated Bangladesh's support to the effective implementation of the NPT through its three pillars -- nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\n\nHe emphasised the need for non-discriminatory implementation of Article IV of the Treaty, which recognises the inalienable rights of all countries to develop, research, produce, and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, including power generation, healthcare, and agriculture.\n\nThe foreign minister called for increased investment and international cooperation in the research of nuclear technology and exploring the potentials of its peaceful use for the benefit of humankind.\n\nMentioning the expenditure of $82.4 billion in 2021 for the upkeep of nuclear weapons amid the pandemic, he urged the states to stop senseless investments in destructive nuclear weapons and instead redirect these resources to promote health, address climate change, achieve the SDGs, and promote peace and stability.\n\nBangladesh acceded to the NPT on September 27, 1979, and was among the first few countries to ratify the Treaty on Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) in 2019.\n\nMomen also held bilateral meetings with Slovenia's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Tanja Fajon;

A nuclear-armed North Korea poses an entirely different threat not only to South Korea but also to Northeast Asia as a whole.\n\nHence North Korea must be denuclearized for the peace not only of the Korean peninsula but also the whole international community.\n\nIn 2018, North Korea defined \"denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula\" as \"removing all elements of nuclear threats from the areas of both the north and the south of Korea and also from surrounding areas from where the Korean peninsula is targeted.\"\n\nOfficials with U.S. President Joe Biden's administration have begun emphasising the \"denuclearisation of North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea wants normal relations with the US and acceptance as a nuclear weapons state,\" is a refrain we have heard often during 13 years of routine negotiations and discussions with senior North Korean officials. It started in 2003 with formal Six Party Talks negotiations in Beijing, continued in the following years with senior North Korean officials in Pyongyang, Singapore and Europe, and ended in September 2016 in a Track 1.5 conference in Kuala Lumpur with the North Korean vice foreign minister.\n\nIn all these discussions, North Korea argued for normal relations with the US and acceptance as a nuclear weapons state, as the US did with Pakistan, maintaining that it would be a good friend to the US and a responsible nuclear weapons state.\n\nThe US response over this period has been consistent: It would never accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state for two main reasons. First, due to concerns about a nuclear arms race in the region among countries like South Korea and Japan, who have expressed interest in also pursuing nuclear weapons despite US extended nuclear deterrence commitments. And second, because of the possibility of nuclear weapons and/or fissile material finding their way from North Korea to rogue states and non-state terrorist actors.\n\nInterestingly, the North Korean officials that were spoken to seemingly accepted this US position and, once presented, stopped pursuing this issue. It seemed at the time that they were simply reciting a required talking point, which once covered, they could move on to other subjects.\n\nWhat was consistent during these discussions was that once the subject of retaining nuclear weapons was off the table, these senior North Korean officials then spent considerable time talking about their desire for good relations with the US; maintaining their pursuit of nuclear weapons was for security and deterrence purposes. With security assurances and normal relations with the US, nuclear weapons would not be needed.\n\nDuring the past 26 years, we have had fleeting success in negotiations with North Korea. The 1994 Agreed Framework committed North Korea to freeze and eventually dismantle its plutonium production reactor at Yongbyon in exchange for the US (and others) building two light water reactors in Kumho, North Korea. It also committed the North to stop construction of two additional nuclear reactors: a 50 MWe reactor at Yongbyon and a 200 MWe reactor at Taechon.\n\nThis agreement ended in late 2002 when North Korea was accused of having a secret uranium enrichment program for nuclear weapons, a violation of the spirit of the Agreed Framework. The US halted construction of the light water reactors, and North Korea, after an eight-year freeze on plutonium separation at their 5 MWe reactor, reactivated it and commenced with the reprocessing of spent fuel rods for nuclear weapons. The 50 and 200 MWe reactors were never reactivated.\n\nAt the request of the United States, China launched the Six Party Talks with North Korea in August 2003.

As Germany is about to put the cold in \"cold turkey\" in its winter withdrawal from their addiction to cheap Russian energy, they're starting to question many of their previous decisions. Earlier this week, the Washington Post reported that Berlin wants to spin up its coal-fueled generation plants to make up for the shortfall in Russian natural gas, along with several other European nations.\n\nAt the time, I mentioned that any serious effort to remain \"green\" would include a new look at nuclear power as well. Lo and behold, the Wall Street Journal reports, Germany has second thoughts about shutting down those plants too:\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said for the first time that his government could postpone the planned closure of its remaining nuclear reactors, as he criticized a decision by Russia to constrain gas flows to Germany -- a move that could deal a severe blow to Europe's largest economy. ...\n\nOn Tuesday, the chancellor broke with a longstanding policy and said for the first time that it \"could make sense\" to keep Germany's last three nuclear reactors online. They are due to be shut down in December as part of the country's transition to renewable energy.\n\nGermany decided to phase out nuclear power over two decades ago, a plan that was greatly accelerated by former Chancellor Angela Merkel following the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in 2011.\n\nThe three remaining reactors generate 6% of Germany's electricity. Plans to replace them with gas were upset by the economic war with Russia, Germany's main energy supplier.\n\nThe news comes as the global energy crisis, soaring prices for fossil fuels and climate concerns stir new interest in nuclear power. Some argue that nuclear power will be needed as a bridge as the world transitions to renewable energy. The U.K., Poland and the Netherlands all plan to build new nuclear reactors.\n\nAhem. Nuclear power is in fact a \"renewable energy\" source. It has waste products, but so do the building of solar arrays, windmills, and batteries too. The technology on nuclear power generation has improved the waste issue, although it hasn't eliminated it. Energy creates waste in some form or another, and the challenge for all platforms is how to minimize it while making the best use of those sources -- a point that we hear about when it comes to favored sources, but which suddenly become insurmountable with oil, gas, coal, and nuclear.\n\nThe problem Germany faces is that their remaining nuclear plants don't necessarily provide enough scalability to replace their cheap Russian energy. That six percent will only go up slightly in real terms if these stations pass the stress tests that Scholz plans to conduct to make sure they're operable for a few more years. It might not even last that long, as the Greens are still digging in their heels about shutting down nuclear power in all but the short term:\n\nSome Greens recently indicated a degree of openness to allowing one or more reactors to keep running for a short period with their existing fuel rods, if the country faces a power supply emergency. Officials from the party have stressed that gas is a factor primarily in powering industry and heating homes, more than generating electricity, and nuclear power wouldn't help with that.\n\nPerhaps not this winter so much, especially since this will only keep production at its usual level. Germany could reorient its power infrastructure to switch residential and commercial heating to electric, but that would take a large investment in scalable electricity production -- and that won't come from wind and solar. The only technologies that will provide that flexibility are fossil fuels -- especially coal, which is in large domestic supply in Germany -- and nuclear.\n\nIf Germany is serious about going \"green\" for real and ending its hypocritical reliance on hostile-nation-supplied energy imports, then they either have to choose coal or nuclear power, or choose to revert back to an agrarian, non-industrial state. If they keep refusing to grow up and make an honest and responsible choice, the collapse into a pre-industrial state may end up being imposed upon them ... along with all of the human misery that status will create.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_morrissey@hotair.com", "name": "Ed Morrissey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/o/2018/270/7b8c5b6e-2583-435a-b905-0af1a025eb00-1200x630.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 19, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 31, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7137622412", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-03", "time": "01:50:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-03T01:50:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-03T01:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4901960790157318, "url": "https://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/leaders-must-heed-warning-of-growing-nuclear-threat-41886142.html", "title": "Leaders must heed warning of growing nuclear threat", "body": "Demonstrators hold signs during a gathering in support of US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's expected visit, in Taipei, Taiwan August 2, 2022.

It is a waste of ammunition.\" Yet such advance notice that we are on the brink of damning ourselves as that delivered by UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres can only be ignored at our peril. As he sees it, we are \"one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation\".\n\nGiven heightened tensions, the recklessness of leaders and so many global flashpoints, he believes: \"We have been extraordinarily lucky so far.\"\n\nBut sadly, as he also points out, luck is not a strategy. Citing Russia's war with Ukraine and tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the Middle East, Mr Guterres said he feared that crises \"with nuclear undertones\" could escalate.\n\nThe remarks set the backdrop for a hair-trigger trip to Taiwan by US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Whether or not she has full White House sanction, it could not be more controversial as she is second in the line of succession to the US presidency and a consistent critic of China.\n\nIt will do nothing to help worsening relations between Washington and Beijing. The rationale may be that if successful, it may ultimately avoid a crisis in the Taiwan Strait. Should it backfire it could precipitate one. It may also encourage other world leaders to show support for Taiwan.\n\nGiven the amount of naval and aerial military manoeuvres in the South China Sea, there is no room for a slip-up. Nearly 13,000 nuclear weapons are held in arsenals worldwide, according to Mr Guterres. He said states were \"seeking false security in stockpiling and spending hundreds of billions of dollars on doomsday weapons that have no place on our planet\".\n\nSimilar anxieties were expressed earlier this summer when a Stockholm-based arms research group said it saw a \"very worrying trend\" of all nuclear-armed states upgrading their stockpiles and the post-Cold War era of declining nuclear arsenals may be ending.

We confirm that by ratifying relevant protocols to the treaties establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones, we have undertaken legally binding obligations to respect the status of such zones and not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against States Parties to such treaties.\n\nWe further recall our ratification or support for ratification of the relevant protocols to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, and the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia. We further note our readiness to engage with parties to the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in order to sign the revised protocol without delay.\n\nOur governments further reaffirm our national positive security assurances referenced in UNSCRs 255 (1968) and 984 (1995). We recognize the necessity of providing or supporting immediate assistance to any NNWS Party to the NPT that is an object of a threat of or act of aggression involving the use of nuclear weapons. We recall that UNSCR 984 also invited UN Member States to take appropriate measures in response to a request for technical, medical, scientific or humanitarian assistance from a non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the NPT that is a victim of an act of aggression with nuclear weapons. Forms of relevant assistance may include radiological emergency response, detection and assessment, and environmental mitigation as may be made available by UN Member States or relevant international organizations.", "source": {"uri": "state.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "United States Department of State"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/S_gold_edited.png", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 2, "stanza_neu": 8, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 11, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7139809985", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-04", "time": "15:35:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-04T15:35:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-04T15:35:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4901960790157318, "url": "https://www.plenglish.com/news/2022/08/04/dprk-warns-that-it-will-not-tolerate-threats-to-its-sovereignty/", "title": "DPRK warns that it will not tolerate threats to its sovereignty", "body": "It was the response given by the DPRK permanent representation at the United Nations in a statement released by the news agency, regarding the campaign of confrontation orchestrated by the United States and its satellites at the 10th Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\n\nAccording to the North Korean diplomatic mission, the questioning by the US Government and its allies to the right of self-defense of Democratic Korea expressed in that meeting is absurd and unfair.\n\n\"A long time ago, our country withdrew from the NPT through legal procedures, according to the article stipulated in the treaty, and therefore, no one has the right or the justification to censor the exercise of self-defense by the DPRK,\" the statement said.\n\nThe diplomatic delegation reiterated that the United States is the main violator of the principle of nuclear non-proliferation, and resorts to threats and blackmail with the use of nuclear weapons against sovereign nations, in a clear violation of the NPT.\n\nThe DPRK recalled that the treaty is based on nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, which Washington unhesitatingly violates by deploying nuclear weapons abroad on the basis of its hegemonic strategy.", "source": {"uri": "plenglish.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Agencia Informativa Latinamericana Prensa Latina"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.plenglish.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4._Identificador_Vertical_Color-Institucional-1.png", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 3, "stanza_neu": 2, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 5, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7136732281", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "10:03:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T10:03:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T09:57:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4862745106220245, "url": "https://www.nknews.org/?p=917712", "title": "UN nonproliferation conference won't curtail North Korean nukes: Experts | NK News", "body": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (center) talking with nuclear scientists at an undisclosed location | Image: KCNA (March 9, 2016)\n\nA major conference on nuclear nonproliferation kicked off at the U.N. on Monday, but experts say discussions at the nearly monthlong event are unlikely to do much to advance efforts to stop North Korea's weapons program, even as Pyongyang appears set to conduct a seventh nuclear test.\n\nSignatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) have gathered in New York the long-delayed NPT Review Conference, where they will discuss ways to strengthen and implement the pact through Aug. 26.\n\nThe conference, originally slated for 2020 but pushed back due to COVID-19, comes", "source": {"uri": "nknews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "North Korea News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.nknews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ST_20180423_VNKIM1_3929874-535x325.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 2, "stanza_neu": 2, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 4, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7140517214", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-05", "time": "06:45:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-05T06:45:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-05T06:21:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4862745106220245, "url": "https://www.no2nuclearpower.org.uk/news/npt-5-8-22/", "title": "NPT - No2NuclearPower", "body": "NPT Review Conference: Will it rise to the proliferation challenges?

Pomper - Middlebury\n\n(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.)\n\nFerenc Dalnoki-Veress, Middlebury and Miles A. Pomper, Middlebury\n\n(THE CONVERSATION) More than seventy five years ago, on August 6, 1945, a U.S. plane dropped a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. This happened only a few short weeks after scientists in the U.S. conducted the world's first successful nuclear test. The Trinity Test, in New Mexico's Jornada del Muerto desert, proved that the design of the bomb worked and started the nuclear era.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But at the end of the Cold War in 1992, the U.S. government imposed a moratorium on U.S. testing. This was strengthened by the Clinton administration's decision to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Although the Senate never ratified the treaty and it never entered into force, all 184 countries that signed the test ban, including the U.S., have followed its rules.\n\nBut in recent weeks, the Trump administration and Congress have begun debating whether to restart active testing of nuclear weapons on U.S. soil.\n\nSome conservative Republicans have long expressed concerns over the reliability of aging U.S. warheads and believe that testing is a way to address this problem. Additionally, the U.S., Russia and China are producing novel types of nuclear missiles or other delivery systems and replacing existing nuclear weapons - some of which date to the Cold War - with updated ones. Some politicians in the U.S. are concerned about the reliability of these untested modern weapons as well.\n\nWe are two nuclear weapons researchers - a physicist and an arms control expert - and we believe that there is no value, from either the scientific nor diplomatic perspective, to be gained from resuming testing. In fact, all the evidence suggests that such a move would threaten U.S. national security.\n\nWhy did the US stop testing?\n\nSince the Trinity Test in July 1945, the U.S. has detonated 215 warheads above ground and 815 underground. These were done to test new weapon designs and also to ensure the reliability of older ones.\n\nWhen the Cold War ended, the U.S. pledged to stop doing such tests and a group within the United Nations began putting together the CTBT. The goal of the test ban treaty was to hinder new nations from developing nuclear arsenals and limit the capabilities of nations that already had them.\n\nSubcritical testing to maintain the arsenal\n\nAfter the U.S moratorium went into effect, the U.S. Department of Energy created a massive program called the Stockpile Stewardship Program to maintain the safety and reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons. Instead of crudely blowing up weapons to produce a nuclear explosion, scientists at facilities like U1A in Nevada began conducting what are called subcritical tests.\n\n[Expertise in your inbox. Sign up for The Conversation's newsletter and get expert takes on today's news, every day.]\n\nIn these tests, the plutonium that drives the nuclear chain reactions is replaced by a similar-acting but non-nuclear explosive material such as tungsten or a modified plutonium shell. There is still a big bang, but no nuclear chain reaction.\n\nRather, these experiments produce data that researchers feed into elaborate supercomputer programs built using the massive amounts of information collected from earlier live tests. Using these subcritical tests and earlier data, scientists can simulate full-scale detonations with incredible accuracy and monitor the current arsenal without blowing up nuclear warheads.\n\nWhat could be going wrong in the bombs?\n\nAll nuclear weapons currently in the U.S. stockpile are two-stage nuclear weapons called hydrogen bombs. Put simply, hydrogen bombs work by using a smaller nuclear bomb - akin to the bomb dropped on Nagasaki - to detonate a second, much more powerful bomb.\n\nNearly all the components of a nuclear weapon can be replaced and updated except for one piece - the explosive plutonium core known as the pit. These pits are what trigger the second, larger explosion.\n\nThe weapons in the U.S. arsenal are, on average, about 25 years old. The main concern of people pushing to resume testing is that the plutonium pits may have deteriorated from their own radiation in the time since they were made and will not properly trigger the second fusion stage of the explosion.\n\nSince most of the previous tests were done on much younger bombs with newer plutonium pits, supporters of testing claim that the subcritical tests cannot accurately test this part of the process.\n\nThe deterioration of the plutonium pit is a valid concern. To study this, researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory used a far more radioactive type of plutonium and artificially aged the metal to simulate the effects of what would be equivalent to 150 years of radiation on a normal plutonium pit. They found that the aged plutonium pits \"will retain their size, shape, and strength despite increasing damage from self-irradiation,\" and concluded that \"the pits will function as designed up to 150 years after they have been manufactured.\"\n\nThis isn't to say that scientists can stop worrying about the aging of U.S. nuclear weapons. It's important to continue \"to assess and, if necessary mitigate threats to primary performance caused by plutonium aging\", as the JASON group - a group of elite scientists that advises the U.S. government - says.\n\nHowever, these scientists do not suggest that it is necessary to conduct live nuclear tests. Decades of experimental studies by nuclear weapons laboratories have led experts to believe that the U.S. can maintain the nuclear arsenal without testing. And in fact, as the former director of Los Alamos National Labs, Dr. Sigfried Hecker said recently, many believe that by resuming testing, \"we would lose more than we gain.\"\n\nLittle to gain, much to lose\n\nNuclear weapons are intricately tied to the world of geopolitics. So if there isn't a scientific need to resume testing, is there some political or economic reason?\n\nThe U.S. has already spent tens of billions of dollars on the infrastructure needed to conduct subcritical tests. Additionally, a new, billion-dollar facility is currently being built in Nevada that will provide even finer detail to the data from subcritical test explosions. Once subcritical test facilities are up and running, it is relatively inexpensive to run experiments. Nuclear testing won't save the U.S. money.\n\nSo is it politics?\n\nCurrently, nuclear powers around the world are all improving the missiles that carry nuclear warheads, but not yet the warheads themselves.\n\nWith little evidence, the Trump administration has sought to sow suspicion that Russia and China may be secretly conducting very low-yield nuclear tests, implying that the countries are trying to build better nuclear warheads. In response, movement towards testing in the U.S. has already begun.\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee recently approved an amendment to spend US$10 million to cut the time it would take to conduct a test if the president ordered one. Some officials seem to believe that a resumption of U.S. testing - or the threat of it - could give Washington an upper hand in future arms control negotiations.\n\nBut we believe the opposite to be true. Even though the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty has not entered into force, nearly every nuclear power on earth has more or less followed its rules. But if the U.S. were to resume nuclear testing, it would be a green light for all other nations to start their own testing.\n\nThe U.S. already has the ability to perform subcritical tests and data from over 1,000 test detonations that scientists can use to modernize, improve and maintain the current arsenal. No other country, aside from Russia, has as robust a foundation. If the ban were broken, it would give other countries like Iran, India, Pakistan and China a chance to gather huge amounts of information and improve their weapons while the U.S. would gain next to nothing.\n\nWhen it comes to the U.S nuclear testing ban, our view is, if it ain't broke don't fix it.\n\nThis story was updated on August 3, 2020 to refer to the 75th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Pomper - Middlebury\n\n(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.)\n\nFerenc Dalnoki-Veress, Middlebury and Miles A. Pomper, Middlebury\n\n(THE CONVERSATION) More than seventy five years ago, on August 6, 1945, a U.S. plane dropped a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. This happened only a few short weeks after scientists in the U.S. conducted the world's first successful nuclear test. The Trinity Test, in New Mexico's Jornada del Muerto desert, proved that the design of the bomb worked and started the nuclear era.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But at the end of the Cold War in 1992, the U.S. government imposed a moratorium on U.S. testing. This was strengthened by the Clinton administration's decision to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Although the Senate never ratified the treaty and it never entered into force, all 184 countries that signed the test ban, including the U.S., have followed its rules.\n\nBut in recent weeks, the Trump administration and Congress have begun debating whether to restart active testing of nuclear weapons on U.S. soil.\n\nSome conservative Republicans have long expressed concerns over the reliability of aging U.S. warheads and believe that testing is a way to address this problem. Additionally, the U.S., Russia and China are producing novel types of nuclear missiles or other delivery systems and replacing existing nuclear weapons - some of which date to the Cold War - with updated ones. Some politicians in the U.S. are concerned about the reliability of these untested modern weapons as well.\n\nWe are two nuclear weapons researchers - a physicist and an arms control expert - and we believe that there is no value, from either the scientific nor diplomatic perspective, to be gained from resuming testing. In fact, all the evidence suggests that such a move would threaten U.S. national security.\n\nWhy did the US stop testing?\n\nSince the Trinity Test in July 1945, the U.S. has detonated 215 warheads above ground and 815 underground. These were done to test new weapon designs and also to ensure the reliability of older ones.\n\nWhen the Cold War ended, the U.S. pledged to stop doing such tests and a group within the United Nations began putting together the CTBT. The goal of the test ban treaty was to hinder new nations from developing nuclear arsenals and limit the capabilities of nations that already had them.\n\nSubcritical testing to maintain the arsenal\n\nAfter the U.S moratorium went into effect, the U.S. Department of Energy created a massive program called the Stockpile Stewardship Program to maintain the safety and reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons. Instead of crudely blowing up weapons to produce a nuclear explosion, scientists at facilities like U1A in Nevada began conducting what are called subcritical tests.\n\n[Expertise in your inbox. Sign up for The Conversation's newsletter and get expert takes on today's news, every day.]\n\nIn these tests, the plutonium that drives the nuclear chain reactions is replaced by a similar-acting but non-nuclear explosive material such as tungsten or a modified plutonium shell. There is still a big bang, but no nuclear chain reaction.\n\nRather, these experiments produce data that researchers feed into elaborate supercomputer programs built using the massive amounts of information collected from earlier live tests. Using these subcritical tests and earlier data, scientists can simulate full-scale detonations with incredible accuracy and monitor the current arsenal without blowing up nuclear warheads.\n\nWhat could be going wrong in the bombs?\n\nAll nuclear weapons currently in the U.S. stockpile are two-stage nuclear weapons called hydrogen bombs. Put simply, hydrogen bombs work by using a smaller nuclear bomb - akin to the bomb dropped on Nagasaki - to detonate a second, much more powerful bomb.\n\nNearly all the components of a nuclear weapon can be replaced and updated except for one piece - the explosive plutonium core known as the pit. These pits are what trigger the second, larger explosion.\n\nThe weapons in the U.S. arsenal are, on average, about 25 years old. The main concern of people pushing to resume testing is that the plutonium pits may have deteriorated from their own radiation in the time since they were made and will not properly trigger the second fusion stage of the explosion.\n\nSince most of the previous tests were done on much younger bombs with newer plutonium pits, supporters of testing claim that the subcritical tests cannot accurately test this part of the process.\n\nThe deterioration of the plutonium pit is a valid concern. To study this, researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory used a far more radioactive type of plutonium and artificially aged the metal to simulate the effects of what would be equivalent to 150 years of radiation on a normal plutonium pit. They found that the aged plutonium pits \"will retain their size, shape, and strength despite increasing damage from self-irradiation,\" and concluded that \"the pits will function as designed up to 150 years after they have been manufactured.\"\n\nThis isn't to say that scientists can stop worrying about the aging of U.S. nuclear weapons. It's important to continue \"to assess and, if necessary mitigate threats to primary performance caused by plutonium aging\", as the JASON group - a group of elite scientists that advises the U.S. government - says.\n\nHowever, these scientists do not suggest that it is necessary to conduct live nuclear tests. Decades of experimental studies by nuclear weapons laboratories have led experts to believe that the U.S. can maintain the nuclear arsenal without testing. And in fact, as the former director of Los Alamos National Labs, Dr. Sigfried Hecker said recently, many believe that by resuming testing, \"we would lose more than we gain.\"\n\nLittle to gain, much to lose\n\nNuclear weapons are intricately tied to the world of geopolitics. So if there isn't a scientific need to resume testing, is there some political or economic reason?\n\nThe U.S. has already spent tens of billions of dollars on the infrastructure needed to conduct subcritical tests. Additionally, a new, billion-dollar facility is currently being built in Nevada that will provide even finer detail to the data from subcritical test explosions. Once subcritical test facilities are up and running, it is relatively inexpensive to run experiments. Nuclear testing won't save the U.S. money.\n\nSo is it politics?\n\nCurrently, nuclear powers around the world are all improving the missiles that carry nuclear warheads, but not yet the warheads themselves.\n\nWith little evidence, the Trump administration has sought to sow suspicion that Russia and China may be secretly conducting very low-yield nuclear tests, implying that the countries are trying to build better nuclear warheads. In response, movement towards testing in the U.S. has already begun.\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee recently approved an amendment to spend US$10 million to cut the time it would take to conduct a test if the president ordered one. Some officials seem to believe that a resumption of U.S. testing - or the threat of it - could give Washington an upper hand in future arms control negotiations.\n\nBut we believe the opposite to be true. Even though the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty has not entered into force, nearly every nuclear power on earth has more or less followed its rules. But if the U.S. were to resume nuclear testing, it would be a green light for all other nations to start their own testing.\n\nThe U.S. already has the ability to perform subcritical tests and data from over 1,000 test detonations that scientists can use to modernize, improve and maintain the current arsenal. No other country, aside from Russia, has as robust a foundation. If the ban were broken, it would give other countries like Iran, India, Pakistan and China a chance to gather huge amounts of information and improve their weapons while the U.S. would gain next to nothing.\n\nWhen it comes to the U.S nuclear testing ban, our view is, if it ain't broke don't fix it.\n\nThis story was updated on August 3, 2020 to refer to the 75th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Such assurances given to NPT NNWS Parties against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons (negative security assurances), and of assistance to such States that are victims of aggression involving nuclear weapons or threatened with such aggression (positive security assurances), underscore the security benefits of adhering to and fully complying with the NPT and further the objective of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons while advancing the NPT's nuclear disarmament goals. In the context of Russia's repeated and flagrant disregard for its international obligations and commitments, including obligations under the United Nations Charter and commitments under the Budapest Memorandum, we reaffirm our NPT-related security assurances - both positive and negative.\n\nWe reaffirm in that regard, our existing national security assurances regarding the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against NNWS Parties to the NPT. We confirm that by ratifying relevant protocols to the treaties establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones, we have undertaken legally binding obligations to respect the status of such zones and not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against States Parties to such treaties.\n\nWe further recall our ratification or support for ratification of the relevant protocols to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, and the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia. We further note our readiness to engage with parties to the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in order to sign the revised protocol without delay.\n\nOur governments further reaffirm our national positive security assurances referenced in UNSCRs 255 (1968) and 984 (1995). We recognize the necessity of providing or supporting immediate assistance to any NNWS Party to the NPT that is an object of a threat of or act of aggression involving the use of nuclear weapons. We recall that UNSCR 984 also invited UN Member States to take appropriate measures in response to a request for technical, medical, scientific or humanitarian assistance from a non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the NPT that is a victim of an act of aggression with nuclear weapons. Forms of relevant assistance may include radiological emergency response, detection and assessment, and environmental mitigation as may be made available by UN Member States or relevant international organizations.\n\nWe are committed to continue working on such appropriate measures to safeguard the security of NPT NNWS Parties in compliance with their relevant nonproliferation obligations. We do so in consideration of our NPT undertakings and our enduring commitment to honor assurances given.\n\n-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "source": {"uri": "agenparl.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Agenparl"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 15, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 20, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7137594108", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-03", "time": "01:02:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-03T01:02:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-03T00:38:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4745098054409027, "url": "https://tass.com/world/1488433", "title": "Chinese diplomat says British, French stockpiles of nuclear weapons should be limited", "body": "All countries should reduce nuclear arms or keep arsenals at minimum levels necessary for national defense, the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Arms Control Department Director-General Fu Cong told said\n\nUNITED NATIONS, August 3. /TASS/.

More Soviet weapons then discovered their manner to Belarus and Kazakhstan.\n\nBy the mid-Nineteen Sixties, on the western facet of the Iron Curtain there have been three nuclear powers (the US, Britain and France), on the japanese facet, 4 ostensibily nuclear-armed states, although totally managed by the Kremlin.

They not are.\n\nIt is that this concern that's on the coronary heart of the Secretary-General's pessimism -- and ought to be on the coronary heart of all of us.", "source": {"uri": "pehalnews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pehal News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161108111029-fat-man-nuclear-bomb-large-169.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 11, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 15, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7140322424", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-05", "time": "02:19:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-05T02:19:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-05T01:24:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4666666686534882, "url": "https://consortiumnews.com/2022/08/04/is-nuclear-winter-coming/", "title": "Is Nuclear Winter Coming?", "body": "Six scientists, including Carl Sagan, who proved nuclear war would produce \"nuclear winter\" were at first dismissed by the establishment. On Saturday they will receive an award as the world is the closest to nuclear war since 1962.\n\nThis Saturday, on the 77th anniversary of the first use of a nuclear weapon in Hiroshima, on Aug. 6, 1945, six scientists who were scoffed at in 1983 for determining the earth would suffer from a \"nuclear winter\" in the event of nuclear war, will be presented with the Future of Life Award.\n\nThe Future of Life Institute will celebrate the scientists who discovered and spread the word about the shocking scientific prediction of nuclear winter: that firestorms set off by a major nuclear war would envelop the earth in soot and smoke blocking sunlight for years, sending global temperature plunging, ruining ecosystems and agriculture and killing billions through famine.\n\nThe awards will be presented at an event beginning at 7 p.m. Saturday at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, N.Y. (Information about attending free here). Consortium News will be covering the event.\n\nOne panel will discuss the most up-to-date findings about nuclear winter; the other will explore the challenges involved in communicating this risk to politicians and the public, from the 1980s to today. The specter of nuclear war still hangs over us, and current geopolitics has made it as threatening as ever.\n\nPanel 1 - The Science\n\nThe first conversation, moderated by physician-scientist and Future of Life Institute Director Dr. Emilia Javorsky, features nuclear winter pioneers Alan Robock, Brian Toon and Richard Turco. What have new cutting-edge climate models revealed about the climate impact in the aftermath of a nuclear war? What do new agricultural models predict about survival rates in various countries? And what about the impact of a nuclear war confined to one country or one continent?\n\nPanel 2 - The Communication\n\nThe second discussion, chaired by MIT professor and Future of Life Institute president Max Tegmark, will feature nuclear winter pioneers John Birks and Georgiy Stenchikov as well as Ann Druyan, the Award-winning American documentary producer and director who co-wrote Cosmos with her late husband Carl Sagan. This panel focuses on the fascinating story of how nuclear winter was initially discovered and communicated to the public, and how the science helped persuade Reagan and Gorbachev to back down from the nuclear brink, despite attempts to silence the discovery.\n\nAbout the Speakers\n\nJohn W. Birks is the co-founder and former president of 2B Technologies, where he now works as Chief Scientist, directing research and development into new miniaturized air pollution monitors. Birks is Professor Emeritus and Department Chair of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Fellow Emeritus of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He is best known for quantifying the rates of several chemical reactions key to understanding ozone depletion in the Antarctic ozone hole, and his seminal work in 1981-82 with Paul Crutzen (Nobel Laureate, 1995) in developing the theory of nuclear winter.\n\nAnn Druyan is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning writer, producer and director specializing in science communication. She was the Creative Director of NASA' s Voyager Record and co-wrote the 1980 television series Cosmos, with Carl Sagan, whom she married in 1981.\n\nAlan Robock is a Distinguished Professor of climate science in the Department of Environmental Sciences at Rutgers University. Robock has made significant contributions to our understanding of the environmental and humanitarian consequences of regional and global nuclear war. His areas of expertise include climate intervention (also called geoengineering), and the climatic effects of nuclear war and volcanic eruptions. Robock was a lead author of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He is now Associate Editor of Reviews of Geophysics, the most highly-cited journal in the Earth Sciences, a fellow of the American Geophysical Union, the American Meteorological Society (AMS), and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a recipient of the AMS Jule Charney Medal.\n\nGeorgiy Stenchikov completed his Ph.D. in the Numerical and Analytical Study of Weak Plasma Turbulence at Moscow Physical Technical Institute in 1977. Afterwards, he headed a department at the Russian Academy of Sciences, which used computational analysis to carry out crucial early research into the impact of humans on Earth's climate and environmental systems. In 1983, Stenchikov, along with his colleague Vladimir Alexandrov, used global climatic models to calculate the consequences of nuclear war. These efforts helped to support findings in the United States and influence political leadership in the Soviet Union to work on arms control. Since the end of the Cold War, Stenchikov has continued using climatic models to understand the consequences of nuclear war.\n\nOwen Brian Toon is a professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences, and a fellow at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. In 1969 he received an A.B. in physics at the University of California, Berkeley and, in 1975, a Ph.D. in physics at Cornell University under Carl Sagan. Toon focuses his research on cloud physics, atmospheric chemistry, radiative transfer, and comparing Earth with other planets. His work on the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs was pivotal to the discovery of nuclear winter; his contribution to the TTAPS paper involved applying his previous findings about the impact of volcanic dust clouds on the Martian climate. Toon is a fellow of the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union, from whom he received the Roger Revelle Medal in 2011.\n\nRichard Turco is an atmospheric scientist, and professor at the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, and the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles. He was lead author of the 'TTAPS' paper published in 1983 in Science magazine which coined the term 'nuclear winter' and popularized the idea. The paper reported computer simulations of strong climatic anomalies -- namely deep cooling of Earth's surface -- associated with the absorption of solar radiation by smoke generated in a putative large-scale nuclear exchange. Turco was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 1986.\n\nAbout the Hosts\n\nEmilia Javorsky is a physician-scientist, entrepreneur, and advocate for the safe and beneficial use of emerging technologies. Dr. Javorsky is a director at the Future of Life Institute, a visiting scholar and mentor at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard Medical School, a Global Shaper of the World Economic Forum and a Forbes 30 Under 30 in Healthcare. She has authored a multitude of peer-reviewed publications and is an inventor on multiple patents.\n\nMax Tegmark is a professor doing AI and physics research at MIT as part of the Institute for Artificial Intelligence & Fundamental Interactions and the Center for Brains, Minds and Machines. He advocates for positive use of technology as president of the Future of Life Institute.

But international developments, including nuclear threats from Russia in the war in Ukraine, have brought a broader awareness of the vulnerability to global peace from nuclear events.\n\nPeople are also reading...

This has included my direct involvement in research, teaching and humanitarian efforts in multiple expeditions to Chernobyl- and Fukushima-contaminated areas. Now I am involved in the proposal for the formation of a Nuclear Global Health Workforce, which I proposed in 2017.\n\nSuch a group could bring together nuclear and nonnuclear technical and health professionals for education and training, and help to meet the preparedness, coordination, collaboration and staffing requirements necessary to respond to a large-scale nuclear crisis.\n\nWhat would this workforce need to be prepared to manage? For that we can look back at the legacy of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as nuclear accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima.\n\nWhat happens when a nuclear device is detonated over a city?\n\nApproximately 135,000 and 64,000 people died, respectively, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The great majority of deaths happened in the first days after the bombings, mainly from thermal burns, severe physical injuries and radiation.\n\nThe great majority of doctors and nurses in Hiroshima were killed and injured, and therefore unable to assist in the response. This was largely due to the concentration of medical personnel and facilities in inner urban areas. This exact concentration exists today in the majority of American cities, and is a chilling reminder of the difficulty in medically responding to nuclear events.\n\nWhat if a nuclear device were detonated in an urban area today? I explored this issue in a 2007 study modeling a nuclear weapon attack on four American cities. As in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the majority of deaths would happen soon after the detonation, and the local health care response capability would be largely eradicated.\n\nModels show that such an event in an urban area in particular will not only destroy the existing public health protections but will, most likely, make it extremely difficult to respond, recover and rehabilitate them.\n\nVery few medical personnel today have the skills or knowledge to treat the kind and the quantity of injuries a nuclear blast can cause. Health care workers would have little to no familiarity with the treatment of radiation victims. Thermal burns would require enormous resources to treat even a single patient, and a large number of patients with these injuries will overwhelm any existing medical system. There would also be a massive number of laceration injuries from the breakage of virtually all glass in a wide area.\n\nGetting people out of the blast and radiation contamination zones\n\nA major nuclear event would create widespread panic, as large populations would fear the spread of radioactive materials, so evacuation or sheltering in place must be considered.\n\nFor instance, within a few weeks after the Chernobyl accident, more than 116,000 people were evacuated from the most contaminated areas of Ukraine and Belarus. Another 220,000 people were relocated in subsequent years.\n\nThe day after the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami, over 200,000 people were evacuated from areas within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the nuclear plant because of the fear of the potential for radiation exposure.\n\nThe evacuation process in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Japan was plagued by misinformation, inadequate and confusing orders and delays in releasing information. There was also trouble evacuating everyone from the affected areas. Elderly and infirm residents were left in areas near radioactive contamination, and many others moved unnecessarily from uncontaminated areas (resulting in many deaths from winter conditions). All of these troubles lead to a loss of public trust in the government.\n\nHowever, an encouraging fact about nuclear fallout (and not generally known) is that the actual area that will receive dangerous levels of radioactive fallout is actually only a fraction of the total area in a circle around the detonation zone. For instance, in a hypothetical low-yield (10 kiloton) nuclear bomb over Washington, D.C., only limited evacuations are planned. Despite projections of 100,000 fatalities and about 150,000 casualties, the casualty-producing radiation plume would actually be expected to be confined to a relatively small area. (Using a clock-face analogy, the danger area would typically take up only a two-hour slot on the circle around the detonation, dictated by wind: for example, 2-4 o'clock.)\n\nPeople upwind would not need to take any action, and most of those downwind, in areas receiving relatively small radiation levels (from the point of view of being sufficient to cause radiation-related health issues), would need to seek only \"moderate shelter.\" That means basically staying indoors for a day or so or until emergency authorities give further instructions.\n\nThe long-term effects of radiation exposure\n\nThe Radiation Effects Research Foundation, which was established to study the effects of radiation on survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, has been tracking the health effects of radiation for decades.\n\nAccording to the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, about 1,900 excess cancer deaths can be attributed to the atomic bombs, with about 200 cases of leukemia and 1,700 solid cancers. Japan has constructed very detailed cancer screenings after Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Fukushima.\n\nBut the data on many potential health effects from radiation exposure, such as birth defects, are actually quite different from the prevailing public perception, which has been derived not from validated science education but from entertainment outlets (I teach a university course on the impact of media and popular culture on disaster knowledge).\n\nWhile it has been shown that intense medical X-ray exposure has accidentally produced birth defects in humans, there is doubt about whether there were birth defects in the descendants of Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors. Most respected long-term investigations have concluded there are no statistically significant increases in birth defects resulting in atomic bomb survivors.\n\nLooking at data from Chernobyl, where the release of airborne radiation was 100 times as much as Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined, there is a lack of definitive data for radiation-induced birth defects.\n\nA wide-ranging WHO study concluded that there were no differences in rates of mental retardation and emotional problems in Chernobyl radiation-exposed children compared to children in control groups. A Harvard review on Chernobyl concluded that there was no substantive proof regarding radiation-induced effects on embryos or fetuses from the accident. Another study looked at the congenital abnormality registers for 16 European regions that received fallout from Chernobyl and concluded that the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of radiation exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified.\n\nIndeed, the most definitive Chernobyl health impact in terms of numbers was the dramatic increase of elective abortions near and at significant distances from the accident site.\n\nIn addition to rapid response and evacuation plans, a Nuclear Global Health Workforce could help health care practitioners, policymakers, administrators and others understand myths and realities of radiation. In the critical time just after a nuclear crisis, this would help officials make evidence-based policy decisions and help people understand the actual risks they face.\n\nWhat's the risk of another Hiroshima or Nagasaki?\n\nToday, the risk of a nuclear exchange - and its devastating impact on medicine and public health worldwide - has only escalated compared to previous decades. Nine countries are known to have nuclear weapons, and international relations are increasingly volatile. The U.S. and Russia are heavily investing in the modernization of their nuclear stockpiles, and China, India and Pakistan are rapidly expanding the size and sophistication of their nuclear weapon capabilities. The developing technological sophistication among terrorist groups and the growing global availability and distribution of radioactive materials are also especially worrying.\n\n[Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation's newsletter.]\n\nIn recent years, a number of government and private organizations have held meetings (all of which I attended) to devise large-scale medical responses to a nuclear weapon detonation in the U.S. and worldwide. They include the National Academy of Sciences, the National Alliance for Radiation Readiness, National Disaster Life Support Foundation, Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, and the Radiation Injury Treatment Network, which includes 74 hospitals nationwide actively preparing to receive radiation-exposed patients.\n\nDespite the gloomy prospects of health outcomes of any large-scale nuclear event common in the minds of many, there are a number of concrete steps the U.S. and other countries can take to prepare.

Pomper, Middlebury\n\n(THE CONVERSATION) More than seventy five years ago, on August 6, 1945, a U.S. plane dropped a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. This happened only a few short weeks after scientists in the U.S. conducted the world's first successful nuclear test. The Trinity Test, in New Mexico's Jornada del Muerto desert, proved that the design of the bomb worked and started the nuclear era.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But at the end of the Cold War in 1992, the U.S. government imposed a moratorium on U.S. testing. This was strengthened by the Clinton administration's decision to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Although the Senate never ratified the treaty and it never entered into force, all 184 countries that signed the test ban, including the U.S., have followed its rules.\n\nBut in recent weeks, the Trump administration and Congress have begun debating whether to restart active testing of nuclear weapons on U.S. soil.\n\nSome conservative Republicans have long expressed concerns over the reliability of aging U.S. warheads and believe that testing is a way to address this problem. Additionally, the U.S., Russia and China are producing novel types of nuclear missiles or other delivery systems and replacing existing nuclear weapons - some of which date to the Cold War - with updated ones. Some politicians in the U.S. are concerned about the reliability of these untested modern weapons as well.\n\nWe are two nuclear weapons researchers - a physicist and an arms control expert - and we believe that there is no value, from either the scientific nor diplomatic perspective, to be gained from resuming testing. In fact, all the evidence suggests that such a move would threaten U.S. national security.\n\nWhy did the US stop testing?\n\nSince the Trinity Test in July 1945, the U.S. has detonated 215 warheads above ground and 815 underground. These were done to test new weapon designs and also to ensure the reliability of older ones.\n\nWhen the Cold War ended, the U.S. pledged to stop doing such tests and a group within the United Nations began putting together the CTBT. The goal of the test ban treaty was to hinder new nations from developing nuclear arsenals and limit the capabilities of nations that already had them.\n\nSubcritical testing to maintain the arsenal\n\nAfter the U.S moratorium went into effect, the U.S. Department of Energy created a massive program called the Stockpile Stewardship Program to maintain the safety and reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons. Instead of crudely blowing up weapons to produce a nuclear explosion, scientists at facilities like U1A in Nevada began conducting what are called subcritical tests.\n\n[Expertise in your inbox. Sign up for The Conversation's newsletter and get expert takes on today's news, every day.]\n\nIn these tests, the plutonium that drives the nuclear chain reactions is replaced by a similar-acting but non-nuclear explosive material such as tungsten or a modified plutonium shell. There is still a big bang, but no nuclear chain reaction.\n\nRather, these experiments produce data that researchers feed into elaborate supercomputer programs built using the massive amounts of information collected from earlier live tests. Using these subcritical tests and earlier data, scientists can simulate full-scale detonations with incredible accuracy and monitor the current arsenal without blowing up nuclear warheads.\n\nWhat could be going wrong in the bombs?\n\nAll nuclear weapons currently in the U.S. stockpile are two-stage nuclear weapons called hydrogen bombs. Put simply, hydrogen bombs work by using a smaller nuclear bomb - akin to the bomb dropped on Nagasaki - to detonate a second, much more powerful bomb.\n\nNearly all the components of a nuclear weapon can be replaced and updated except for one piece - the explosive plutonium core known as the pit. These pits are what trigger the second, larger explosion.\n\nThe weapons in the U.S. arsenal are, on average, about 25 years old. The main concern of people pushing to resume testing is that the plutonium pits may have deteriorated from their own radiation in the time since they were made and will not properly trigger the second fusion stage of the explosion.\n\nSince most of the previous tests were done on much younger bombs with newer plutonium pits, supporters of testing claim that the subcritical tests cannot accurately test this part of the process.\n\nThe deterioration of the plutonium pit is a valid concern. To study this, researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory used a far more radioactive type of plutonium and artificially aged the metal to simulate the effects of what would be equivalent to 150 years of radiation on a normal plutonium pit. They found that the aged plutonium pits \"will retain their size, shape, and strength despite increasing damage from self-irradiation,\" and concluded that \"the pits will function as designed up to 150 years after they have been manufactured.\"\n\nThis isn't to say that scientists can stop worrying about the aging of U.S. nuclear weapons. It's important to continue \"to assess and, if necessary mitigate threats to primary performance caused by plutonium aging\", as the JASON group - a group of elite scientists that advises the U.S. government - says.\n\nHowever, these scientists do not suggest that it is necessary to conduct live nuclear tests. Decades of experimental studies by nuclear weapons laboratories have led experts to believe that the U.S. can maintain the nuclear arsenal without testing. And in fact, as the former director of Los Alamos National Labs, Dr. Sigfried Hecker said recently, many believe that by resuming testing, \"we would lose more than we gain.\"\n\nLittle to gain, much to lose\n\nNuclear weapons are intricately tied to the world of geopolitics. So if there isn't a scientific need to resume testing, is there some political or economic reason?\n\nThe U.S. has already spent tens of billions of dollars on the infrastructure needed to conduct subcritical tests. Additionally, a new, billion-dollar facility is currently being built in Nevada that will provide even finer detail to the data from subcritical test explosions. Once subcritical test facilities are up and running, it is relatively inexpensive to run experiments. Nuclear testing won't save the U.S. money.\n\nSo is it politics?\n\nCurrently, nuclear powers around the world are all improving the missiles that carry nuclear warheads, but not yet the warheads themselves.\n\nWith little evidence, the Trump administration has sought to sow suspicion that Russia and China may be secretly conducting very low-yield nuclear tests, implying that the countries are trying to build better nuclear warheads. In response, movement towards testing in the U.S. has already begun.\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee recently approved an amendment to spend US$10 million to cut the time it would take to conduct a test if the president ordered one. Some officials seem to believe that a resumption of U.S. testing - or the threat of it - could give Washington an upper hand in future arms control negotiations.\n\nBut we believe the opposite to be true. Even though the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty has not entered into force, nearly every nuclear power on earth has more or less followed its rules. But if the U.S. were to resume nuclear testing, it would be a green light for all other nations to start their own testing.\n\nThe U.S. already has the ability to perform subcritical tests and data from over 1,000 test detonations that scientists can use to modernize, improve and maintain the current arsenal. No other country, aside from Russia, has as robust a foundation. If the ban were broken, it would give other countries like Iran, India, Pakistan and China a chance to gather huge amounts of information and improve their weapons while the U.S. would gain next to nothing.\n\nWhen it comes to the U.S nuclear testing ban, our view is, if it ain't broke don't fix it.\n\nThis story was updated on August 3, 2020 to refer to the 75th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

This has included my direct involvement in research, teaching and humanitarian efforts in multiple expeditions to Chernobyl- and Fukushima-contaminated areas. Now I am involved in the proposal for the formation of a Nuclear Global Health Workforce, which I proposed in 2017.\n\nSuch a group could bring together nuclear and nonnuclear technical and health professionals for education and training, and help to meet the preparedness, coordination, collaboration and staffing requirements necessary to respond to a large-scale nuclear crisis.\n\nWhat would this workforce need to be prepared to manage? For that we can look back at the legacy of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as nuclear accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima.\n\nWhat happens when a nuclear device is detonated over a city?\n\nApproximately 135,000 and 64,000 people died, respectively, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The great majority of deaths happened in the first days after the bombings, mainly from thermal burns, severe physical injuries and radiation.\n\nThe great majority of doctors and nurses in Hiroshima were killed and injured, and therefore unable to assist in the response. This was largely due to the concentration of medical personnel and facilities in inner urban areas. This exact concentration exists today in the majority of American cities, and is a chilling reminder of the difficulty in medically responding to nuclear events.\n\nWhat if a nuclear device were detonated in an urban area today? I explored this issue in a 2007 study modeling a nuclear weapon attack on four American cities. As in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the majority of deaths would happen soon after the detonation, and the local health care response capability would be largely eradicated.\n\nModels show that such an event in an urban area in particular will not only destroy the existing public health protections but will, most likely, make it extremely difficult to respond, recover and rehabilitate them.\n\nVery few medical personnel today have the skills or knowledge to treat the kind and the quantity of injuries a nuclear blast can cause. Health care workers would have little to no familiarity with the treatment of radiation victims. Thermal burns would require enormous resources to treat even a single patient, and a large number of patients with these injuries will overwhelm any existing medical system. There would also be a massive number of laceration injuries from the breakage of virtually all glass in a wide area.\n\nGetting people out of the blast and radiation contamination zones\n\nA major nuclear event would create widespread panic, as large populations would fear the spread of radioactive materials, so evacuation or sheltering in place must be considered.\n\nFor instance, within a few weeks after the Chernobyl accident, more than 116,000 people were evacuated from the most contaminated areas of Ukraine and Belarus. Another 220,000 people were relocated in subsequent years.\n\nThe day after the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami, over 200,000 people were evacuated from areas within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the nuclear plant because of the fear of the potential for radiation exposure.\n\nThe evacuation process in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Japan was plagued by misinformation, inadequate and confusing orders and delays in releasing information. There was also trouble evacuating everyone from the affected areas. Elderly and infirm residents were left in areas near radioactive contamination, and many others moved unnecessarily from uncontaminated areas (resulting in many deaths from winter conditions). All of these troubles lead to a loss of public trust in the government.\n\nHowever, an encouraging fact about nuclear fallout (and not generally known) is that the actual area that will receive dangerous levels of radioactive fallout is actually only a fraction of the total area in a circle around the detonation zone. For instance, in a hypothetical low-yield (10 kiloton) nuclear bomb over Washington, D.C., only limited evacuations are planned. Despite projections of 100,000 fatalities and about 150,000 casualties, the casualty-producing radiation plume would actually be expected to be confined to a relatively small area. (Using a clock-face analogy, the danger area would typically take up only a two-hour slot on the circle around the detonation, dictated by wind: for example, 2-4 o'clock.)\n\nPeople upwind would not need to take any action, and most of those downwind, in areas receiving relatively small radiation levels (from the point of view of being sufficient to cause radiation-related health issues), would need to seek only \"moderate shelter.\" That means basically staying indoors for a day or so or until emergency authorities give further instructions.\n\nThe long-term effects of radiation exposure\n\nThe Radiation Effects Research Foundation, which was established to study the effects of radiation on survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, has been tracking the health effects of radiation for decades.\n\nAccording to the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, about 1,900 excess cancer deaths can be attributed to the atomic bombs, with about 200 cases of leukemia and 1,700 solid cancers. Japan has constructed very detailed cancer screenings after Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Fukushima.\n\nBut the data on many potential health effects from radiation exposure, such as birth defects, are actually quite different from the prevailing public perception, which has been derived not from validated science education but from entertainment outlets (I teach a university course on the impact of media and popular culture on disaster knowledge).\n\nWhile it has been shown that intense medical X-ray exposure has accidentally produced birth defects in humans, there is doubt about whether there were birth defects in the descendants of Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors. Most respected long-term investigations have concluded there are no statistically significant increases in birth defects resulting in atomic bomb survivors.\n\nLooking at data from Chernobyl, where the release of airborne radiation was 100 times as much as Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined, there is a lack of definitive data for radiation-induced birth defects.\n\nA wide-ranging WHO study concluded that there were no differences in rates of mental retardation and emotional problems in Chernobyl radiation-exposed children compared to children in control groups. A Harvard review on Chernobyl concluded that there was no substantive proof regarding radiation-induced effects on embryos or fetuses from the accident. Another study looked at the congenital abnormality registers for 16 European regions that received fallout from Chernobyl and concluded that the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of radiation exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified.\n\nIndeed, the most definitive Chernobyl health impact in terms of numbers was the dramatic increase of elective abortions near and at significant distances from the accident site.\n\nIn addition to rapid response and evacuation plans, a Nuclear Global Health Workforce could help health care practitioners, policymakers, administrators and others understand myths and realities of radiation. In the critical time just after a nuclear crisis, this would help officials make evidence-based policy decisions and help people understand the actual risks they face.\n\nWhat's the risk of another Hiroshima or Nagasaki?\n\nToday, the risk of a nuclear exchange - and its devastating impact on medicine and public health worldwide - has only escalated compared to previous decades. Nine countries are known to have nuclear weapons, and international relations are increasingly volatile. The U.S. and Russia are heavily investing in the modernization of their nuclear stockpiles, and China, India and Pakistan are rapidly expanding the size and sophistication of their nuclear weapon capabilities. The developing technological sophistication among terrorist groups and the growing global availability and distribution of radioactive materials are also especially worrying.\n\n[Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation's newsletter.]\n\nIn recent years, a number of government and private organizations have held meetings (all of which I attended) to devise large-scale medical responses to a nuclear weapon detonation in the U.S. and worldwide. They include the National Academy of Sciences, the National Alliance for Radiation Readiness, National Disaster Life Support Foundation, Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, and the Radiation Injury Treatment Network, which includes 74 hospitals nationwide actively preparing to receive radiation-exposed patients.\n\nDespite the gloomy prospects of health outcomes of any large-scale nuclear event common in the minds of many, there are a number of concrete steps the U.S. and other countries can take to prepare.

all nuclear weapons states to essentially pledge to provide safeguards to non-nuclear-weapon states parties to the treaty to refrain from using nuclear weapons or threaten to use them against the states.\n\nHE Permanent Representative of the State of Qatar emphasized the significance of enhancing NPT's regime to ensure that peaceful uses of nuclear energy are not diverted to other purposes to make sure that IAEA's safeguards system, which is essentially formulated with the additional protocol, constitutes the cornerstone of verification of nuclear non-proliferation regime to achieve the treaty's goals, pointing out that IAEA is the international agency which is solely entrusted to conduct verification that requires all kinds of support from the entire states to further undertake that role.\n\nHE Sheikha Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani underscored that the international verification regime will remain deficient unless it is accompanied by concerted efforts to halt the nuclear arms race, in addition to reducing nuclear stockpiles, and ultimately attain nuclear disarmament, stressing the importance of exerting the assiduous efforts for the sake of achieving the treaty's universality, calling for the necessary accession of non-nuclear states parties to the treaty as nonnuclear states.\n\nHer Excellency stressed that the entitlement for the peaceful use of atomic energy is an inalienable right of the states which remains an integral part of their rights in development and is considered one of the three pillars of the treaty, expressing her appreciation and gratitude for IAEA for enhancing and expanding the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health, and prosperity in the entire world, calling for fostering IAEA's role in supporting the peaceful uses of atomic energy, particularly the technical cooperation program which is deemed the key tool of IAEA to transfer nuclear technology to the member states for peaceful uses.\n\nShe also urged advanced states in the nuclear industry to provide scientific and technical assistance to the developing countries which need greater support, including expanded international cooperation.\n\nIn the statement of the State of Qatar, HE Permanent Representative of the State of Qatar to the UN also tackled the decision of the 1995 Review Conference concerning the middle east, where she stressed that it is an integral part of infinite treaty extension deal, and will remain valid pending accomplishment of its goals.\n\nShe added that there is the collective responsibility of establishing the region imposed by documents and international resolutions, including UN Security Council's Resolutions No. 487 of 1981 and 687 of 1991, emphasizing that the persistent absence of progress toward establishing the region has grave consequences that might potentially threaten regional and international peace and security, indicating that the review conference called for rectifying the track and take further effective steps to achieve progress in establishing the region.\n\nHer Excellency called on all treaty member states to reach an essential consensus in order for the conference to come out with a final document that advances the joint action towards the full accomplishment of the NPT objectives.", "source": {"uri": "thepeninsulaqatar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peninsula"},

"body": "Bangladesh Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen has urged the international community to unite against the perpetual holding of nuclear weapons by a handful of states in total disregard of the safety and security of humanity.\n\nHe was speaking at the 10th Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference held at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Hall in the UN Headquarters on Monday.\n\nReferring to the clarion call to emancipate the world from the scourge of nuclear war, made by the Father of the Nation of Bangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in his historic maiden speech at the UN General Assembly in 1974, Momen said, \"That forms the cornerstone of Bangladesh's total and unwavering commitment to general and complete disarmament of nuclear weapons which is also a constitutional obligation of Bangladesh.\"\n\nHe reiterated Bangladesh's support to the effective implementation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) through its three pillars -- nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, said the Bangladesh Permanent Mission to UN in New York.\n\nIn this regard, he put emphasis on the non-discriminatory implementation of Article IV of the Treaty, which recognises the inalienable rights of all States to develop, research, produce, and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, including in power generation, healthcare and agriculture.\n\nThe Bangladesh Foreign Minister called for increased investment and international cooperation in the research of nuclear technology and exploring the potentials of its peaceful use for the benefit of human kind.\n\nMentioning the expenditure of 82.4 billion US dollars in 2021 to upkeep nuclear weapons amid the pandemic, he urged the States to stop senseless investments in destructive nuclear weapons and instead re-direct these resources to promote health, address climate change, achieve the SDGs, and promote peace and stability.\n\nMeeting with UN Secretary-General\n\nOn the sidelines of the NPT Review Conference, Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen held a bilateral meeting with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nA range of UN and international issues, including UN peacekeeping operations, climate change, and the Rohingya issue, were discussed in the meeting.\n\nDuring the discussion on peacekeeping operations, the UN Secretary-General applauded Bangladesh's significant contribution to UN peacekeeping operations.\n\nIn response to the Foreign Minister's request for recruiting more Bangladeshi peacekeepers, the UN Secretary-General said that more peacekeepers, weapons, and ammunition would soon be taken from Bangladesh for various peacekeeping missions in Africa.\n\nBesides, the Foreign Minister requested the Secretary-General to appoint more Bangladeshi officials to different political and military positions at the United Nations Headquarters.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General conveyed the gratitude of the international community to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for providing shelter to the displaced Rohingya and for offering continued humanitarian assistance to them.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General also expressed his gratitude to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for agreeing to join the Global Crisis Response Group to deal with the challenges of conflict in Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to the UN Secretary-General, Foreign Minister Momen held bilateral meetings with the leaders of various countries attending the NPT conference.\n\nAmong them are Slovenia's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ms.Tanja Fajon, Hungary's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Peter Szijiarto, and Argentina's Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Santiago Cafiero.

It's a measure of the strangeness of political \"face\" (we denigrate the Chinese preoccupation with \"face,\" as if our \"credibility\" did not amount to exactly the same thing) when the diplomatic visit of a lone government official can become the kind of spark that the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand played in setting off WW1. But almost any inadvertency could start WW3, because deterrence, to \"work\" (until it doesn't \"work\" that is) requires hair-trigger preparedness.\n\nIt's an outrage, it's evil, it's incredibly stupid, and it ought to be illegal under international law. Oh, wait a minute, it is illegal under international law. See the Kellogg-Briand pact against war, in force since 1929; the treaty on Nuclear Weapons Proliferation (NPT), in force since 1971; and also the United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) in the process of being ratified by a majority of the world's nations and having the force of international law applicable to all since 22 January 2021.\n\nDemocratic nuclear powers rationalize their weapons as good because their governments are representative, but in reality, world-ending weapons are all world-ending, not \"good\" nuclear weapons because they are in the hands of good people or \"bad\" nuclear weapons because they are in the hands of totalitarian dictators. The catastrophe resulting from escalating into even a limited nuclear war would render such a distinction meaningless.\n\nNobody, including both the non-democracies and the democracies, wants war. Meanwhile the deterrence system remains a holocaust waiting to happen that would dwarf the Nazi Holocaust. Nuclear policy consists of mulish refusal of nuclear nations to come together in their own self-interest and move beyond obsolete, unworkable games of chicken. All these smart people interested in wielding power seem blind to the reality that it is perfectly feasible technologically to verifiably, reciprocally reduce nuclear weapons to zero, thereby raising humankind's chances of survival considerably.\n\nThe merciless and pointless invasion of Ukraine and the equally pointless war China threatens to make on Taiwan (or the second Gulf war for that matter) indicate a profound sickness in power dynamics -- the failure to act upon the truth that we are all in this together on one small planet, and we either are going to destroy everything or learn to get along and save everything. The cries of the hungry and displaced are not cries for trillions of dollars to be spent in endless arms renewal.\n\nPresident Biden is a good, decent public servant, but he presides over what Elaine Scarry calls a thermonuclear monarchy, identical to the nuclear monarchies of oligarch-dictators like Putin and Xi Jinping.\n\nWhere is citizen mobilization around a larger vision of self-interest that would yield servant leadership at the top? Limitless egocentricity insists that the whole nuclear system continue merely for a few men to preserve their power. In the U.S. this egocentricity manifests of course in the phenomenon of Trump, who identifies with dictators and wouldn't mind being one.\n\nThe misunderstanding of power dynamics on the part of these leaders, the utter failure to see past the short-term to the actual state of the Earth at this moment in the great unfolding story of the human experiment, is breathtaking.\n\nMulishness, even if it is an insult to mules, may be the word to describe this complete misunderstanding, this narrowness of focus on remaining in power at all costs, including the casual willingness to use even nuclear threats in defense of that power. When leaders try to maintain a deterrent system which can fail at any moment for the flimsiest of reasons, the far, far greater power of nuclear weapons is going to inevitably come back to bite us all in our collective butts with its poisonous fangs.\n\nWhen it comes to the environment, the reality of our oneness as a species has begun to penetrate, but not nearly far enough into the collective soul to make the necessary difference. The ecophilosopher Thomas Berry asserts that this moment on the planet, the radical degradation of our oceans, our air, our soil, along with the rapid extinction of thousands of species of birds and insects and other forms of life, represents the end of the 65 million year period of the Cenozoic, which began with the demise of the dinosaurs.\n\nOur energy as a species must now be focused upon bringing the whole Earth community together into a new moment of creative collaboration, which Berry has called the Ecozoic. That task far transcends the obsolete power dynamics, based in fear, hate and helplessness, that energizes not only the leaders of too many nations but too many of their followers as well.\n\nUltimately nuclear weapons and environmental disaster represent an identical misunderstanding of our interdependence with each other and the biosystem.\n\nWe are, as Berry says, at the end of an old, unworkable story. The new story, whatever form it may take, involves the harnessing of our creative energies in the context of forces infinitely larger and more mysterious than the political ego.\n\nAs one example of what might encourage us to move safely into the future, we need look no further than the Webb telescope -- to the cooperative spirit displayed by scientists from 14 nations who realized the project. Even more importantly, let us look to the vision the Webb reveals of our place among hundreds of billions of galaxies. We humans are an integral part of 13.85 billion years of creativity. We are the universe looking at itself in wonder. That wonder has the potential to dissolve our obstinate mulishness, re-energizing our politics, our economics, our religious convictions, and our understanding of self-interest.", "source": {"uri": "counterpunch.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Counter Punch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "winslow_myers@counterpunch.org", "name": "Winslow Myers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cp-default-share.png", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 19, "stanza_pos": 5, "swn_neg": 34, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7135769286", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-01", "time": "14:42:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-01T14:42:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-01T14:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4392156898975372, "url": "https://www.nampa.org/index.php?model=categories&function=display&id=21945221", "title": "\n\tAFP - UN-diplomacy-nuclear", "body": "URGENT UN chief warns humanity 'one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation'\n\nUnited Nations, United States, Aug 1, 2022 (AFP) - UN head Antonio Guterres warned Monday that humanity was \"just one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,\" with the world facing a threat \"not seen since the height of the Cold War.\"\n\n\"We have been extraordinarily lucky so far.

However, recent chemical weapons use in Iraq, Malaysia, the Russian Federation, Syria and the United Kingdom, as well as the threat of their use in the war in Ukraine, are cause for growing concern. \"In managing these challenges, effective national implementation of international obligations is our first line of defence,\" he emphasized.\n\nWendin D. Smith, Acting Assistant Secretary General of the Political Affairs and Security Policy Division of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), pointed out that after the cold war, allied countries \"dramatically\" reduced the number of nuclear weapons stationed in Europe and took steps to ensure NATO's nuclear deterrent capabilities remain safe, secure and effective. Notwithstanding the Russian Federation's actions that undermine the Non-Proliferation Treaty, she said the purpose of NATO's nuclear capability has always been to preserve peace, prevent coercion and deter aggression. Allies have always adhered to their Treaty obligations and will continue to do so, she said, while nuclear sharing arrangements remain consistent with the accord.\n\nHighlighting a bilateral initiative in Latin America, a representative of the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials, said the Agreement between Argentina and Brazil for the Exclusively Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy established a common system of control applied to all nuclear materials and facilities -- an innovative arrangement that exists nowhere else today. The agency cooperates with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to improve the coordination of safeguards activities, as well as with Government entities and technical associations outside the region.\n\nRepresentatives of regional organizations highlighted the importance of nuclear-weapon-free zones in ensuring regional and international peace and security, while underscoring areas for urgent action.\n\nThe Permanent Observer for the League of Arab States noted that all Arab States have joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty -- motivated by the promise of increased security. Israel is the only country in the Middle East that remains outside the Treaty, he said, adding that the lack of progress in establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region has led to \"deep negative effects\". For the Review Conference to be considered a success, its outcome document must address the need for greater efforts to establish such a zone and for Israel to accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear State.\n\nA speaker for the African Commission on Nuclear Energy -- as well as African States parties to the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (the Pelindaba Treaty) -- said the Commission is enhancing coordination with the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Central Asian Nuclear-Weapons-Free Zone and it plans similar engagement with other regional zones. Noting that the nuclear-weapon-free zones in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, South Pacific, Southeast Asia and Central Asia, and the zone in Mongolia comprise 114 States and almost 40 per cent of the world's population, he called on the five nuclear-weapon States to prioritize ratification of all applicable protocols within current nuclear-weapon-free-zone treaties.\n\nMember States also took the floor, echoing calls heard on prior days' deliberations for nuclear-weapon States to renew their commitments on disarmament, while highlighting the benefits of cooperation, including in the establishment of zones free of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe representative of Botswana said the IAEA has facilitated his country's access to nuclear technology to prevent and control livestock diseases and crop production. Botswana has also received capacity-building support from the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004), and the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs in collaboration with the United States, the European Union and other partners.\n\nThe speaker for Peru said that, as a party to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco), his country has witnessed the benefits of nuclear-weapon-free zones, especially in enhancing regional security and promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and technology. Voicing concern over expanded nuclear alliances that undermine commitments under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, he said the international community must strengthen cooperation among the different nuclear-weapon-free zones.\n\nAlso speaking were representatives of Canada (on behalf of a group of States on gender), Equatorial Guinea and Myanmar.\n\nRepresentatives of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the International Committee of the Red Cross also delivered statements.\n\nThe representatives of Germany, United States, Iran and China spoke in exercise of the right of reply.\n\nThe Tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will reconvene at 3 p.m. on Friday, 5 August.\n\nStatements\n\nLESLIE NORTON (Canada), speaking on behalf of a group of States on gender, noted that Action 36 of the Secretary-General's Agenda for Disarmament makes clear that the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in representation, advocacy and decision-making processes is key to moving towards a safer future. She affirmed that gender perspectives provide key insights into how individuals and groups are differentially impacted by armed conflict and weapons. The intersections of race, gender, economic status, geography, nationality, and other factors must be taken into account, as nuclear weapons have different effects on different demographics -- as evidenced in studies with survivors of weapons use and testing. It is further important to identify gaps and barriers in existing regimes and forums. She noted that this review cycle has seen some improvements in the number of women participants, which should be recognized.\n\nShe further welcomed an increased focus in ensuring that youth and other historically excluded voices are heard, including through the #Youth4Disarmament initiative. As the generation that will have to live with the consequences of success or failure on the issue, she stressed that youth have a very real stake in the work of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons -- also bringing fresh and creative ideas to the fore. Gender can affect exposure to nuclear risk, she noted, including: the impact of ionizing radiation resulting from nuclear weapons use; the ability to benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear energy; and access to education and training in nuclear science and engineering. She cited the efforts of civil society and United Nations organizations such as the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) in the field of gender equality. \"Civil society provides evidence, expertise, advice and ideas that spurs us on to meaningful action,\" she said.\n\nANATOLIO NDONG MBA (Equatorial Guinea), associating himself with the African Group and Non-Aligned Movement, called on nuclear-armed States to renew their commitment to achieve their disarmament and non-proliferation goals. Unfortunately, there has been no progress on the aims of the Treaty, but rather, efforts to modernize nuclear weapons with \"astronomical\" costs, while malnutrition, disease and the effects of climate change devastate humanity. He expressed hope the Conference will agree on an internationally verifiable disarmament timetable, stressing: \"It is time for a new approach to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation\". It is essential that States comply with IAEA safeguards agreements without reservation. Equatorial Guinea has signed and ratified all relevant international instruments, he said, adding his voice to those supporting the use of atomic energy for civilian purposes in the areas of agriculture, food and health. In Africa -- a nuclear-weapon-free zone -- minerals, such as uranium and plutonium necessary for the development of these weapons, should not be traded for military purposes. He expressed his strongest condemnation of nuclear tests, renewal or threats of use and improvement of nuclear arsenals, stressing that the possession and production of such weapons should be regarded as a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.\n\nJOS\u00c9 MANUEL RODR\u00cdGUEZ CUADROS (Peru) said nuclear-weapon States must provide non-nuclear-weapon States with effective universal, unconditional, irreversible and legally binding security guarantees against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in all circumstances. \"We see the expansion of military alliances, which may be called nuclear alliances, that undermine commitments under the Non-Proliferation Treaty aimed at reducing dependence on nuclear weapons,\" he said, voicing concern about how strategic defence alliances that involve the exchange of technology for nuclear-propulsion submarines could jeopardize the non-proliferation regime. Nuclear-weapon-free zones play a critical role in the promotion of both disarmament and non-proliferation. As a party to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco), his country has witnessed the benefits those zones can provide, he said, noting that they could enhance regional security, particularly in areas of high tension, and promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and technology. The international community must adopt specific measures to strengthen cooperation among the different nuclear-weapon-free zones, he said, adding that the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, in accordance with the 1995 resolution, will be critical for stability and peace in that region.\n\nKYAW MOE TUN (Myanmar), associating himself with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Non-Aligned Movement, pointed to several nuclear \"close calls\" -- a reminder that disaster is \"just a few keystrokes away\". The only guarantee against the use of nuclear weapons is to eliminate them in a verifiable and irreversible manner. He called for strengthening the Treaty and decisions adopted at past Review Conferences. While most non-nuclear-weapon States have taken \"considerable\" measures to uphold the three pillars, nuclear-weapon States have not pursued the disarmament pillar with corresponding urgency. He encouraged the peaceful use of nuclear energy, underscoring the paramount importance that its development comply with IAEA guidelines and that the safety of nuclear facilities is ensured. \"We condemn the attacks on nuclear facilities at under any circumstance, anywhere, anytime and by anyone,\" he asserted. He raised alarm at the record number of ballistic missiles launched by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 2022 and urged it to comply with relevant Security Council resolutions, calling as well on Annex II States to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Myanmar's civilian Government had planned to ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, bring the IAEA Additional Protocol -- signed in 2013 -- into force and adhere to the Modified Small Quantity Protocol, however, with the dissolution of Parliament by the military junta, \"these plans have been derailed,\" he explained. \"History tells us that the military junta has never been a good partner in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.\" He urged the international community to \"keep an eye on\" the illegal junta so it does not jeopardize what Myanmar has accomplished.\n\nMILIKO LABA (Botswana), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group, expressed concern over the current fragile state of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regimes due to actions that undermine and violate the principles of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. He called for States parties to reaffirm their commitment to its three pillars, mustering the political will, good faith, and spirit of consensus to deliver a successful outcome. Commending the IAEA for its work in promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy, he noted the Agency has also facilitated Botswana's access to nuclear technology to prevent and control livestock diseases and crop production. He further recognized the efforts of other United Nations entities in supporting disarmament and non-proliferation, including the General Assembly as a norm-setting platform, and the Secretariat in implementing Member States' mandates. Botswana has received capacity-building support from the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004), and the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs in collaboration with the United States, the European Union and other partners.\n\nSONIA FERNANDEZ MORENO, Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials, said the Agreement between Argentina and Brazil for the Exclusively Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy, which entered into force in 1991, established a common system of control applied to all nuclear materials and facilities -- an innovative arrangement, as there is still no similar system in the world. The accord outlines a mission of verifying and guaranteeing that all nuclear materials and facilities in both countries are used for exclusively peaceful purposes, with Brazilian inspectors verifying Argentine nuclear materials and activities, and vice versa, under the purview of a technical Secretariat. Despite the COVID-19 crisis, the agency carried out all planned verification activities between 2020 and 2022. Cooperation was of \"fundamental importance\" to that end, he said, adding that the agency cooperates with the IAEA to improve the coordination of safeguards activities, on the basis that both entities are able to reach independent conclusions. It also maintains close cooperation with the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, the United States Department of Energy and the Korea Institute of Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Control, as well as with technical associations, such as the European Safeguards Research and Development Association and the Institute of Nuclear Materials Management.\n\nMAGED ABDELFATTAH ABDELAZIZ, Permanent Observer for the League of Arab States, associating himself with the Arab Group and Non-Aligned Movement, spotlighted the current \"trust crisis\" resulting from a lack of progress in nuclear disarmament coupled with State efforts to modernize their nuclear arsenals to promote nuclear deterrence. He also expressed concern over the eroded credibility of the non-proliferation regime, pointing out that some States parties are violating article I of the Non-Proliferation Treaty by supporting Israel in the nuclear field. Israel is the only Middle Eastern State that remains outside the Treaty, and it must accede to that instrument and subject its nuclear facilities to the IAEA's safeguards system. Noting that all Arab States have joined the Treaty -- motivated by the promise of increased security -- he stressed that the lack of progress in establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East has led to \"deep negative effects\", complicated further by Israel's ambiguity regarding its nuclear facilities and capacities.\n\nHe went on to underscore that this increases tension and instability in the Middle East region, reiterating the need to intensify efforts to establish such a zone. Further, States' inalienable right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes must be respected, rather than being exploited to impose further restrictions under the guise of non-proliferation. He added that, for this Conference to be considered a success, its outcome document must address several important issues, including the need for Israel to accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear State; the need to intensify efforts to establish a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction; and the lack of progress in nuclear States' commitment to nuclear disarmament, as such States have now \"transferred the arms race to outer space\".\n\nFL\u00c1VIO ROBERTO BONZANINI, Secretary-General of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, noted that unlike previous Conferences, a Fourth Conference of Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones and Mongolia did not precede this one -- despite those periodic conferences being of the utmost importance. He therefore called for all involved States to agree on the dates for convening that Fourth Conference and choose its coordinator. This atypical situation should not set a precedent, he stressed, calling for the next Review Conference to be held immediately after the Conference of Nuclear-Weapon- Free Zones, as has been the case since 2005. He noted that since the last Review Conference, the risk has increased, with the real possibility of a new military and nuclear competition that will endanger international peace and security. The dismantling of historical agreements and erosion of international norms \"force us to do everything possible to reaffirm our collective commitment,\" he stressed.\n\nThe Treaty of Tlatelolco, the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty establish norms of international law and are a suitable legal basis for completely eliminating all nuclear weapons in a transparent, verifiable and irreversible manner. Also citing the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as a complement to the Treaty of Tlatelolco, he noted that the member States of his Agency played a crucial role in the former. Noting the States Parties to the Treaty of Tlatelolco submitted a working paper with punctual recommendations for consideration, he urged the Tenth Review Conference to include those elements in a final document.\n\nCOLLIN NAMALAMBO, speaking for the African Commission on Nuclear Energy, and the African States parties to the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (the Pelindaba Treaty), explained that the African Commission is the Secretariat of the Pelindaba Treaty. The African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone -- together with the four other zones in Latin America and the Caribbean, South Pacific, Southeast Asia and Central Asia, and the zone in Mongolia -- comprise 114 States and almost 40 per cent of the world's population. He highlighted progress made in reducing the geographical footprint of nuclear weapons, encouraging the five nuclear-weapon States to prioritize ratification of all applicable protocols within the current Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaties. The African Commission seeks to engage with them and Spain as soon as possible on the ratification the Pelindaba Treaty protocols. It is also engaging with the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Central Asian Nuclear Weapons Free Zone to enhance coordination, and plans similar engagement with the other zones. He voiced support for IAEA's General Conference resolutions on the establishment of a mutually and verifiable nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East and encouraged Annex II States in particular to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, acknowledging initiatives by the Zangger Committee, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group related to the interpretation of Non-Proliferation Treaty article III.\n\nWENDIN D. SMITH, Acting Assistant Secretary General of the Political Affairs and Security Policy Division of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and Director of the Arms Control, Disarmament, and Weapons of Mass Destruction Non-Proliferation Centre, said NATO's new Strategic Concept underscores its enduring commitment to the Treaty. In contrast, the Russian Federation's war in Ukraine undermines all three pillars of the Treaty, she said, describing its nuclear threats and rhetoric as \"dangerous and irresponsible\", and its activities as being in direct contravention of the most recent leaders' statement by the five permanent Security Council members. The Russian Federation undermined the non-proliferation pillar by violating the Budapest Memorandum, while its actions related to Ukraine's civilian nuclear power plants undermine the pillar on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The Conference outcome should reaffirm the commitment by all States to the Treaty, recognize its enduring benefits and reinforce the non-proliferation regime.\n\nFor its part, NATO leaders at their June summit reiterated the goal of a world without nuclear weapons and resolved to take steps to create the conditions for disarmament negotiations. She explained that after the cold war, allied countries \"dramatically\" reduced the number of nuclear weapons stationed in Europe, took \"considerable\" steps to ensure NATO's nuclear deterrent capabilities remain safe, secure and effective, and have consistently supported efforts towards strategic risk reduction -- efforts that advance implementation of article VI. NATO continues to oppose the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as it is not an effective tool for reaching the goal of a world without nuclear weapons. \"As long as nuclear weapons exist, NATO will remain a nuclear alliance,\" she affirmed. The purpose of NATO's nuclear capability has always been to preserve peace, prevent coercion and deter aggression. Allies have always adhered to their Treaty obligations and will continue to do so, while nuclear sharing arrangements have always been and are consistent with the accord.\n\nFABIAN RUTHERFORD, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), affirmed that the Treaty has been the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime for more than 50 years, stressing that it has been \"a remarkable success\" in reducing the risk of nuclear proliferation, keeping the global disarmament goal on the multilateral agenda and promoting peaceful nuclear energy use. Yet, the multilateral approach to arms control has eroded, as several agreements and commitments have been weakened, ignored or \"completely abrogated\". The Chemical Weapons Convention has been integral to disarmament and non-proliferation efforts, with more than 99 per cent of 72,000 metric tons of declared chemical weapons stockpiles having been destroyed under robust verification by OPCW. He expected the destruction of all declared stockpiles to be achieved in 2023, adding that the Convention has near universal reach, with 193 States parties.\n\nHowever, he said recent chemical weapons use in Iraq, Malaysia, the Russian Federation, Syria and the United Kingdom have placed the international norm against these heinous weapons under pressure. The fears and threat of their use in the war in Ukraine have added to the concern. Further, Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Da'esh) has demonstrated in Iraq and Syria that the danger posed by non-State actors using chemical weapons is no longer a theoretical possibility. While developments in chemical production technology and the rapid expansion of the chemical industry help to advance and broaden the peaceful uses of chemistry, he said these changes, conversely, also heighten the risks of diverting toxic chemicals, technology and know-how into the wrong hands. \"In managing these challenges, effective national implementation of international obligations is our first line of defence,\" he explained. In 2023, OPCW will reach key milestones that will shape the Convention's implementation, among them, its new Centre for Chemistry and Technology, which will provide a new, high-quality tool for OPCW to conduct chemical research, analysis and training.\n\nMOHAMED YAHIA ALIBI of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said that, while the professed purpose of nuclear deterrence is to maintain national and regional security, the existence of nuclear weapons poses major risks to human security. Accepting such weapons as an indispensable part of security is indefensible, dangerous logic, he stressed, expressing doubt that they could ever be used in accordance with international humanitarian law. He went on to say that prohibition is an essential step towards nuclear disarmament and that, in this respect, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons complements and supports the objectives of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. \"Through prohibition, it creates a disincentive for proliferation,\" he said. Adding that the international community stands at a \"critical juncture for nuclear disarmament\", he noted that the ICRC has submitted a working paper with recommendations on how this Conference can contribute tangibly to nuclear disarmament. These include risk-reduction measures, renewed commitment to the total elimination of nuclear weapons, cooperation with the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and disarmament education.\n\nRight of Reply\n\nThe representative of Germany, exercising the right of reply, referred to unfounded accusations by a State party that NATO's nuclear sharing arrangements are in breach of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The fundamental purpose of NATO's nuclear capability is and has always been to preserve peace, prevent coercion, and deter aggression, he said. NATO's nuclear sharing arrangements, which include United States nuclear weapons forward-deployed in Europe and dual-capable aircraft provided by a number of European allies, continue to be fully consistent and compliant with the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Those arrangements were put in place well before the Treaty entered into force in 1970. That resulted in seamless integration of NATO's nuclear sharing arrangements into the Treaty, which was negotiated with NATO's arrangements in mind, and which has long been accepted and publicly understood by all States parties to the Treaty. The United States maintains full custody and control over its nuclear weapons forward-deployed in Europe, which fully conforms with articles I and II of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, he said.\n\nThe representative of the United States, exercising the right of reply, responded to Iran's statement yesterday afternoon and stressed that the suggestion that the United States assists any State inside or outside the Non-Proliferation Treaty to develop nuclear weapons is an absolute fabrication. The United States complies strictly with its Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations and hopes that every State party operates in the same way. He noted that United States President Joseph Biden has directed it to reduce the role of nuclear weapons, emphasize strategic stability, and facilitate risk reduction and arms control agreements. \"We have completed a deliberate nuclear policy that advances each of those goals,\" he said, adding that if States parties are interested in a factual discussion of those issues, they are welcome to join his delegation's high-level side event on United States nuclear policy tomorrow in Conference Room 4.\n\nThe representative of Iran, responding to the \"unfounded accusations and unacceptable statements\" made by the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and others concerning Iran's peaceful nuclear programme, underscored that his country has the inalienable right to enjoy the peaceful use of nuclear energy like other States parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Those countries, which are actively involved in modernizing their nuclear arsenals and extending unqualified support to the Israeli regime, have no moral ground to give those hypothetical statements.

This came during the statement of Qatar delivered by HE Permanent Representative of the State of Qatar to the United Nations Sheikha Alya Ahmed bin Saif al-Thani in the Tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT being held in UN Headquarters in New York from Aug 1 to 26, 2022.\n\nHE Permanent Representative of the State of Qatar to the United Nations indicated that the review conference is being convened in a very complicated situation as nuclear weapons still pose a profound threat to mankind and the nonproliferation regime is exposed to numerous challenges, where the consecutive international crises and the global economic imbalances are adversely affecting the expansion and enhancement of the peaceful utilisation of atomic energy, especially in the developing countries that suffer from the decline of the opportunities of sustainable development. She pointed out that the conference can further underscore the keenness of upholding the contractual obligations to the international community and ensure the importance of the treaty as an effective tool for collective security through pursuing practical steps for fair and balanced implementation of its three core pillars, including nonproliferation, disarmament, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\n\nHE Sheikha Alya called for initiating the multi-lateral negotiation context to attain a binding document that achieves the goal included in the sixth article of the treaty, emphasising that pending attainment of that goal, there would be an exigent need for finding out an international instrument that is legally binding for all nuclear weapons states to essentially pledge to provide safeguards to non-nuclear-weapon states parties to the treaty to refrain from using nuclear weapons or threaten to use them against the states.\n\nHE Permanent Representative of the State of Qatar emphasised the significance of enhancing NPT's regime to ensure that peaceful uses of nuclear energy are not diverted to other purposes to make sure that IAEA's safeguards system, which is essentially formulated with the additional protocol, constitutes the cornerstone of verification of nuclear non-proliferation regime to achieve the treaty's goals, pointing out that IAEA is the international agency which is solely entrusted to conduct verification that requires all kinds of support from the entire states to further undertake that role.\n\nHE Sheikha Alya Ahmed bin Saif al-Thani underscored that the international verification regime will remain deficient unless it is accompanied by concerted efforts to halt the nuclear arms race, in addition to reducing nuclear stockpiles, and ultimately attain nuclear disarmament, stressing the importance of exerting the assiduous efforts for the sake of achieving the treaty's universality, calling for the necessary accession of non-nuclear states parties to the treaty as nonnuclear states.\n\nShe stressed that the entitlement for the peaceful use of atomic energy is an inalienable right of the states which remains an integral part of their rights in development and is considered one of the three pillars of the treaty, expressing her appreciation and gratitude for IAEA for enhancing and expanding the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health, and prosperity in the entire world, calling for fostering IAEA's role in supporting the peaceful uses of atomic energy, particularly the technical co-operation program which is deemed the key tool of IAEA to transfer nuclear technology to the member states for peaceful uses.\n\nHE Sheikha Alya Ahmed bin Saif al-Thani also urged advanced states in the nuclear industry to provide scientific and technical assistance to the developing countries which need greater support, including expanded international co-operation. In the statement of the State of Qatar, HE Permanent Representative of the State of Qatar to the UN also tackled the decision of the 1995 Review Conference concerning the Middle East, where she stressed that it is an integral part of infinite treaty extension deal, and will remain valid pending accomplishment of its goals.\n\nShe added that there is the collective responsibility of establishing the region imposed by documents and international resolutions, including UN Security Council's Resolutions No. 487 of 1981 and 687 of 1991, emphasising that the persistent absence of progress toward establishing the region has grave consequences that might potentially threaten regional and international peace and security, indicating that the review conference called for rectifying the track and take further effective steps to achieve progress in establishing the region.\n\nShe called on all treaty member states to reach an essential consensus in order for the conference to come out with a final document that advances the joint action towards the full accomplishment of the NPT objectives.", "source": {"uri": "gulf-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gulf-Times"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.gulf-times.com/Content/Upload/Slider/820224225617312696930.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 2, "stanza_neu": 9, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 12, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 2, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7137582750", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-03", "time": "00:41:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-03T00:41:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T23:57:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4313725531101227, "url": "https://www.opb.org/article/2022/08/02/eugene-peace-activists-to-commemorate-dropping-of-atomic-bombs-on-japan/", "title": "Eugene peace activists to commemorate dropping of atomic bombs on Japan", "body": "This Saturday in Eugene, peace activists will mark the 77th anniversary of the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan.\n\nThe Second World War ended shortly after the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed by the United States.

But can Colorado afford nuclear power?\n\nThree coal-burning units at Craig will be closed between 2025 and 2030. Those plants and associated mining provide the Moffat County School District with roughly 20% of its property tax base and many jobs that pay uncommonly well for rural Colorado.\n\nA nuclear power plant rising like a phoenix from the ruins of coal could use existing high-voltage transmission and deliver at least some of the lost jobs.\n\nToo, a new-generation nuclear power plant could supplement Colorado's abundant wind and solar generation. Utilities say they have figured out how to achieve 85%, possibly even 90% emissions-free electricity from renewables without risking reliability and raising rates extravagantly. Nobody yet has the answer for that last 10% to 15%. Nuclear could help.\n\nThe Associated Governments of Northwest Colorado, a five-county planning agency based in Rifle, has emerged as a fulcrum for this conversation. As first reported by the Grand Junction Sentinel, members met in June with state Sen. Bob Rankin, a Republican from Garfield County, to talk about the potential.\n\nRankin in the last legislative session tried to get fellow legislators to appropriate $500,000 (amended to $250,000) to study the potential for nuclear. \"If we really believe that climate change is an existential threat, then how can we not look at every option,\" Rankin said in introducing his bill.\n\nSome who testified at the committee meeting cited environmental concern. A couple of self-identified environmentalists testified in support because, they said, nuclear does provide emissions-free energy. More than 19% of all U.S. emissions-free electricity comes from nuclear.\n\nConspicuously absent was support from the administration of Gov. Jared Polis. The bill failed 3-2 on a party-line vote.\n\nNuclear has a nagging problem, though. It's expensive. Advocates rarely mention this. Costs of Georgia's Plant Vogtle, the only U.S. nuclear power plant under construction, have ballooned from $14 billion to now $30 billion-plus. In South Carolina, investors pulled the plug on a nuclear power plant after spending $9 billion. It has become among the very costliest of energy sources, only slightly less than rooftop solar, according to Lazard, the financial analyst.\n\nModular nuclear reactors have been promoted as a way to shave costs. Specific projects have been conceived in both Idaho and Wyoming. Bill Gates is an investor in the latter. Maybe they will overcome this cost problem. We won't really know for another 10, maybe 15 years.\n\nState Sen. Chris Hansen remains skeptical. He has expertise unsurpassed among legislators. He set out to become a nuclear engineer after first laying eyes on a reactor when a high school junior from the farm country of Kansas. He got his degree but had already turned his attention to economics. He went on to earn degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and, from Oxford, a Ph.D. in resource economics.\n\nNuclear, he told a county commissioner from Sterling in 2019, when I first heard him answer this question, simply does not compete in cost. Last week, when we talked, he offered more detail.\n\n\"I think those technologies will have to prove themselves,\" he said of modular nuclear reactors. \"Right now, in the best-case scenario it looks like they will deliver electricity at $60 to $70 per megawatt-hour. Wind and solar are coming in at less than $20.\"\n\nThe sun doesn't always shine, the wind doesn't always blow, and we have very little long-term storage.\n\n\"Absolutely there is extra value for a power plant that you can operate at the flip of a switch, but keep in mind those (coal-burning) units have high rates of unreliability because of maintenance needs and breakdowns, and some nuclear plants have had the exact same problems,\" he said.\n\nHansen suggests that reliability may more economically be provided by less expensive alternatives. For example, he has pushed transmission and passed legislation to create organized markets that will allow electricity to be moved across broader geographic areas in response to consumer demands. Colorado is currently an island with limited bridges to other areas.\n\nXcel Energy, Colorado's largest utility, also has a wait-and-see attitude. In June, I asked Alice Jackson, who now directs planning for Xcel Energy across its eight-state service territory, what her company must see. \"Cost-effective investment in construction of the new versions,\" she said. Xcel, she added, will be paying attention.\n\nWill the new generation of nuclear become cost-effective? Perhaps. We don't have all the answers to 100% emissions-free electricity even as we expand its use into buildings and transportation. Nuclear could be an answer. But it does come at a high cost. Any serious conversation must acknowledge that.", "source": {"uri": "aspentimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aspen Times"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://cdn.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/06/best.allen_-710x1024.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 41, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 54, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7139093381", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-04", "time": "05:05:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-04T05:05:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-04T05:04:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4274509847164154, "url": "https://www.chinadailyhk.com/article/284162", "title": "DPRK says will 'never tolerate' US accusation of its nuke program", "body": "In this photo taken on June 25, 2022, people attend a mass rally to mark the \"day of struggle against US imperialism\", on the 72nd anniversary of the three-year Korean War, which began on June 25, 1950, at the plaza of the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum in Pyongyang.

As government agencies and airlines work hand in hand to develop biofuels, some wonder if there is a cleaner alternative. Nuclear energy has been the subject of study by some engineers and experts in the military industry for decades. A nuclear plane not only would it reduce the carbon footprint, but it would be able to operate 24/7.\n\nWhile the idea of a jet-powered plane sounds good on paper, its implementation is more complex what it seems like. Years of studies and experiments by the United States and the USSR during the Cold War concluded that nuclear planes are impractical and dangerous. Issues such as radiation or the consequences of a possible plane crash prevented governments from adopting this energy source in the mid-20th century.\n\nAfter decades of technological progress, the question of whether it would be possible to develop a round nuclear plane is again being raised. A report from the NATO Energy Security Center of Excellence studies whether it is possible to design a jet-powered aircraft today. This energy source, which powers submarines and warships, is considered vital in future military operations.\n\nWould it be possible to exchange the engines of an Airbus A320 for small jets? To answer this question we first have to travel back in time.\n\nNuclear planes were part of the first ideas that man had after the discovery of fission in 1938. Prior to the space race, The United States and the Soviet Union competed for nearly a decade to develop a nuclear propulsion system that would be integrated into bomber and reconnaissance aircraft. The idea of an aircraft that did not have to be refueled would give a considerable advantage to whoever developed it first.\n\nAccording to the document The Cold War competition for a nuclear-powered aircraftthe first to propose a nuclear aircraft was Henry Fermi, an Italian physicist who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1938 and was part of the Manhattan Project. In 1942, Fermi considered using nuclear power in aircraft, which led to the creation of the Nuclear Power Project for Aircraft Propulsion in 1946.\n\nThe US government has funded five years of research and development on possible nuclear aircraft projects. Later, in 1951, companies such as General Electric, Convair, Lockheed and Pratt & Whitney were invited to collaborate. The Atomic Energy Commission and the Air Force left it to private contractors to development of aircraft capable of flying with the help of a jet.\n\nAround the same time, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Air Force focused their efforts on developing a nuclear turbojet engine. Known as CAMAL, the engine was to be fitted to an intercontinental bomber. A memorandum from the Commission anticipated that it would be possible to carry out routes of one or more round the world with a load of the reactor.\n\nThe first nuclear aircraft experiments were conducted with two modified bombers carrying a test reactor. convair he took two B-36s and retrofitted them with a sealed cockpit that could hold three crew members and two engineers. The thick windows up to 30 centimeters thick were necessary to isolate a 1-megawatt reactor placed in the cargo bay.\n\nThough the armor proved effective in protecting the crew, its design revealed a problem that would be inherent in nuclear aircraft. To avoid radiation contamination, components were needed that would add weight to the aircraft. The cabin of the NB-36H weighed 11 tons, added to the 16 tons of the test reactor. Another drawback would be the protection of the reactor in the event of an accident.\n\nWith Cold War tensions on the rise and the arrival of the first intercontinental missiles, the Government of The United States considered that it was not necessary to develop a nuclear aircraft and dismantled the Convair NB-36H in 1957. The Soviets had managed to put the first artificial satellite into orbit, so the efforts of the Americans were focused on the space race.\n\nInterestingly, the nuclear aircraft program was officially canceled only in 1961. During these four years, the United States was aware of the Soviet Union's experiments in jet-powered aircraft.\n\nIn 1952, Igor Kurchatov, the designer of the Soviet atomic bomb, began a program with other scientists to develop nuclear-powered bombers. master minds like Sergei Korolev, Andrei Tupolev, or Vladimir Myasishchev sketched the first prototypes. However, the program received approval once the Soviets learned that the American Convairs had made successful flights.\n\nWhile the nuclear aircraft program was winding down in the United States, the USSR spent a lot of money producing its own version of the NB-36H. The Soviets developed the Lastochka, a Tupolev TU-95 modified to carry a nuclear reactor on board.\n\nThe Tu-95LAL had a pressurized cabin with a sensor to detect radiation. Behind it was a protective screen of lead and mixed materials. The reactor was installed in the cargo compartment, accompanied by a water-based cooling system. The Soviets installed multiple sensors in the fuselage to record radioactivity.\n\nAfter several delays, the Tu-95LAL made its first flight during the summer of 1961. Like its American counterpart, the Soviet nuclear plane flew with a reactor, but only to prove that they could isolate the crew. The Lastochka made 40 test flights, most between May and August 1961.\n\nAmerican intelligence was aware of the development of the Soviet program, however, it ruled out that the USSR had built a nuclear plane.\n\nThere are indications that the Soviets have engaged in an effort to produce some kind of nuclear powered aircraft (NPA). We estimate that in 1960 the Soviets were able to fly a test aircraft with at least one nuclear power unit providing useful thrust during one phase of the flight, but there is no evidence that prototypes were actually built.\n\nFor their part, the Soviets mounted a propaganda campaign to mislead the Americans. Rodion Malinovsky, Minister of Defense and Marshal of the Soviet Union, proposed promote a legend about the invention of an airplane powered by a nuclear engine \"with successful flight tests demonstrating the high technical performance of the reactor and its reliability\". Malinovsky and Pyotr Ivashutin, deputy chairman of the KGB, devised a disinformation campaign in late 1961.\n\nDespite the propaganda and positive test flight results, the Soviets realized that developing a nuclear aircraft was expensive and the benefits did not justify the investment. The first intercontinental missiles were successful and there was no need to design a nuclear aircraft to carry out bombing tasks.\n\nThe Soviet nuclear aircraft program was canceled in 1961although the Tu-95LAL made an additional 6 flights between 1961 and 1965.\n\nAlthough technology has advanced a lot compared to 1961, the idea of making nuclear aircraft has not crossed the minds of the military or scientists. The truth is that engineers face the same problems as sixty years ago. Designing a nuclear aircraft would involve considering an isolation system to prevent radioactive contamination.\n\nThe cabin would have to be sealed with materials such as steel, concrete, lead, cadmium or tungsten, which would add considerable weight to the aircraft. In addition to this, they must be considered cooling and emergency systems in case the reactor fails. Finally, protecting the reactor in case the plane suffers a damage would be the main limitation. A plane crash could turn into a catastrophe similar to Chernobyl, although to a lesser extent.\n\nAlthough the engineers of Boeing or Airbus designed a nuclear plane capable of flying over the Earth several times, regulators would prevent its operation. Few governments would authorize jet-powered aircraft to fly, especially if they leave a trail of radioactive emissions along their flight path.", "source": {"uri": "bullfrag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bullfrag"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/imgs.hipertextual.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Tupolev_tu95_avion_nuclear_wikimedia.jpg?fit=1600,1070&quality=50&strip=all&ssl=1", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 19, "stanza_neu": 40, "stanza_pos": 5, "swn_neg": 64, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7138044486", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-03", "time": "09:45:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-03T09:45:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-03T09:44:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4196078479290009, "url": "https://vietnamnews.vn/politics-laws/1274025/viet-nam-backs-nuclear-technology-for-peaceful-purposes.html", "title": "Vi\u1ec7t Nam backs nuclear technology for peaceful purposes", "body": "NEW YORK -- Vi\u1ec7t Nam supports the use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs H\u00e0 Kim Ng\u1ecdc told a panel discussion themed \"Non-proliferation, Nuclear Energy, and Climate Change\" chaired by US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm in New York on August 2 (US time).\n\nThe discussion was a side event of the Tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\n\nNg\u1ecdc reaffirmed Vi\u1ec7t Nam's commitments at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, especially the goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nHe appreciated the potential and benefits of nuclear power but said that its development needed to ensure international standards on nuclear security and safety and compliance with regulations on nuclear inspections.\n\nThe official also affirmed that Vi\u1ec7t Nam had seriously and fully fulfilled its national obligations to the International Atomic Energy Agency and pledged to continue supporting the agency's central role in using nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\n\nOn the same day, Ng\u1ecdc met and worked with UN Assistant Secretary-General for Strategic Coordination Volker Turk and heads of delegations from the UK, Kyrgyzstan, Norway, Romania, Slovenia and Australia to discuss bilateral issues, as well as international and regional situations, and priorities to be promoted at this Review Conference and cooperation at multilateral forums, especially the United Nations.\n\nNg\u1ecdc affirmed Vi\u1ec7t Nam's consistent policy in promoting the balance of the three pillars of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, saying that countries should continue accelerating the elimination of nuclear weapons.\n\nHe emphasised the right of nations to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, as well as the critical role of international law and the UN Charter in Vi\u1ec7t Nam's foreign policy.", "source": {"uri": "vietnamnews.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "vietnamnews.vn"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://image.vietnamnews.vn/uploadvnnews/Article/2022/8/3/232445_4287702436445131_un.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": 0.584313725490196, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 0, "stanza_neu": 8, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 8, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7141003350", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-05", "time": "13:48:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-05T13:48:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-05T13:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4156862795352936, "url": "https://www.syracuse.com/opinion/2022/08/nuclear-war-is-a-present-danger-to-humanity-guest-opinion-by-liz-theoharis-diane-swords.html", "title": "Nuclear war is a present danger to humanity (Guest Opinion by Liz Theoharis & Diane Swords)", "body": "The Rev. Dr. Liz Theoharis is the Director of the Kairos Center for Religions, Rights, and Social Justice at Union Theological Seminary. She is also the Co-Chair of the Poor People's Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival with the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II. She is an ordained minister in the Presbyterian Church (USA) and teaches at Union Theological Seminary in New York City.\n\nDiane Swords, Ph.D., is on the steering committee of Syracuse Peace Council, co-chair of Nuclear Free World Committee, and a regional leader in the national Back from the Brink Campaign. She lives in Syracuse.\n\nThis week marks the 77th anniversary of the atomic obliteration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For many, nuclear war may feel like a relic of that terrible history and of a time of great power struggle and the Cold War arms race. But that is a delusion we can no longer afford to maintain. Today, the war in Ukraine, growing tension in the South China Sea (evidenced by Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit), and more are reminding us just how close we are to global catastrophe. Indeed, earlier this week the Secretary-General of the United Nations warned that this is \"a time of nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War...today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation.\"\n\nAs governments, including our own, drag the globe closer to the brink, a huge majority of people everywhere oppose war and nuclear escalation. Here in the United States, many of us are realizing our common interests and joining together across our differences to say enough is enough. As we confront the worsening effects of climate disaster, economic recession and war, we refuse to be silent anymore!\n\nToday, many lies are used to divide us and try to convince us that on one hand we have no choice but to wage war, but on the other we can't afford to address human needs here at home. We mention just three of those lies here: 1. that war protects us; 2. that poverty is due to the failure of poor people; and 3. that the option of nonviolent de-escalation is out of our hands and that we should prepare for nuclear war.\n\nWar is a protection racket. We are told that our enemies are many, even as far-off wars are not won and only profit the few, while destroying the rest. Our military budget continues to grow at the same time politicians decry inflation and claim that working people need to take a pay cut and that there is not enough to spend on things like healthcare and housing. On top of that, funding for diplomacy has been radically cut in recent years. This is bad policy and is bringing us closer to moral bankruptcy and self-annihilation.\n\nThe lie that poverty is caused by the failure of poor people divests the government of any responsibility and further reinforces the logic of military spending over everything else. But this lie is countered by the valiant actions of poor people to improve their lot in spite of meager resources. Poverty is not inevitable; it is a \"systemic sin.\" Discrimination and disparities in access to employment, education, healthcare and more make it difficult for the hardest-working individuals to get ahead. Fair taxes, living wages and access to all the basic requirements for life should be rights for all humans. Instead, poor people are left with few resources, while the Pentagon receives almost everything it asks for.\n\nA third lie minimizes the grave risks of nuclear war and suggests that we can survive a nuclear attack if properly prepared. On July 11, 2022, New York City's Office of Emergency Management aired a PSA telling New Yorkers what to do if under nuclear attack: \"Get inside, stay inside and stay tuned.\" The New York Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (NYCAN) responded with words of warning: \"This shows a total lack of understanding of what thermonuclear weapons mean and how a single modern nuclear weapon would instantaneously and radically destroy our beloved city, killing millions of New Yorkers in seconds, making any preparedness or rescue effort an utter fantasy.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Aug. 9, the Syracuse Peace Council and allies will gather at 11:30 a.m. at the county courthouse, along with county legislators and others who have endorsed the Back from the Brink Campaign to prevent nuclear war. We are committed to \"ending nuclear weapons before they end us,\" as Beatrice Fihn of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said in accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017.\n\nIf you are working to change our current violent, racist system, to protect our environment, and to prevent violence at home and abroad, you are already part of this movement.

Credit - Brandon Huffman, CC SA 4.0.\n\nThe storm of headlines created by the UN's recent announcement that the world is one step away from nuclear annihilation was basically a weather report. Geopolitical crises continue to ramp up the rhetoric, as from Putin and North Korea. China is upgrading its nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe situation is basically a particularly stupid rehash of the past, but the possible numbers and types of triggers for a nuclear war are increasing. The Ukraine war includes a reminder of the days of brinkmanship and massive nuclear arsenals being created. It's hardly a safe situation.\n\nThe political penchant for melodrama isn't helping. Extreme political positions are now common and driving multiple problems in terms of basic sanity. Nuclear non-proliferation as explained by Secretary Guterres is essentially not an issue. Global politics is ignoring its obligations on a routine basis.\n\nThere is no strategy for nuclear non-proliferation. It's up to those with nuclear weapons, and they're doing nothing at all. A spectrum of \"personalities\", however, makes a strange cocktail of inter-reactive elements in a pretty dodgy mix.\n\nWorse, political power has increased to the extent of non-accountability in many countries. Authoritarianism, in any form, means by definition nobody interferes with decisions, particularly bad ones. Misjudgment is a common factor in many of the world's troubles, notably in Ukraine.\n\nThat means in turn that political mistakes can't be prevented, especially on the right, where only a few people can make decisions. This is what Guterres means by \"miscalculations\"; he just put it a lot more tactfully.\n\n... So how real is the risk? Real enough, in a strange way.\n\nThe tendency to react and overreact is a problem and a big one. Putin's almost automatic reference to nuclear weapons after the debacle in Ukraine is a case in point. It's a massive overreaction to a self-inflicted problem. A miscalculation in any possible sense of the word; but hardly a reassuring one.\n\nThere's a less obvious issue here - the logic of mistakes. The tendency of some political entities to talk themselves into progressively less workable positions. Putin is the classic example - A rationale which includes self-destruction. He raised the subject; but what can he do with it?\n\nThe theory here is that because something was said previously, something must be done about what was said, Therefore, the self-imposed situation, rational or otherwise, takes control of managing the issues. If self-created propaganda turns into the basis for an action, the likely result will be extreme.\n\nFor example - There is no rational basis for the Ukraine war to turn into anything more than what it is now. However - Having raised the nuclear issue for itself, Russia has to deal with the possibilities of its own statements and actions. It's a very dumb position, and getting out of a \"dumb\" position may require more intellect than that which created the problem.\n\nIn this case, simply eliminating the subject from discussion would be the easy option. That hasn't happened. Instead, Putin produced a treatise saying nuclear wars can't be won. That's hardly news to anyone, but if it means he's distancing himself from the subject, it's a positive. If it means he's reiterating a threat, it's a very negative situation.\n\nUnrealism - The other problem\n\nTo say that global politics is currently a mix of fantasy and unworkable options would be an understatement. Massive global issues are getting little attention. Meanwhile, the political horrors create nothing but human misery on a global scale, every day.\n\nIn the US, Trump, the epitome of being out of touch with everything, is still an issue. His legacy of irrationality is still obstructing rational behavior. In the UK, the idiocy of Brexit has sabotaged the nation and may even split it up. China has been spending billions if not trillions gearing up for a war with the world, which provided the money. Russia has basically taken every possible action to create unnecessary problems for itself.\n\nThese are all nuclear-armed nations. If this is how they mismanage their domestic affairs, the outlook for the future is bleak indeed, nukes or no nukes. These unreal politically created environments are simply self-destructive and nothing else.\n\nUpscale that situation just one step to the international level, and you get global dysfunction as we're now seeing. The people who can't manage themselves are dictating the course of human history. It can't work, and it won't.\n\nEven the terminology being used is out of date. \"Spheres of influence\" was one of the expressions used before World War One. It was a rationale for the war that poisoned the 20 century. The expression is now basically meaningless, but it's a policy consideration, cited in many areas of global geopolitics.\n\n\"Globalization\" is another trigger word. In the West, people get on their Chinese-made devices and complain about it. If globalization ended, the world's economies would collapse instantly. The US, EU, and China would go broke. That's the reality. Global trade has been a reality since the original Silk Road, and it's how the world does business. Is the world about to stop doing business? No? ...But it's an \"issue\", according to someone, and a driver for negative international relations.\n\nThe point being made here is that obsolete political thinking is driving the mistakes and miscalculations. These unreal situations are utterly out of whack with any useful progress. The political view, somehow, is to the past, not the future.\n\nYet again we have to ask, \"Where are the adults?\"\n\nNobody with even basic general knowledge can believe that the current global mess is rational, or properly managed. Brattish tantrums are driving miscalculations. Criminality and corruption in politics are making things worse. If you wanted a recipe for miscalculation, vested interests ignoring the interests of everyone else is a pretty toxic recipe.\n\nThere's no point in a war. The difference now is that everybody loses. The world is too small. The largest population in human history couldn't take the shock of a nuclear war. It can barely handle the collateral damage of the Ukraine war.\n\nHow many delusional idiots would you trust with nuclear weapons? Do you think the adults should be in charge? The human species can't afford these fools. This is a real risk in plain sight. There are no excuses.", "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_wallis@digitaljournal.com", "name": "Paul Wallis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.digitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FFF-6-1-974x576.png", "eventUri": "eng-7913137", "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 105, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 22, "stanza_neu": 65, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 88, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7136959801", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-02", "time": "13:10:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-02T13:10:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-02T13:10:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4117647111415863, "url": "https://www.daily-sun.com/post/635564/Bangladesh-urges-to-make-the-world-free-from-the-threat-of-nuclear-weapons", "title": "Bangladesh urges to make the world free from the threat of nuclear weapons | Daily Sun |", "body": "Bangladesh Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen has urged the international community to unite against the perpetual holding of nuclear weapons by a handful of states in total disregard of the safety and security of humanity.\n\nSpeaking at the 10th Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference held at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Hall in the UN Headquarters, on Monday (Aug 1).\n\nReferring to the clarion call to emancipate the world from the scourge of nuclear war, made by the Father of the Nation of Bangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in his historic maiden speech at the UN General Assembly in 1974, Momen said, \"That forms the cornerstone of Bangladesh's total and unwavering commitment to general and complete disarmament of nuclear weapons which is also a constitutional obligation of Bangladesh\".\n\nHe reiterated Bangladesh's support to the effective implementation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) through its three pillars -nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, said the Bangladesh Permanent Mission to UN in New York.\n\nIn this regard, he emphasised on the non-discriminatory implementation of Article IV of the Treaty, which recognizes the inalienable rights of all States to develop, research, produce, and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, including in power generation, healthcare and agriculture.\n\nThe Bangladesh Foreign Minister called for increased investment and international cooperation in the research of nuclear technology and explore the potentials of its peaceful use for the benefit of human kind.\n\nBangladesh acceded to the NPT on 27th September 1979 and was among the first few countries to ratify the Treaty on Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) in 2019.\n\nMeeting with UN Secretary-General\n\nOn the sidelines of the NPT Review Conference, Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen held a bilateral meeting with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nA range of UN and international issues, including UN peacekeeping operations, climate change, and the Rohingya issue, were discussed in the meeting.\n\nDuring the discussion on peacekeeping operations, the UN Secretary-General applauded Bangladesh's significant contribution to UN peacekeeping operations.\n\nIn response, Foreign Minister's request to recruit more Bangladeshi peacekeepers, the UN Secretary-General said that more peacekeepers, weapons, and ammunition would soon be taken from Bangladesh for various peacekeeping missions in Africa.\n\nBesides, the Foreign Minister requested that the Secretary-General to appoint more Bangladeshi officials to different political and military positions at the United Nations Headquarters.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General conveyed the gratitude of the international community to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for providing shelter to the displaced Rohingya and for offering continued humanitarian assistance to them.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General also expressed his gratitude to the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for agreeing to join the Global Crisis Response Group to deal with the challenges of conflict in Ukraine.\n\nMeeting with other leaders\n\nIn addition to the UN Secretary-General, Foreign Minister Momen held bilateral meetings with the leaders of various countries attending the NPT conference.\n\nAmong them are Slovenia's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ms.Tanja Fajon, Hungary's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Peter Szijiarto, and Argentina's Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Santiago Cafiero.

Is it time for a rethink?\n\nAt the very end of last year, Germany shut down half of its operating reactors as part of its long- standing policy to phase out nuclear power. Barely six months later and today the country is ramping up coal-fired capacity to meet its energy demand.\n\nGermany has the stated aim of eliminating coal from its energy mix by 2030. The overarching aim is to significantly reduce carbon emissions and avert catastrophic climate change. However, some 10GW of coal-fired capacity that had been mothballed is now expected to be returned to service. The move has been prompted by the conflict in Ukraine and the decision to reduce German dependence on imported Russian gas. Russia has also apparently recently cut the throughput on the main gas export pipeline to Germany by some 60%, making the need for more non-gas generation capacity that much more urgent to avoid shortages.\n\nUnder the auspices of short-term emergency legislation to resurrect coal, the thermal plant will be powered up for as much as two years. German economic minister Robert Habeck, ironically a member of the Green party, was quoted as saying the move was \"bitter but in this situation essential.\"\n\nAt the same time as Germany all but abandons its net zero goals, at least temporarily, it is expected to continue with its plans to abandon nuclear power too. Just three nuclear power plants are operating currently - Emsland, a 1406MW PWR; Isar 2, a 1485MW PWR; and Neckarwestheim 2 a 1400MW PWR - and they too are slated for closure by the end of the year. All Germany's working reactors began operations in the late-1980s and under current plans are being switched off after only around three decades. This would typically leave several decades of residual service life under different circumstances, although the German government has suggested that the technical and cost barriers to life extension are insurmountable. What is clear is that over the course of a single 12-month period Germany will have closed more than 8.5GW of operating nuclear generation.\n\nThe decision to press ahead with the nuclear shut down comes as the European Commission reveals plans to label some nuclear plants as \"green\" investments to reflect their low-carbon generation. However, Germany remains implacably opposed: \"Nuclear energy is not sustainable and should therefore not be part of the taxonomy. Accordingly, the Federal Government would vote for the Council to object,\" Germany's environment ministry said in a statement.\n\nBut given the urgency of the climate change challenge, it's hard to argue that nuclear power is not the sustainable option when the alternative is coal-fired capacity. Or that continuing to operate existing nuclear stations is a worse economic choice than launching a 20-year decommissioning programme that will cost north of \u20ac1.1bn per plant while the country faces an energy crisis.\n\nNonetheless, this is the direction that German energy policy is taking. And this is in spite of changing perceptions among the German populace. According to a YouGov survey from last November, 53% of Germans want nuclear to be a part of the energy mix, compared with just 28% who don't.\n\nIt seems that Germany is pursuing a nuclear energy policy that is based on dogma rather than pragmatism and it's a decision that will likely cost both the environment and the country's energy consumers dearly. Perhaps instead it is time to recognise that times have changed and take a new approach - Atomkraft?

Even those of us who pay scant attention to the ordinarily banal witterings of that organisation sat up and paid attention.\n\nAccording to Guterres: \"Humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation. We are now in a time of nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War.\"\n\nGuterres warned of the chaos in Ukraine, as well as other pertinent global issues, and urged the various leaders to go back to the spirit of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which came in to force in 1970 and - fun fact - was so driven by Irish diplomats that it became known as the Irish Treaty, which shows we can punch above our weight when we really want to.\n\nGuterres mentioned the Middle East and North Korea as potential problems, but we all know there are really only two elephants in the room we should be scared of - Russia and China.\n\nWhile all eyes have obviously been focused on the carnage unfolding in front of us every night in Ukraine, China has been paying keen attention to the West's response to Putin to see how far Beijing thinks it can go.\n\nAnd how far does it think it can go? Well, the fact that it announced this week that it would simply shoot down Nancy Pelosi if she even attempted to visit Taiwan could lead many observers to conclude China doesn't care about the West's response.\n\nThe country is newly emboldened against what it sees as a weak and sclerotic American president in charge of a soft and selfish society that simply doesn't have the stomach for a fight. It might even have a point.\n\nHowever, while events in the South China Sea could yet result in the world being dragged into a mutually destructive battle, it's only common sense to concentrate on what's happening in Europe, and what's happening seems to be getting worse with each passing day.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, every humiliating defeat suffered by Putin is making the world a more dangerous place. A man who seems to have abandoned even a pretence of sanity is surrounded by apparatchiks who have one major problem with their leader - and it's not that he went into Ukraine in the first place. Instead, their hawkish gripe is that he hasn't gone in hard enough.\n\nIt should be remembered that of the big nuclear powers, Russia is the only country to reserve the right to use a first-strike offensive tactic.
