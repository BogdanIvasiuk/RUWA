Pictured: Surveillance camera footage shows a flare landing at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant during shelling in Enerhodar, Ukraine March 4 - in the early days of Russia's invasion\n\nFire-damaged buildings at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex are pictured in March after coming under attack by Russian forces during the early stages of the invasion of Ukraine\n\nWhile it remains operational, experts have said they are worried about the condition of its 15 nuclear reactors, especially after shots were fired in its direction during the Russian advance.\n\nThe MoD said the area surrounding the power plant is being used as a base for artillery units to target Ukrainian forces on the banks of the Dnipro river, which runs alongside the site.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to quickly allow experts to visit the sprawling Zaporizhzhia complex to stabilize the situation and avoid a nuclear accident.\n\nWhether this visit takes place remains to be seen, with the MoD posting an update today about the power plant after five months of Russian occupation.\n\nOn it's daily intelligence update on Twitter, the MoD said: 'Following five months of occupation, Russia's intentions regarding the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant remain unclear. However, the actions they have undertaken at the facility have likely undermined the security and safety of the plant's normal operations.\n\n'Russian forces are probably operating in the regions adjacent to the power station and have used artillery units based in these areas to target Ukrainian territory on the western bank of the Dnipro river.\n\n'Russian forces have probably used the wider facility area, in particular the adjacent city of Enerhodar, to rest their forces, utilising the protected status of the nuclear power plant to reduce the risk to their equipment and personnel from overnight Ukrainian attacks.'\n\nEarlier this week Bridget Brink, the US ambassador to Ukraine, said there were 'credible reports' that Russian troops are using the site 'as the equivalent of a nuclear shield, firing at Ukrainians from around the plant'.\n\nRafael Grossi (pictured speaking in May), director general of the IAEA, said in an interview that the situation is getting more perilous every day at the Zaporizhzhia plant\n\nZaporizhzhia has six nuclear reactors, making it the largest of its kind in Europe, and accounts for about one quarter of Ukraine's power generation\n\nRafael Grossi, director general of the IAEA, said in an interview Tuesday that the situation is getting more perilous every day at the plant in the south-eastern city of Enerhodar, which Russian troops seized in early March, soon after their February 24 invasion of Ukraine.\n\n'Every principle of safety has been violated one way or the other. And we cannot allow that to continue,' he said.\n\n'What is at stake is extremely serious and extremely grave and dangerous.'\n\nGrossi cited many violations of the plant's safety, adding that it is 'in a place where active war is ongoing'.\n\nThe physical integrity of the plant hasn't been respected, he said, citing shelling at the beginning of the war when it was taken over and continuing information from Ukraine and Russia accusing each other of attacks at Zaporizhzhia.\n\nThere is 'a paradoxical situation' in which the plant is controlled by Russia, but its Ukrainian staff continues to run its nuclear operations, leading to inevitable moments of friction and alleged violence, he said.\n\nWhile the IAEA has some contacts with staff, they are 'faulty' and 'patchy,' he said.\n\nGrossi said the supply chain of equipment and spare parts has been interrupted, 'so we are not sure the plant is getting all it needs.'\n\nThe IAEA also needs to perform very important inspections to ensure that nuclear material is being safeguarded, 'and there is a lot of nuclear material there to be inspected,' he said.\n\n'When you put this together, you have a catalog of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility,' Grossi said.\n\n'And this is why I have been insisting from day one that we have to be able to go there to perform this safety and security evaluation, to do the repairs and to assist as we already did in Chernobyl.'\n\nPictured: Zaporizhzhia's six reactors are shown in this 2019 photograph\n\nOn Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Moscow of using the plant as a 'military base to fire at Ukrainians, knowing that they can't and won't shoot back because they might accidentally strike a nuclear... reactor or highly radioactive waste in storage.'\n\n'That brings the notion of having a human shield to an entirely different and horrific level,' he said.\n\nThe Russian capture of Zaporizhzhia renewed fears that the largest of Ukraine's 15 nuclear reactors could be damaged, setting off another emergency like the 1986 Chernobyl accident, the world's worst nuclear disaster, which happened about 65 miles north of the capital Kyiv.\n\nRussian forces occupied the heavily contaminated site soon after the invasion but handed control back to the Ukrainians at the end of March.\n\nGrossi visited Chernobyl on April 27 and tweeted that the level of safety was 'like a 'red light' blinking.' But he said Tuesday that the IAEA set up 'an assistance mission' at Chernobyl at that time 'that has been very, very successful so far.'\n\nThe IAEA needs to go to Zaporizhzhia, as it did to Chernobyl, to ascertain the facts of what is actually happening there, to carry out repairs and inspections, and 'to prevent a nuclear accident from happening,' Grossi said.\n\nA Russian serviceman stands guard outside Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station in May after Putin's troops occupied the site\n\nA Russian tank covered in green sheets outside the power plant. The UK Ministry of Defence has said Russia is using the power plant as a place to store equipment safe from Ukrainian strikes\n\nThe IAEA chief said he and his team need protection to get to the plant and the urgent cooperation of Russia and Ukraine.\n\nEach side wants this international mission to go from different sites, which is understandable in light of territorial integrity and political considerations, he said, but there's something more urgent and that is getting the IAEA team to Zaporizhzhia.\n\n'The IAEA, by its presence, will be a deterrent to any act of violence against this nuclear power plant,' Grossi said.\n\n'So I'm pleading as an international civil servant, as the head of an international organization, I'm pleading to both sides to let this mission proceed.'\n\nHis organization has been trying for weeks to send a team to inspect the plant. Ukraine has so far rejected the efforts, which it says would legitimize Russia's occupation of the site in the eyes of the international community.\n\n'Going there is a very complex thing, because it requires the understanding and cooperation of a number of actors,' particularly Moscow and Kyiv, as well as the backing of the United Nations since the plant is in a war zone, Grossi explained.\n\nThere are warnings that the power plant, which lies on the banks of the Dnipro river, is 'out-of-control' and fears a Chernobyl-like incident could take place\n\nA Russian soldier stands guard in the grounds of Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in May. Although the plant remains operational, there are concerns the Russian occupation has undermined security and safety at the station\n\n'I'm trying to put a mission back together to go there as soon as I can.'\n\nGrossi was in New York to deliver a keynote speech at Monday's opening of the long-delayed high-level meeting to review the landmark 50-year-old Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and eventually achieving a nuclear-free world.\n\nIn the interview, the IAEA chief also spoke about efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major powers that the Trump administration abandoned in 2018 and the Biden administration has been working to renew.\n\nGrossi said there is 'an ongoing effort to try to go for yet another meeting or round to explore possibilities to come to an agreement.' He said he heard the meeting 'could be soon.'\n\nBlinken told the NPT review conference on Monday that Iran 'has either been unwilling or unable' to accept a deal to return to the 2015 agreement aimed at reining in its nuclear program.\n\nCHERNOBYL: A Russian tank is seen in the contaminated Ukrainian city in the early days of the war, and before the northern parts of Ukraine were re-taken by Kyiv's forces\n\nServicemen of Ukrainian National Guard patrol area near the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in Chernobyl, Ukraine April 7, 2022\n\nPictured: A picture taken during a visit to Melitopol organized by the Russian military shows a woman walking past a Russian military truck in downtown Melitopol, Zaporizhzhia region, southeastern Ukraine, 14 July 2022\n\nGrossi said 'there are important differences among the negotiating parties' and important verification issues related to past activities that Iran needs to address. 'It's not impossible, it's complex,' he said.\n\nIf the nuclear agreement, known as the JCPOA, is not extended, he said some IAEA inspections will continue. But the JCPOA provides for additional transparency and inspections 'which I deem as extremely important, very necessary, because of the breadth and depth of the nuclear program in Iran,' he said.\n\nGrossi stressed that cooperating with the IAEA, answering its questions, allowing its inspectors to go wherever they need to be, is essential for Iran to build trust and confidence. 'Promises and good words will not do,' he said.\n\nOn another issue, Grossi said last September's deal in which the United States and Britain will provide Australia with nuclear reactors to power its submarines requires an agreement with the IAEA to ensure that the amount of nuclear material in the vessel when it leaves port is there when it returns.\n\nHe said Australia hasn't decided what type of vessel it will be getting, so while there have been preparatory talks, substantive talks can't begin.\n\nBecause it's a military vessel, Grossi said, 'there are lots of confidential and protection of information measures that need to be embedded into any such agreement, so it's very complex technologically.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_lodge@dailymail.co.uk", "name": "Matthew Lodge", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/08/03/10/61018881-0-image-a-13_1659517664400.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7916201", "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 20, "stanza_neu": 50, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 71, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7138606937", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-03", "time": "17:37:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-03T17:37:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-03T17:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8627451062202454, "url": "https://nypost.com/2022/08/03/un-nuclear-chief-warns-about-ukraines-zaporizhzhia-plant/", "title": "UN warns stability of Ukraine's nuclear plant is 'extremely grave'...", "body": "The UN nuclear chief on Tuesday warned that the situation at Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine \"is completely out of control\" -- and called on both Moscow and Kyiv to allow experts to access and inspect the site in a bid to avoid a potential catastrophe.\n\nRafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said the state at the Zaporizhzhia plant in the city of Enerhodar, which has been under Russian control since early March, is deteriorating by the day.\n\n\"Every principle of nuclear safety has been violated,\" Grossi said. \"What is at stake is extremely serious and extremely grave and dangerous.\"\n\nGrossi listed many violations of the plant's safety, adding that it is \"in a place where active war is ongoing,\" near Russian-controlled territory.\n\nThe physical integrity of the facility housing nuclear reactors hasn't been respected, he said, citing shelling at the beginning of the war when it was taken over and continuing information from Ukraine and Russia accusing each other of attacks at Zaporizhzhia.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Monday, citing accounts from Ukrainian officials, that Russians have been shelling towns from a position inside the nuclear plant, knowing that Ukrainian forces would not strike back for fear of triggering a nuclear blast.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence agency announced last month that it had used a suicide drone to attack Russian positions at the plant, killing three and injuring 12.\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday, Grossi explained that there is \"a paradoxical situation\" in which the plant is controlled by Russia, but its Ukrainian staff continues to run its nuclear operations, leading to inevitable clashes and alleged violence, he said.

Grossi visited Chernobyl on April 27 and tweeted that the level of safety was \"like a 'red light' blinking.\" But he said Tuesday that the IAEA set up \"an assistance mission\" at Chernobyl at that time \"that has been very, very successful so far.\"\n\nThe IAEA needs to go to Zaporizhzhia, as it did to Chernobyl, to ascertain the facts of what is actually happening there, to carry out repairs and inspections, and \"to prevent a nuclear accident from happening,\" Grossi said.\n\nThe IAEA chief said he and his team need protection to get to the plant and the urgent cooperation of Russia and Ukraine.\n\nEach side wants this international mission to go from different sites, which is understandable in light of territorial integrity and political considerations, he said, but there's something more urgent and that is getting the IAEA team to Zaporizhzhia.\n\n\"The IAEA, by its presence, will be a deterrent to any act of violence against this nuclear power plant,\" Grossi said. \"So I'm pleading as an international civil servant, as the head of an international organization, I'm pleading to both sides to let this mission proceed.\"\n\nGrossi was in New York to deliver a keynote speech at Monday's opening of the long-delayed high-level meeting to review the landmark 50-year-old Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and eventually achieving a nuclear-free world.\n\nIn the interview, the IAEA chief also spoke about efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major powers that the Trump administration abandoned in 2018 and the Biden administration has been working to renew.\n\nGrossi said there is \"an ongoing effort to try to go for yet another meeting or round to explore possibilities to come to an agreement.\" He said he heard the meeting \"could be soon.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the NPT review conference on Monday that Iran \"has either been unwilling or unable\" to accept a deal to return to the 2015 agreement aimed at reining in its nuclear program.\n\nGrossi said \"there are important differences among the negotiating parties\" and important verification issues related to past activities that Iran needs to address. \"It's not impossible, it's complex,\" he said.\n\nIf the nuclear agreement, known as the JCPOA, is not extended, he said some IAEA inspections will continue. But the JCPOA provides for additional transparency and inspections \"which I deem as extremely important, very necessary, because of the breadth and depth of the nuclear program in Iran,\" he said.\n\nRead More: TIME's Interview with Volodymyr Zelensky\n\nGrossi stressed that cooperating with the IAEA, answering its questions, allowing its inspectors to go wherever they need to be, is essential for Iran to build trust and confidence. \"Promises and good words will not do,\" he said.\n\nOn another issue, Grossi said last September's deal in which the United States and Britain will provide Australia with nuclear reactors to power its submarines requires an agreement with the IAEA to ensure that the amount of nuclear material in the vessel when it leaves port is there when it returns.\n\nHe said Australia hasn't decided what type of vessel it will be getting, so while there have been preparatory talks, substantive talks can't begin.\n\nBecause it's a military vessel, Grossi said, \"there are lots of confidential and protection of information measures that need to be embedded into any such agreement, so it's very complex technologically.\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1240274985.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "eventUri": "eng-7916201", "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 27, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 38, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7138027823", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-03", "time": "09:31:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-03T09:31:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-03T09:30:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.843137264251709, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11075895/UN-nuclear-chief-Ukraine-nuclear-plant-control.html", "title": "Europe's largest nuclear power plant 'is out of control', UN warns", "body": "UN organisation wants inspectors to ensure nuclear material is being protected\n\nThe United Nations nuclear chief has warned that Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine 'is completely out of control', raising fears of another Chernobyl disaster.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to quickly allow experts to visit the sprawling Zaporizhia complex to stabilize the situation and avoid a nuclear accident.\n\nRafael Grossi, director general of the IAEA, said in an interview Tuesday that the situation is getting more perilous every day at the plant in the south-eastern city of Enerhodar, which Russian troops seized in early March, soon after their February 24 invasion of Ukraine.\n\n'Every principle of safety has been violated one way or the other.

Located in Ukraine's southeastern city of Enerhodar, the plant was seized by Russian forces on March 3, in a battle that set a nearby training facility on fire.\n\nThe catalog of hair-raising misbehaviors mentioned by Grossi is long indeed. For one thing, the power plant is still up and running, under what the IAEA chief described as a \"paradoxical situation\": Russia controls Zaporizhzhia, but its original Ukrainian crew is still handling operations, and the two groups are not cooperating smoothly.\n\nGrossi said his agency had only \"faulty\" and \"patchy\" communications with the Ukrainian staff and could not guarantee they are receiving all the supplies they need.\n\nFurthermore, combat remains ongoing around the nuclear plant, including exchanges of artillery fire that have come perilously close to the plant's six reactors. Ukrainian and U.S. officials accuse Russia of using the facility as a base for attacking Ukrainian forces, apparently confident the Ukrainians would not dare to return fire at a nuclear power plant.\n\n\"There are credible reports, including in the media today, that Russia is using this plant as the equivalent of a human shield, but a nuclear shield in the sense that it's firing on Ukrainians from around the plant and of course, the Ukrainians cannot and will not fire back lest there be a terrible accident involving a nuclear plant,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken charged on Monday.\n\nThe Russians, in turn, accuse Ukraine of attacking the plant deliberately with American-supplied weapons while Russian troops valiantly protect it.

Grossi visited Chernobyl on April 27 and tweeted that the level of safety was \"like a 'red light' blinking.\" But he said Tuesday that the IAEA set up \"an assistance mission\" at Chernobyl at that time \"that has been very, very successful so far.\"\n\nThe IAEA needs to go to Zaporizhzhia, as it did to Chernobyl, to ascertain the facts of what is actually happening there, to carry out repairs and inspections, and \"to prevent a nuclear accident from happening,\" Grossi said.\n\nThe IAEA chief said he and his team need protection to get to the plant and the urgent cooperation of Russia and Ukraine.\n\nEach side wants this international mission to go from different sites, which is understandable in light of territorial integrity and political considerations, he said, but there's something more urgent and that is getting the IAEA team to Zaporizhzhia.\n\n\"The IAEA, by its presence, will be a deterrent to any act of violence against this nuclear power plant,\" Grossi said. \"So I'm pleading as an international civil servant, as the head of an international organization, I'm pleading to both sides to let this mission proceed.\"\n\nGrossi was in New York to deliver a keynote speech at Monday's opening of the long-delayed high-level meeting to review the landmark 50-year-old Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and eventually achieving a nuclear-free world.\n\nIn the interview, the IAEA chief also spoke about efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major powers that the Trump administration abandoned in 2018 and the Biden administration has been working to renew.\n\nGrossi said there is \"an ongoing effort to try to go for yet another meeting or round to explore possibilities to come to an agreement.\" He said he heard the meeting \"could be soon.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the NPT review conference on Monday that Iran \"has either been unwilling or unable\" to accept a deal to return to the 2015 agreement aimed at reining in its nuclear program.\n\nGrossi said \"there are important differences among the negotiating parties\" and important verification issues related to past activities that Iran needs to address. \"It's not impossible, it's complex,\" he said.\n\nIf the nuclear agreement, known as the JCPOA, is not extended, he said some IAEA inspections will continue. But the JCPOA provides for additional transparency and inspections \"which I deem as extremely important, very necessary, because of the breadth and depth of the nuclear program in Iran,\" he said.\n\nGrossi stressed that cooperating with the IAEA, answering its questions, allowing its inspectors to go wherever they need to be, is essential for Iran to build trust and confidence. \"Promises and good words will not do,\" he said.\n\nOn another issue, Grossi said last September's deal in which the United States and Britain will provide Australia with nuclear reactors to power its submarines requires an agreement with the IAEA to ensure that the amount of nuclear material in the vessel when it leaves port is there when it returns.\n\nHe said Australia hasn't decided what type of vessel it will be getting, so while there have been preparatory talks, substantive talks can't begin.\n\nBecause it's a military vessel, Grossi said, \"there are lots of confidential and protection of information measures that need to be embedded into any such agreement, so it's very complex technologically.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@dailysabah.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "image": "https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2022/08/03/thumbs/800x531/222335.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7916201", "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 26, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 36, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7141092511", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-05", "time": "15:05:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-05T15:05:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-05T14:11:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8313725590705872, "url": "https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/08/putins-next-crisis-could-russia-start-another-chernobyl-in-ukraine/", "title": "Putin's Next Crisis: Could Russia Start Another Chernobyl in Ukraine?", "body": "Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant -- Europe's largest -- was taken by Russian military forces in early March after they invaded Ukraine.

We know of allegations that live ammunition is stored in the plant and that there are attacks on the power plant,\" he said.\n\n\"Frankly, I can't determine that if I don't have access. There are contradictions between the accounts of the Russian and Ukrainian sides.

Rafael Grossi, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), stated that the situation in Ukraine's largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia, is becoming more dangerous every day, Associated Press reported. Further, the UN nuclear head issued an urgent appeal to Russia and Ukraine to grant specialists access to the vast complex quickly in order to restore stability and prevent a nuclear disaster.\n\nThe IAEA's Rafael Grossi stated in an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday, \"You have a catalogue of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility\". He expressed grave concerns about the Zaporizhzhia facility's \"patchy\" communication and his organisation's inability to visit the location.\n\nNotably, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in the city of Enerhodar, in the war-torn country's southeast, was seized by Russian troops in early March, not long after their invasion of Ukraine on February 24.\n\nAt the facility, Grossi asserted, \"Every principle of nuclear safety has been violated,\" adding that \"What is at stake is extremely serious and extremely grave and dangerous.\"\n\nThe IAEA is concerned whether the facility, which is now operating in Russian-controlled territory with Ukrainian staff, is getting all the supplies it needs to function effectively because the fighting has impacted its equipment supply. The IAEA head cited shelling at the onset of the conflict when it was seized and ongoing reports from Ukraine and Russia accusing one another of assaults at Zaporizhzhia as evidence that the plant's physical integrity had not been protected.\n\nThere is \"a lot of nuclear material\" that has to be inspected, Grossi added, and the IAEA must carry out crucial inspections to make sure it is properly secured. He said, \"And this is why I have been insisting from day one that we have to be able to go there to perform this safety and security evaluation, to do the repairs and to assist as we already did in Chernobyl.\"\n\nFurthermore, after the Russian occupation of Zaporizhzhia resurfaced, worries emerged that the largest of Ukraine's 15 nuclear reactors could sustain damage, Associated Press reported. This would trigger a similar disaster to the 1986 Chernobyl accident, the worst nuclear disaster in history, which occurred about 110 kilometres north of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\n\nThe IAEA director stated that in order to access the facility, he and his team urgently require Russian and Ukrainian assistance as well as protection.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia was charged earlier this week by United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken with using the facility, which it seized in March, as a military base to strike Ukrainian forces, BBC reported. According to Ukrainian officials, Russian personnel are stationed and military equipment is kept on the premises of the power plant on the Dnipro River in southern Ukraine.", "source": {"uri":

"body": "Situation is getting more perilous every day at the Zaporizhzhya plant in Ukraine, said Rafael Grossi\n\nThe UN nuclear chief warned that Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine \"is completely out of control\" and issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to quickly allow experts to visit the sprawling complex to stabilise the situation and avoid a nuclear accident.\n\nRafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press that the situation is getting more perilous every day at the Zaporizhzhya plant in the southeastern city of Enerhodar, which Russian troops seized in early March, soon after their February 24 invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"Every principle of nuclear safety has been violated\" at the plant, he said. \"What is at stake is extremely serious and extremely grave and dangerous.\" Grossi cited many violations of the plant's safety, adding that it is \"in a place where active war is ongoing,\" near Russian-controlled territory.\n\nThe physical integrity of the plant hasn't been respected, he said, citing shelling at the beginning of the war when it was taken over and continuing information from Ukraine and Russia accusing each other of attacks at Zaporizhzhya.\n\nThere is \"a paradoxical situation\" in which the plant is controlled by Russia, but its Ukrainian staff continues to run its nuclear operations, leading to inevitable moments of friction and alleged violence, he said. While the IAEA has some contacts with staff, they are \"faulty\" and \"patchy,\" he said.\n\nGrossi said the supply chain of equipment and spare parts has been interrupted, \"so we are not sure the plant is getting all it needs.\" The IAEA also needs to perform very important inspections to ensure that nuclear material is being safeguarded, \"and there is a lot of nuclear material there to be inspected,\" he said.\n\n\"When you put this together, you have a catalog of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility,\" Grossi said. \"And this is why I have been insisting from day one that we have to be able to go there to perform this safety and security evaluation, to do the repairs and to assist as we already did in Chernobyl.\"\n\nThe Russian capture of Zaporizhzhya renewed fears that the largest of Ukraine's 15 nuclear reactors could be damaged, setting off another emergency like the 1986 Chernobyl accident, the world's worst nuclear disaster, which happened about 110 km (65 miles) north of the capital Kyiv.\n\nRussian forces occupied the heavily contaminated site soon after the invasion but handed control back to the Ukrainians at the end of March. Grossi visited Chernobyl on April 27 and tweeted that the level of safety was \"like a 'red light' blinking\". But he said Tuesday that the IAEA set up \"an assistance mission\" at Chernobyl at that time \"that has been very, very successful so far\".\n\nThe IAEA needs to go to Zaporizhzhya, as it did to Chernobyl, to ascertain the facts of what is actually happening there, to carry out repairs and inspections, and \"to prevent a nuclear accident from happening,\" Grossi said. The IAEA chief said he and his team need protection to get to the plant and the urgent cooperation of Russia and Ukraine.\n\nEach side wants this international mission to go from different sites, which is understandable in light of territorial integrity and political considerations, he said, but there's something more urgent and that is getting the IAEA team to Zaporizhzhya.\n\n\"The IAEA, by its presence, will be a deterrent to any act of violence against this nuclear power plant,\" Grossi said. \"So I'm pleading as an international civil servant, as the head of an international organisation, I'm pleading to both sides to let this mission proceed.\"\n\nGrossi was in New York to deliver a keynote speech at Monday's opening of the long-delayed high-level meeting to review the landmark 50-year-old Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and eventually achieving a nuclear-free world.\n\nIn the interview, the IAEA chief also spoke about efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major powers that the Trump administration abandoned in 2018 and the Biden administration has been working to renew. Grossi said there is \"an ongoing effort to try to go for yet another meeting or round to explore possibilities to come to an agreement.\" He said he heard the meeting \"could be soon\".\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the NPT review conference on Monday that Iran \"has either been unwilling or unable\" to accept a deal to return to the 2015 agreement aimed at reining in its nuclear programme. Grossi said \"there are important differences among the negotiating parties\" and important verification issues related to past activities that Iran needs to address. \"It's not impossible, it's complex,\" he said.\n\nIf the nuclear agreement, known as the JCPOA, is not extended, he said some IAEA inspections will continue.

But the JCPOA provides for additional transparency and inspections \"which I deem as extremely important, very necessary, because of the breadth and depth of the nuclear program in Iran,\" he said.\n\nGrossi stressed that cooperating with the IAEA, answering its questions, allowing its inspectors to go wherever they need to be, is essential for Iran to build trust and confidence. \"Promises and good words will not do,\" he said.\n\nOn another issue, Grossi said last September's deal in which the United States and Britain will provide Australia with nuclear reactors to power its submarines requires an agreement with the IAEA to ensure that the amount of nuclear material in the vessel when it leaves port is there when it returns.\n\nHe said Australia hasn't decided what type of vessel it will be getting, so while there have been preparatory talks, substantive talks can't begin.\n\nBecause it's a military vessel, Grossi said, \"there are lots of confidential and protection of information measures that need to be embedded into any such agreement, so it's very complex technologically.\"", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat English"}, "authors": [{"uri": "asharq_al_awsat@english.aawsat.com", "name": "Asharq Al-Awsat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://english.aawsat.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2022/08/03/wghzf73drrmwtpox5nuaubiyqu.jpg?itok=mDcmWG8s", "eventUri": "eng-7916201", "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 26, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 37, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7138838658", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-03", "time": "22:16:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-03T22:16:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-03T22:15:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7843137383460999, "url": "https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/un-nuclear-chief-warns-about-ukrainian-nuclear-center/6685692.html", "title": "UN Nuclear Chief Warns about Ukrainian Nuclear Center", "body": "The United Nations nuclear chief has warned that Europe's largest nuclear power center is, in his words, \"completely out of control.\"\n\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, made the comment to the Associated Press (AP) Tuesday.

At the beginning of the war, the center was shelled and both sides accuse each other of attacking it.\n\nHe also called the situation \"paradoxical\" because the plant continues to operate with Ukrainian workers although Russia controls it. Grossi added that contact between the IAEA and the workers was \"faulty\" and \"patchy,\" meaning incomplete.\n\nIn addition, supply lines for equipment and parts had been interrupted. So, it is unclear if \"the plant is getting all it needs,\" said Grossi. He added that the IAEA needs to perform some very important inspections to make sure nuclear material is being safeguarded.\n\nThe Russian capture of Zaporizhzhia raised fears that the center with 15 nuclear reactors could be damaged. The fear was of another nuclear disaster like the one that took place in Ukraine's Chernobyl plant in 1986.

The Argentinian diplomat also spoke about the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major world powers. He said the negotiations were \"complex\" but \"not impossible.\"\n\nHe added that some IAEA inspections of Iran's nuclear program would continue without an agreement. But he noted that cooperating with the IAEA would help Iran \"build trust and confidence.\"\n\nGrossi also said that the nuclear submarine deal between the United States, Britain and Australia would require an agreement with the IAEA to make sure no nuclear material is lost.\n\nI'm Bryan Lynn.\n\nEdith M.

Earlier this week, the global nuclear watchdog said the situation was becoming increasingly perilous.\n\nThen, on Friday, explosions rang out at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power complex, the biggest of its kind in Europe, reigniting fears of a potential disaster.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the plant, which was taken over by Russian forces in early March, along with the town of Enerhodar, where the complex is located.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky blamed Moscow for the attack, calling the strikes a \"brazen crime\" and an \"act of terror.\"\n\n\"Today, the occupiers created another extremely risky situation for everyone in Europe,\" he said in his nightly address on Friday.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry denied the claim, saying the Ukrainians had carried out three artillery strikes on the plant and surrounding area. The ministry added that the generating capacity of one unit at the plant had been reduced, and power supply to another cut.\n\nUkraine's state-run nuclear power operator, Energoatom, accused Russian forces of hitting Zaporizhzhia plant and using the complex as a staging ground for striking nearby targets, including many in the occupied city of Enerhodar and the nearby Ukrainian-controlled city of Nikopol.\n\nWhen fierce fighting first broke out near the facility in the early days of the war, it sparked fears of a nuclear incident and prompted condemnations from the international community.\n\nRussian troops forced its managers to work \"at gunpoint\" after seizing the plant on March 5, according to Ukrainian nuclear officials. A week later, the Kremlin sent officials and technicians from Russia's state nuclear agency to help conduct repairs and manage the facility.\n\nUkrainian and Russian staff have been working alongside each other since, and communication with the outside world has been intermittent.\n\nEnergoatom said Friday that Russian shelling had hit in and around the nuclear complex and damaged a water intake facility, cutting power and water to much of Enerhodar.\n\n\"Three hits were recorded directly at the site of the station,\" the Ukrainian agency said, claiming that one was \"near one of the power units where the nuclear reactor is located.\"\n\nCNN was unable to verify claims of damage at the plant, which occupies a large site. Much of the recent Russian fire in the area has originated from near the plant and it is unclear if parts of the nuclear facility were hit accidentally.\n\nEnergoatom said on Saturday that the plant was operational and Ukrainian staff at the station continued to work to ensure radiation safety.\n\nUkrainian prosecutors have opened an investigation into the incident.\n\nZaporizhzhia plant 'out of control'\n\nThe exact danger posed by the blasts in and around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant remains unclear.\n\nThe head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, said in an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday that the situation at the plant was \"completely out of control.\"\n\n\"Every principle of nuclear safety has been violated,\" he said, calling on Russia and Ukraine to allow experts to visit the site. \"What is at stake is extremely serious and extremely grave and dangerous.\"\n\nOther officials have been more measured, pointing to the fact that recent nuclear energy facilities are designed to withstand terrorist attacks and natural disasters.\n\nSeveral Western and Ukrainian officials believe that Russia is now using the giant nuclear facility as a fortress to protect their troops and stage attacks, because they assume Kyiv will not retaliate and risk a crisis.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday accused Moscow of using the plant to shield its forces, and Ukraine has warned that shelling at the complex could be disastrous.\n\n\"The possible consequences of hitting an operating reactor are equivalent to the use of an atomic bomb,\" Ukraine's foreign ministry said Friday on Twitter.\n\nThe United Kingdom has said that the actions at the complex have undermined the safety of the plant's operations.\n\n\"Russian forces have probably used the wider facility area, in particular the adjacent city of Enerhodar, to rest their forces, utilizing the protected status of the nuclear power plant to reduce the risk to their equipment and personnel from overnight Ukrainian attacks,\" Britain's ministry of defense said Friday in an intelligence update on Twitter.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Enerhodar, Dmytro Orlov, said in late July that Russian forces had been observed using heavy weaponry near the plant because \"they know very well that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will not respond to these attacks, as they can damage the nuclear power plant.\"\n\nCNN's Joshua Berlinger, Lauren Kent, Yulia Kesaieva and Petro Zadorozhnny contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "egyptindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Egypt Independent"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://amayei.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2022/08/220806023306-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-file-exlarge-169.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7916201", "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 15, "stanza_neu": 17, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 32, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7138533990", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-03", "time": "16:28:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-03T16:28:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-03T16:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7803921699523926, "url": "https://siouxcityjournal.com/news/iaea-ukraine-nuke-plant-out-of-control/video_5bd39e03-a375-5f60-a335-b48da72a8c40.html", "title": "IAEA: Ukraine nuke plant 'out of control'", "body": "Dentist accused of killing wife on African safari to be with mistress testifies at trial, denies guilt\n\nThe U.N. nuclear chief warned that Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine \"is completely out of control\" and issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to quickly allow experts to visit the sprawling complex to stabilize the situation and avoid a nuclear accident.

"body": "Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press that the situation is getting more perilous every day at the Zaporizhzhya plant in the southeastern city of Enerhodar, which Russian troops seized in early March, soon after their Feb. 24. invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"Every principle of nuclear safety has been violated\" at the plant, he said. \"What is at stake is extremely serious and extremely grave and dangerous.\"\n\nGrossi cited many violations of the plant's safety, adding that it is \"in a place where active war is ongoing,\" near Russian-controlled territory.\n\nThe physical integrity of the plant hasn't been respected, he said, citing shelling at the beginning of the war when it was taken over and continuing information from Ukraine and Russia accusing each other of attacks at Zaporizhzhya.\n\nThere is \"a paradoxical situation\" in which the plant is controlled by Russia, but its Ukrainian staff continues to run its nuclear operations, leading to inevitable moments of friction and alleged violence, he said. While the IAEA has some contacts with staff, they are \"faulty\" and \"patchy,\" he said.\n\nGrossi said the supply chain of equipment and spare parts has been interrupted, \"so we are not sure the plant is getting all it needs.\" The IAEA also needs to perform very important inspections to ensure that nuclear material is being safeguarded, \"and there is a lot of nuclear material there to be inspected,\" he said.\n\n\"When you put this together, you have a catalog of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility,\" Grossi said. \"And this is why I have been insisting from day one that we have to be able to go there to perform this safety and security evaluation, to do the repairs and to assist as we already did in Chernobyl.\"\n\nThe Russian capture of Zaporizhzhya renewed fears that the largest of Ukraine's 15 nuclear reactors could be damaged, setting off another emergency like the 1986 Chernobyl accident, the world's worst nuclear disaster, which happened about 110 kilometers (65 miles) north of the capital Kyiv.\n\nRussian forces occupied the heavily contaminated site soon after the invasion but handed control back to the Ukrainians at the end of March. Grossi visited Chernobyl on April 27 and tweeted that the level of safety was \"like a 'red light' blinking.\" But he said Tuesday that the IAEA set up \"an assistance mission\" at Chernobyl at that time \"that has been very, very successful so far.\"\n\nThe IAEA needs to go to Zaporizhzhya, as it did to Chernobyl, to ascertain the facts of what is actually happening there, to carry out repairs and inspections, and \"to prevent a nuclear accident from happening,\" Grossi said.\n\nThe IAEA chief said he and his team need protection to get to the plant and the urgent cooperation of Russia and Ukraine.\n\nEach side wants this international mission to go from different sites, which is understandable in light of territorial integrity and political considerations, he said, but there's something more urgent and that is getting the IAEA team to Zaporizhzhya.\n\n\"The IAEA, by its presence, will be a deterrent to any act of violence against this nuclear power plant,\" Grossi said. \"So I'm pleading as an international civil servant, as the head of an international organization, I'm pleading to both sides to let this mission proceed.\"\n\nGrossi was in New York to deliver a keynote speech at Monday's opening of the long-delayed high-level meeting to review the landmark 50-year-old Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and eventually achieving a nuclear-free world.\n\nIn the interview, the IAEA chief also spoke about efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major powers that the Trump administration abandoned in 2018 and the Biden administration has been working to renew.\n\nGrossi said there is \"an ongoing effort to try to go for yet another meeting or round to explore possibilities to come to an agreement.\" He said he heard the meeting \"could be soon.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the NPT review conference on Monday that Iran \"has either been unwilling or unable\" to accept a deal to return to the 2015 agreement aimed at reining in its nuclear program.\n\nGrossi said \"there are important differences among the negotiating parties\" and important verification issues related to past activities that Iran needs to address. \"It's not impossible, it's complex,\" he said.\n\nIf the nuclear agreement, known as the JCPOA, is not extended, he said some IAEA inspections will continue.

Earlier this week, the global nuclear watchdog said the situation was becoming increasingly perilous.\n\nThen, on Friday, explosions rang out at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power complex, the biggest of its kind in Europe, reigniting fears of a potential disaster.Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the plant, which was taken over by Russian forces in early March, along with the town of Enerhodar, where the complex is located.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky blamed Moscow for the attack, calling the strikes a \"brazen crime\" and an \"act of terror.\"\"Today, the occupiers created another extremely risky situation for everyone in Europe,\" he said in his nightly address on Friday.Read MoreThe Russian defense ministry denied the claim, saying the Ukrainians had carried out three artillery strikes on the plant and surrounding area. The ministry added that the generating capacity of one unit at the plant had been reduced, and power supply to another cut. Ukraine's state-run nuclear power operator, Energoatom, accused Russian forces of hitting Zaporizhzhia plant and using the complex as a staging ground for striking nearby targets, including many in the occupied city of Enerhodar and the nearby Ukrainian-controlled city of Nikopol.When fierce fighting first broke out near the facility in the early days of the war, it sparked fears of a nuclear incident and prompted condemnations from the international community. Russian troops forced its managers to work \"at gunpoint\" after seizing the plant on March 5, according to Ukrainian nuclear officials. A week later, the Kremlin sent officials and technicians from Russia's state nuclear agency to help conduct repairs and manage the facility. Ukrainian and Russian staff have been working alongside each other since, and communication with the outside world has been intermittent.Energoatom said Friday that Russian shelling had hit in and around the nuclear complex and damaged a water intake facility, cutting power and water to much of Enerhodar. \"Three hits were recorded directly at the site of the station,\" the Ukrainian agency said, claiming that one was \"near one of the power units where the nuclear reactor is located.\"CNN was unable to verify claims of damage at the plant, which occupies a large site. Much of the recent Russian fire in the area has originated from near the plant and it is unclear if parts of the nuclear facility were hit accidentally. Energoatom said on Saturday that the plant was operational and Ukrainian staff at the station continued to work to ensure radiation safety.Ukrainian prosecutors have opened an investigation into the incident.Zaporizhzhia plant 'out of control'The exact danger posed by the blasts in and around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant remains unclear. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, said in an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday that the situation at the plant was \"completely out of control.\" \"Every principle of nuclear safety has been violated,\" he said, calling on Russia and Ukraine to allow experts to visit the site. \"What is at stake is extremely serious and extremely grave and dangerous.\"Other officials have been more measured, pointing to the fact that recent nuclear energy facilities are designed to withstand terrorist attacks and natural disasters.Several Western and Ukrainian officials believe that Russia is now using the giant nuclear facility as a fortress to protect their troops and stage attacks, because they assume Kyiv will not retaliate and risk a crisis.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday accused Moscow of using the plant to shield its forces, and Ukraine has warned that shelling at the complex could be disastrous. \"The possible consequences of hitting an operating reactor are equivalent to the use of an atomic bomb,\" Ukraine's foreign ministry said Friday on Twitter.The United Kingdom has said that the actions at the complex have undermined the safety of the plant's operations.\"Russian forces have probably used the wider facility area, in particular the adjacent city of Enerhodar, to rest their forces, utilizing the protected status of the nuclear power plant to reduce the risk to their equipment and personnel from overnight Ukrainian attacks,\" Britain's ministry of defense said Friday in an intelligence update on Twitter.The Ukrainian mayor of Enerhodar, Dmytro Orlov, said in late July that Russian forces had been observed using heavy weaponry near the plant because \"they know very well that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will not respond to these attacks, as they can damage the nuclear power plant.\"\n\nCNN's Joshua Berlinger, Lauren Kent, Yulia Kesaieva and Petro Zadorozhnny contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "edition.cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vasco_cotovio@edition.cnn.com", "name": "Vasco Cotovio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "tim_lister@edition.cnn.com", "name": "Tim Lister", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220806023306-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-file-super-tease.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7916201", "sentiment": -0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 14, "stanza_neu": 16, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 30, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7142100529", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-06", "time": "14:24:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-06T14:24:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-06T14:24:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "url": "https://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2022/08/06/Ukraine-claims-serious-damage-to-nuclear-plant-in-military-strikes", "title": "Ukraine claims 'serious damage' to nuclear plant in military strikes  | Al Arabiya English", "body": "Parts of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant were \"seriously damaged\" by military strikes that forced one of its reactors to shut down, the plant's operator said on Saturday.\n\nThe Friday strikes on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in south Ukraine -- Europe's largest atomic power complex -- \"seriously damaged\" a station containing nitrogen and oxygen and an \"auxiliary building,\" Energoatom said on the Telegram messaging service.\n\nKyiv and Moscow blamed each other for the attacks.\n\nFor all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\nThe strikes had damaged a power cable, forced one of the reactors to stop working and \"there are still risks of leaking hydrogen and radioactive substances, and the risk of fire is also high,\" it said.\n\nThe shelling \"has caused a serious risk for the safe operation of the plant.\"\n\nRussian troops have occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant since the early days of their invasion and Kyiv has accused them of storing heavy weapons there.\n\nBut Moscow, in turn, has accused Ukrainian forces of targeting the plant.\n\nThe European Union hit out at Russia on Saturday over the shelling.\n\n\"The EU condemns Russia's military activities around #Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,\" the bloc's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"This is a serious and irresponsible breach of nuclear safety rules and another example of Russia's disregard for international norms.\"\n\nBorrell insisted that the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, be given access to the plant.\n\nThe IAEA has been trying for weeks to send a team to inspect the plant.

They called it an act of \"nuclear terrorism.\"\n\n\"Fortunately, the Ukrainian shells did not hit the oil and fuel facility and the oxygen plant nearby, thus avoiding a larger fire and a possible radiation accident,\" The Russian defense ministry said, according to Reuters.\n\nRisks of Fire Near One of the Reactors in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Complex\n\nAt approximately 2:30 p.m. on Friday, several explosions destroyed electrical transmission lines, which posed an immediate risk to the plant. Plant engineers were then forced to reduce power on one of the six nuclear reactors at the site.\n\nThree more explosions rocked an auxiliary building near one of the nuclear reactors a few hours later, raising the risk of hydrogen leaks and fire, Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom said.\n\nAt the time of the blasts, three of the reactors were operating, two were on standby, and one was undergoing planned maintenance and repairs, according to Ukrainian officials. Although the plant is occupied by Russian military forces, it is still run by Ukrainian nuclear engineers.\n\nEnergoatom said that after the first attack, there were no releases of radioactive materials recorded. However, after the second attack, where explosions damaged an auxiliary building and a specialized station, the company said that the danger of fire was high.\n\nThe UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it was aware of the reports and gathering further information about the situation.

This was confirmed by the UK Defense Ministry in its daily intelligence assessment. The UK said that Russian forces \"have likely undermined the security\" of the plant and were using the area to launch attacks on the west side of the Dnieper River - taking advantage of the \"protected status\" of the nuclear power plant to reduce the risk of overnight attacks from Ukrainian forces.\n\nEarlier this week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Moscow of using the plant as a \"nuclear shield\" by its troops at the site.

While the IAEA has some contacts with staff, they are \"faulty\" and \"patchy,\" he said.\n\nGrossi said the supply chain of equipment and spare parts has been interrupted, \"so we are not sure the plant is getting all it needs.\" The IAEA also needs to perform very important inspections to ensure that nuclear material is being safeguarded, \"and there is a lot of nuclear material there to be inspected,\" he said.\n\n\"When you put this together, you have a catalog of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility,\" Grossi said. \"And this is why I have been insisting from day one that we have to be able to go there to perform this safety and security evaluation, to do the repairs and to assist as we already did in Chernobyl.\"\n\nThe Russian capture of Zaporizhzhya renewed fears that the largest of Ukraine's 15 nuclear reactors could be damaged, setting off another emergency like the 1986 Chernobyl accident, the world's worst nuclear disaster, which happened about 110 kilometers (65 miles) north of the capital Kyiv.\n\nRussian forces occupied the heavily contaminated site soon after the invasion but handed control back to the Ukrainians at the end of March. Grossi visited Chernobyl on April 27 and tweeted that the level of safety was \"like a 'red light' blinking.\" But he said Tuesday that the IAEA set up \"an assistance mission\" at Chernobyl at that time \"that has been very, very successful so far.\"\n\nThe IAEA needs to go to Zaporizhzhya, as it did to Chernobyl, to ascertain the facts of what is actually happening there, to carry out repairs and inspections, and \"to prevent a nuclear accident from happening,\" Grossi said.\n\nThe IAEA chief said he and his team need protection to get to the plant and the urgent cooperation of Russia and Ukraine.\n\nEach side wants this international mission to go from different sites, which is understandable in light of territorial integrity and political considerations, he said, but there's something more urgent and that is getting the IAEA team to Zaporizhzhya.\n\n\"The IAEA, by its presence, will be a deterrent to any act of violence against this nuclear power plant,\" Grossi said. \"So I'm pleading as an international civil servant, as the head of an international organization, I'm pleading to both sides to let this mission proceed.\"\n\nGrossi was in New York to deliver a keynote speech at Monday's opening of the long-delayed high-level meeting to review the landmark 50-year-old Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and eventually achieving a nuclear-free world.\n\nIn the interview, the IAEA chief also spoke about efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major powers that the Trump administration abandoned in 2018 and the Biden administration has been working to renew.\n\nGrossi said there is \"an ongoing effort to try to go for yet another meeting or round to explore possibilities to come to an agreement.\" He said he heard the meeting \"could be soon.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the NPT review conference on Monday that Iran \"has either been unwilling or unable\" to accept a deal to return to the 2015 agreement aimed at reining in its nuclear program.\n\nGrossi said \"there are important differences among the negotiating parties\" and important verification issues related to past activities that Iran needs to address. \"It's not impossible, it's complex,\" he said.\n\nIf the nuclear agreement, known as the JCPOA, is not extended, he said some IAEA inspections will continue. But the JCPOA provides for additional transparency and inspections \"which I deem as extremely important, very necessary, because of the breadth and depth of the nuclear program in Iran,\" he said.\n\nGrossi stressed that cooperating with the IAEA, answering its questions, allowing its inspectors to go wherever they need to be, is essential for Iran to build trust and confidence. \"Promises and good words will not do,\" he said.\n\nOn another issue, Grossi said last September's deal in which the United States and Britain will provide Australia with nuclear reactors to power its submarines requires an agreement with the IAEA to ensure that the amount of nuclear material in the vessel when it leaves port is there when it returns.\n\nHe said Australia hasn't decided what type of vessel it will be getting, so while there have been preparatory talks, substantive talks can't begin.\n\nBecause it's a military vessel, Grossi said, \"there are lots of confidential and protection of information measures that need to be embedded into any such agreement, so it's very complex technologically.\"", "source": {"uri": "todayville.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Todayville"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@todayville.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.todayville.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tvrd-tvrd-ukraine-ambassador-canada-image-2022-08-04.jpg?fit=768%2C528&ssl=1&w=640", "eventUri": "eng-7916201", "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 23, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 33, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7142038225", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-06", "time": "13:06:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-06T13:06:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-06T13:06:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7411764860153198, "url": "https://www.spacewar.com/afp/220806123304.vazvzhnv.html", "title": "Ukraine says parts of nuclear plant 'seriously damaged' in strikes", "body": "The Friday strikes on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in south Ukraine -- Europe's largest atomic power complex -- \"seriously damaged\" a station containing nitrogen and oxygen and an \"auxiliary building,\" Energoatom said on the Telegram messaging service.\n\nKyiv and Moscow blamed each other for the attacks.\n\nThe strikes had damaged a power cable, forced one of the reactors to stop working and \"there are still risks of leaking hydrogen and radioactive substances, and the risk of fire is also high,\" it said.\n\nThe shelling \"has caused a serious risk for the safe operation of the plant.\"\n\nRussian troops have occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant since the early days of their invasion and Kyiv has accused them of storing heavy weapons there.\n\nBut Moscow, in turn, has accused Ukrainian forces of targeting the plant.\n\nThe European Union hit out at Russia on Saturday over the shelling.\n\n\"The EU condemns Russia's military activities around #Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,\" the bloc's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"This is a serious and irresponsible breach of nuclear safety rules and another example of Russia's disregard for international norms.\"\n\nBorrell insisted that the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, be given access to the plant.\n\nThe IAEA has been trying for weeks to send a team to inspect the plant.

Now it would appear that heavy use of the installation as an artillery firebase has put it in major danger.\n\nAccording to Reuters, during an August 1 news conference at the United Nations headquarters in New York City, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters that the actions being carried out by Russian forces at Zaporizhzhia in the southeastern city of Enerhodar are the \"the height of irresponsibility.\" This statement followed Blinken's accusation that the invading country had been using the plant as a military base to carry out artillery strikes on Ukrainian forces. Firing munitions like rockets, missiles, and mortars in close proximity to a nuclear power plant is already generally dangerous, but doing so from such a position also prevents Ukrainian forces from launching a counter-attack.\n\nHowever, Russia is adamantly denying these accusations. The Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations released a statement shortly after Blinken's news conference, saying that the actions of the Russian Armed Forces in no way undermine Ukraine's nuclear security or impede the routine operation of the plant. The statement goes on to assert that Zaporizhzhia is currently under Russian control but that its seizure took place with the sole purpose of \"preventing Ukrainian nationalist formations and foreign mercenaries from making use of the current situation in Ukraine in order to carry out a nuclear provocation with most unpredictable consequences.\"\n\n\"There are no armed formations at the Zaporozhye NPP [nuclear power plant], except for a limited number of military servicemen, that is required to ensure safety and security at the power plant,\" read the statement. \"Over the recent months, Ukrainian armed formations held a series of provocations that used UAVs (i.a. those delivered by NATO states) and aimed at sabotaging the normal operation of the NPP, frightening its personnel, undermining security of the power plant, and ultimately, creating a threat of a nuclear disaster.\"\n\nTo better understand the Ukrainian side of the issue, The War Zone reached out to Olena Pareniuk, senior researcher for Ukraine's Institute for Safety Problems of Nuclear Power Plants, who provided valuable insight into the current environment at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear site. Pareniuk has spent several years of her career studying and investigating the aftermath of nuclear disasters including the fallout from both the 1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant explosion and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant tragedy in 2011. You can read more about her experiences and thoughts on the dangers posed to Ukraine's nuclear infrastructure due to Russia's invasion in this past War Zone piece here.\n\n\"The situation is definitely not normal,\" wrote Pareniuk in her response to The War Zone. \"But the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] refuses to do anything but claim their concerns. And moreover, they insist on a visit to Zaporizhzhya NPP that will let Russia legitimize its presence on the NPP. Ukraine will keep refusing the IAEA mission to ZNPP until it is back under our control.\"\n\nIt is important to note that during the news conference Blinken also asserted his belief that the IAEA should be given access to the plant, and IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi noted that not doing so would be an example of unconscionable inaction. Pareniuk's perspective on the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant only continued to deviate from the Russian Federation's statement denying Blinken's accusations. She says the Russian military equipment located at the plant is a major threat.\n\n\"There are at least 14 military vehicles/armor and explosives inside the engine hall of the NPP, very close to the reactor,\" Pareniuk wrote. \"More than 100 [NPP] personnel were kidnapped and tortured, five are still missing. If it explodes, it can cause severe damage to the reactor and might cause a leak of radioactivity.\"\n\nThis sentiment was further echoed by Grossi in an interview with the Associated Press where the IAEA director told the outlet that \"every principle of nuclear safety has been violated\" and that \"what is at stake is extremely serious and extremely grave and dangerous.\"\n\nBoth Grossi and the IAEA as a whole have implored Russia and Ukraine to urgently grant nuclear experts access to the plant in order to attempt to stabilize the situation as much as possible before it is too late. Beyond that, Grossi noted that \"patchy\" contacts between the IAEA and the Zaporizhzhia plant, interruption in the supply chain of equipment and spare parts, and a lack of regularly scheduled routine inspections have also contributed to the precarity unfolding at the plant.\n\nAt this point, an IAEA visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant would require the cooperation of both Ukrainian and Russian forces for the sake of global safety. Both the IAEA and the UN treat the controlled and regulated operation of nuclear power plants as a non-political issue, but the warring countries would have to put aside their hostilities in order to make such a concession.\n\n\"If an accident occurs at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, we will not have a natural disaster to blame - we will have only ourselves to answer to,\" said Rossi at the UN conference. \"We need everyone's support.\"\n\nContact the author: Emma@thewarzone.com\n\nMORE TO READ\n\nRelated\n\n20 Percent Of The USAF's B-2 Force Is Deployed 'Down Under'The B-2 deployment to Australia comes as the USAF ramps up its presence in the Indo-Pacific region amid growing tensions with China.

In an interview with the Associated Press, Rafael Grossi said Tuesday, quote, 'Every principle of nuclear safety has been violated [at the plant]. ... What is at stake is extremely serious and extremely grave and dangerous.'\n\nIn recent weeks, the Russian military has deployed heavy artillery batteries and laid anti-personnel landmines at the plant. Ukrainian officials say Russia is using the nuclear plant as a base for its artillery, knowing that Ukraine cannot attack a nuclear power plant without risking a nuclear disaster. Zaporizhzhia is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe.\n\nWe begin today's show with Shaun Burnie, senior nuclear specialist with Greenpeace, who has just returned from Ukraine, where he was conducting an investigation at Chernobyl, the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster. Russian forces occupied Chernobyl for a month immediately after the invasion of Ukraine began in February.\n\nShaun Burnie, welcome back to Democracy Now! Can you talk about the situation at Zaporizhzhia and what you found at Chernobyl?\n\nSHAUN BURNIE:\n\nWell, thank you.\n\nThe situation at Zaporizhzhia, it's unusual for Greenpeace to agree with the International Atomic Energy Agency, but Mr. Grossi is absolutely right to be deeply concerned. The occupation began on the 4th of March. And since then, hundreds of Russian forces, as well as state employees of the Russian nuclear state company, Rosatom, have been on the site. So that's bad enough.\n\nThe fighting around the plant, if anything, is more serious in terms of what's actually going on at the site itself, because nuclear power plants are dependent upon reliable offsite power, and already we saw, in March and April, the loss of so-called grid connection. These are incredibly important, because nuclear plants also require electricity to maintain operations, to maintain the facilities -- for example, the cooling pumps that pump water into the reactors and keep the reactors relatively safe. And what we saw in March and April was a loss of grid in a number of grid lines, and the reason for that was because of fighting 50, 60, 80 kilometers from the actual site. So, even if nothing happens at the site itself, nuclear plants are extremely vulnerable to external attack in the context of a war zone. And that's exactly what we are in the situation at the moment in southern Ukraine.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH:\n\nAnd, Shaun, you've said that the situation, of course, is extremely high risk in Zaporizhzhia, but you've also suggested that the role of the International Atomic Agency is highly political. Could you explain why?\n\nSHAUN BURNIE:\n\nIt's a really complicated situation. This is a nuclear plant in Ukraine, obviously, but it's under Russian military control, with the Russian nuclear state agency, Rosatom, on site. And the IAEA and Mr. Grossi have been trying to get access for a number of months. The problem is, if you, as an IAEA, go to Zaporizhzhia, are you therefore getting the approval of the Russian state, the Russian government, to access a nuclear facility in another country that actually still is a sovereign nation and for which the Zaporizhzhia plant still belongs? So there's lots of behind-the-scenes tensions in terms of whether the Russian state has any right to say to the IAEA, 'Yes, you can come and visit us.' So, the politics of this are really complicated.\n\nIt's not really clear to us what safety role the IAEA would play. We have Ukrainian nuclear employees working on the site. We have Russian military, and we have Russian state nuclear agency people. So, what role does the IAEA play in that? It has a safeguards function, which is to ensure that nuclear material is not diverted for military purposes, but there's absolutely no evidence that any nuclear material on the Zaporizhzhia site will be diverted by the Ukrainian government at this stage. That's clearly ridiculous. And the Russians, they've got so many nuclear weapons and nuclear material in their own country, they don't need to divert from Zaporizhzhia. So, it's not really clear what is going on with regards the IAEA's ambition to go there. I think, in part, it's also driven by Mr. Grossi's personal ambition. He seems to want to be seen as the savior of everything. And actually, the situation is a lot more serious than the individual ego of any one particular individual at a U.N. agency.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH:\n\nShaun, we'll turn in a second to your report, the Greenpeace report, the investigation into the Chernobyl plant, which Russian forces occupied during their invasion for over a month in the early days. But could you talk about what your concerns are with respect to Zaporizhzhia, people saying that it could actually -- if the plant is damaged, the situation could be worse than what happened at Chernobyl?\n\nSHAUN BURNIE:\n\nWell, clearly, it's an intolerable situation that Russian military, Russian nuclear state employees are occupying Ukraine's nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia. For the workers, for their families, whose job it is to try and maintain the safe operation of those reactors, that's clearly an outrageous situation, and it must be terminated and ended as soon as possible. The only way that can happen is for the Russians to withdraw immediately. Again, that's not going to happen.\n\nSo, what sort of scenarios are the most severe? The loss of cooling function to the reactor cores -- there's three reactors out of six that are currently operating -- that would be a major problem. We know that the generators that provide emergency power at Zaporizhzhia have got long-standing problems, not particularly reliable. The battery power is also extremely limited. So, loss of power is really the most severe issue that concerns us.\n\nAlso at the site, there are thousands of tons of spent fuel. That's the highly radioactive fuel that comes out of the reactors. Much of that is in dry stores, which are of less concern. But the material that's in the pools -- that's the swimming pools that are inside the reactor buildings -- they need to be constantly cooled, which means that in the Zaporizhzhia site you've got much more radioactivity than was ever released by Chernobyl, in a war zone, where the personnel are under direct military threat at all times. So the ability to respond to any event, particularly a more severe event like loss of cooling, is extremely compromised. So, at that point, you're looking at potential massive releases of radioactivity, potentially even greater than Chernobyl. That's not scaremongering; that's just the reality of having nuclear power plants in a war zone.\n\nAMY GOODMAN:\n\nAnd on the issue of Chernobyl, talk more extensively about what you found in your report, that says that the damage at Chernobyl, as you said, is so much worse than we understood.\n\nSHAUN BURNIE:\n\nSo, for a number of months, we've been in discussion with the Ukrainian government, and we had the opportunity, a unique opportunity, to actually conduct a survey, a radiation survey, and also to meet with scientists whose responsibility is to manage and oversee this enormous exclusion zone around the nuclear plant from 1986, still highly complex, highly radioactive, with many, many problems.\n\nAnd then the Russians occupied on the 24th of February, left on the 30th of March. And the reports coming out at that time seemed to be confused, and so we basically went in there to, A, listen and hear from the scientists who experienced the occupation -- and these are laboratories that are fulfilling vital safety work on radiation moving through the environment. This is an ongoing disaster site. And we clearly saw that the Russian military had damaged, destroyed parts of the laboratory, stolen databases, smashed computers, removed hard drives.\n\nBut then we also went into the area which they managed. It's 2,600 square kilometers. And we were only able to go to one very small specific area, because, unfortunately, the Russian military have also decided to place landmines throughout the territory, some of it organized and some of it completely chaotic, tripwires, anti-personnel mines. So, the impact on the scientists whose job it is to monitor radioactivity in the Chernobyl zone, also to provide warnings to firefighters, all of that has been compromised by the Russian military occupation. What we found was that radioactivity levels, in particular one area where the Russian military were, yes, it was high, but if you moved only 500 meters away, it was many, many times higher.\n\nAnd so, the idea that this is a situation under control, that the radiation levels are normal -- which is what the IAEA and Mr. Grossi communicated in April -- is clearly not true. And so, the situation is incredibly complex. And basically, turning this into soundbites saying that things are normal, it doesn't give any information whatsoever. So we have some severe doubts about the accuracy of what the IAEA was trying to communicate back in April. This is an ongoing crisis at the Chernobyl site. The workers, the scientists, the state agency, they need as much help as possible, because this is of national and international significance, in terms of what radioactivity is doing to the environment there and what it potentially poses as further threats in the future.\n\nAMY GOODMAN:\n\nShaun Burnie of Greenpeace, I wanted to bring in Dr. Ira Helfand, the immediate past president of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, which won the Nobel Peace Prize, also co-founder and past president of Physicians for Social Responsibility and serves on the international steering group of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapon, which also won the Nobel Peace Prize. Dr. Helfand, as you listen to this report, Shaun Burnie just back from Ukraine, both about what's happening at Zaporizhzhia, where the Russians are basing themselves there so the Ukrainians cannot attack because that would create a nuclear catastrophe, and his findings at Chernobyl, your response?\n\nDR. IRA HELFAND:\n\nWell, you know, clearly, the situation around the nuclear reactors in Ukraine is extremely worrisome and it underlines, as Shaun was saying, the fact that these reactors are not designed to function in a war zone. And it calls into question, I think, the entire nuclear power enterprise globally, because we just can't afford to run the risk of this kind of catastrophic accident occurring, with the enormous public health implications that would follow from that. Tens of thousands of people were exposed to doses of radiation from Chernobyl that led to them developing cancer and dying. The exact number is very difficult to come by, but the estimates are that it's at least in the tens of thousands, and perhaps higher. And we can't afford to continue to operate these nuclear reactors, given those kinds of risks.\n\nAMY GOODMAN:\n\nWell, we want to thank Shaun Burnie for being with us, Shaun Burnie of Greenpeace, who's just back right now from Ukraine, where he investigated what took place at Chernobyl and is talking about the situation at Zaporizhzhia. And we'll link to your Greenpeace report, 'Investigation Inside the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone.' Dr. Helfand, we'd like you to stay with us as we talk further about the threat of nuclear war.

Dr. Helfand, as you listen to this report, Shaun Burnie just back from Ukraine, both about what's happening at Zaporizhzhia, where the Russians are basing themselves there so the Ukrainians cannot attack because that would create a nuclear catastrophe, and his findings at Chernobyl, your response?\n\nDR. IRA HELFAND: Well, you know, clearly, the situation around the nuclear reactors in Ukraine is extremely worrisome and it underlines, as Shaun was saying, the fact that these reactors are not designed to function in a war zone. And it calls into question, I think, the entire nuclear power enterprise globally, because we just can't afford to run the risk of this kind of catastrophic accident occurring, with the enormous public health implications that would follow from that. Tens of thousands of people were exposed to doses of radiation from Chernobyl that led to them developing cancer and dying. The exact number is very difficult to come by, but the estimates are that it's at least in the tens of thousands, and perhaps higher. And we can't afford to continue to operate these nuclear reactors, given those kinds of risks.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, we want to thank Shaun Burnie for being with us, Shaun Burnie of Greenpeace, who's just back right now from Ukraine, where he investigated what took place at Chernobyl and is talking about the situation at Zaporizhzhia. And we'll link to your Greenpeace report, \"Investigation Inside the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone.\" Dr. Helfand, we'd like you to stay with us as we talk further about the threat of nuclear war.

There are concerns that a Chernobyl-like disaster could take place at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is the largest of its type in Europe, after the Russians took control of the site in March. While it remains operational, experts have said they are worried about the condition of its 15 nuclear reactors, especially after shots were fired in its direction during the Russian advance. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has now said occupying forces have 'undermined the security and safety' of the power plant, and has claimed Putin's army is using the power plant as a shield.\n\nRussia and Ukraine on Friday accused each other of shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the biggest of its kind in Europe, and laying the ground for a potential disaster. Russia's defence ministry said it was only by luck that a radiation accident had been avoided after what it described as an artillery barrage. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy though said Moscow was responsible and accused it of committing \"an open, brazen crime, an act of terror\".\n\nReuters 5th Aug 2022 read more \"\n\nGreenpeace Warns of Twin Nuclear Crises in Ukraine from Chernobyl to Russian Military Control of Zaporizhzhia Plant. Safety conditions at Ukraine's Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant are \"completely out of control,\" according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. This comes as the Russian military has deployed heavy artillery batteries and laid anti-personnel landmines at the site in recent weeks. \"Nuclear plants are extremely vulnerable to external attack in the context of a war zone,\" says Shaun Burnie, senior nuclear specialist with Greenpeace, who says something as simple as the loss of power could unleash \"massive releases of radioactivity\" at rates worse than the Cheronobyl disaster of 1986. The situation at Zaporizhzhia, it's unusual for Greenpeace to agree with the International Atomic Energy Agency, but Mr. Grossi is absolutely right to be deeply concerned. The occupation began on the 4th of March. And since then, hundreds of Russian forces, as well as state employees of the Russian nuclear state company, Rosatom, have been on the site. So that's bad enough. The fighting around the plant, if anything, is more serious in terms of what's actually going on at the site itself, because nuclear power plants are dependent upon reliable offsite power, and already we saw, in March and April, the loss of so-called grid connection. These are incredibly important, because nuclear plants also require electricity to maintain operations, to maintain the facilities -- for example, the cooling pumps that pump water into the reactors and keep the reactors relatively safe. And what we saw in March and April was a loss of grid in a number of grid lines, and the reason for that was because of fighting 50, 60, 80 kilometers from the actual site. So, even if nothing happens at the site itself, nuclear plants are extremely vulnerable to external attack in the context of a war zone. And that's exactly what we are in the situation at the moment in southern Ukraine.\n\nDemocracy Now 4th Aug 2022 read more \"\n\nMoscow on Friday accused Kyiv of shelling a nuclear power station under its control, renewing safety fears over Europe's largest plant.

Europe's biggest nuclear facility as a fortress\n\nExperts say that Ukraine's occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant -- Europe's biggest -- is \"extremely vulnerable\" to meltdown after the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said all safety measures had been \"violated\" by Russian forces.\n\nIf the plant loses grid power due to a potential uptick of fighting in the area, backup generators and batteries are still insufficient to cool, not only the six reactors, but large pools of highly radioactive spent fuel, said Shaun Burnie, nuclear specialist with Greenpeace East Asia.\n\nAdding to these concerns is news that Russian forces are using Zaporizhzhia as a weapons depot and a cover for launching attacks. US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, said that Russia was using the nuclear site as the \"equivalent of a human shield\" at a UN meeting on nuclear non-proliferation this week.\n\nUsing the plant in this way violates the Geneva Convention, which states that particular care must be taken if \"installations containing dangerous forces\" are located near fighting. Around 500 Russian troops are reported to be currently located at the site.\n\nWhen fighting first broke out in the vicinity of the plant in early March, it was the first time in the atomic age that war had come so close to a major facility.\n\nOnce Russian forces occupied the power plant in mid-March and allowed Ukrainian staff to carry on their work, news from Zaporizhzhia, which currently operates three of its reactors, had been intermittent.\n\nNow, however, concern is mounting again that the plant is not being sufficiently maintained.\n\n\"[It is a] violation of every possible nuclear safety measure that you can imagine,\" said Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in an interview with DW on Friday.\n\n\"Is it true that there is explosives and other material stocked near the reactors?\" he asked of reports that missiles and other weapons could be launched from the site, with counter-attack impossible due to the extreme threat of an accident.\n\nGrossi of the IAEA is also concerned that the Ukrainian staff who are under the command of the Russian occupiers at Zaporizhzhia are unable to properly carry out their duties and have faced threats of violence.\n\n\"I have been trying to put together a technical mission led by myself to go there to address a number of issues,\" he told DW. But access will be impossible without the accompaniment of UN peacekeepers, he said, a situation he is discussing with UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres.\n\nIn an interview with AP published Tuesday, Grossi said the atomic energy agency has only \"patchy\" contact with staff at the site. He was also concerned that necessary equipment, including spare parts for maintenance of the reactors, was not being delivered due to interrupted supply chains.\n\n\"We are not sure the plant is getting all it needs,\" he said, adding that the situation is \"completely out of control.\"\n\nGreenpeace's Shaun Burnie agrees that it is vital that trained local staff maintain their positions and can work safely at the nuclear site. While Russia has more than twice as many reactors as Ukraine, most are older models, meaning their engineers don't have the expertise to run the newer technology in Zaporizhzhia, he said.\n\nLocal staff will also be needed in the event of the regular flooding from the Dnieper River, which flows through the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant and could damage the dams and reservoirs that provide the cooling water for the reactors.\n\nPetro Kotin, head of Ukraine's state-run nuclear power plant operator Energoatom, last week accused Russia of abducting up to 100 employees from Zaporizhzhia.\n\n\"Only some of these people then return to work with a broken psyche, making a statement that they love the Russian world because of the tortures that are applied to them by the invaders,\" Kotin said.\n\nBurnie is doubly concerned after a recent visit to the formerly Russian-occupied Chernobyl nuclear plant, site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986.\n\nThere his team discovered a contaminated exclusion zone riddled with mines -- which stopped effective monitoring of the area. He said he also discovered vital monitoring equipment in Chernobyl that Russian forces has destroyed, damaged or stolen.\n\nUN nuclear director Grossi has been calling for the liberation of the plant from the Russian \"invaders,\" saying that Russian president Vladimir Putin is engaging in \"nuclear terrorism.\"", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.dw.com/image/62689549_6.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7916201", "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 15, "stanza_neu": 11, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 27, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7141882908", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-06", "time": "09:46:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-06T09:46:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-06T09:39:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7215686440467834, "url": "https://www.rt.com/russia/560352-ukraine-nuclear-plant-shelling/", "title": "Ukraine risks repeating Chernobyl disaster, Russia warns  --  RT Russia & Former Soviet Union", "body": "Russia has urged the UN and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to make Ukraine stop the \"shelling\" of Europe's largest nuclear power plant.\n\nMoscow accused Ukrainian troops of firing artillery shells at the Zaporozhskaya Nuclear Power Plant in the country's southern Zaporozhye Region on Friday.\n\nThe plant was seized by Russian forces in late February, when Moscow launched its military campaign in the neighboring country.

US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, said that Russia was using the nuclear site as the \"equivalent of a human shield\" atUN meetingon nuclear non-proliferation this week.\n\nUsing the plant in this way violates the Geneva Convention, which states that particular care must be taken if \"installations containing dangerous forces\" are located near fighting. Around 500 Russian troops are reported to currently located at the site.\n\nWhen fighting first broke out in the vicinity of the plant in early March, it was the first time in the atomic age that war had come so close to a major facility.\n\nOnce Russian forces occupied the power plant in mid-March and allowed Ukrainian staff to carry on their work, news from Zaporizhzhia, which currently operates three of its reactors, had been intermittent.\n\nNuclear safety 'violated' by Russian occupiers\n\nNow, however, concern is mounting again that the plant is not being sufficiently maintained.\n\n\"[It is a] violation of every possible nuclear safety measure that you can imagine,\" said Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in an interview with DW on Friday.\n\n\"Is it true that there is explosives and other material stocked near the reactors?\" he asked of reports that missiles and other weapons could be launched from the site, with counter-attack impossible due to the extreme threat of an accident.\n\nGrossi of the IAEA is also concerned that the Ukrainian staff who are under the command of the Russian occupiers at Zaporizhzhia are unable to properly carry out their duties and have faced threats of violence.\n\n\"I have been trying to put together a technical mission led by myself to go there to address a number of issues,\" he told DW. But access will be impossible without the accompaniment of UN peacekeepers, he said, a situation he is discussing with US Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres.\n\nIn an interview with AP published Tuesday, Grossi said the atomic energy agency has only \"patchy\" contact with staff at the site. He was also concerned that necessary equipment, including spare parts for maintenance of the reactors, was not being delivered due to interrupted supply chains.\n\n\"We are not sure the plant is getting all it needs,\" he said, adding that the situation is \"completely out of control.\"\n\nPlant still 'extremely vulnerable'\n\nGreenpeace's Shaun Burnie agrees that it is vital that trained local staff maintain their positions and can work safely at the nuclear site. While Russia has more than twice as many reactors as Ukraine, most are older models, meaning their engineers don't have the expertise to run the newer technology in Zaporizhzhia, he said.\n\nLocal staff will also be needed in the event of the regular flooding from the Dnieper River, which flows through the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant and could damage the dams and reservoirs that provide the cooling water for the reactors.\n\nPetro Kotin, head of Ukraine's state-run nuclear power plant operator Energoatom, last week accused Russia of abducting up to 100 employees from Zaporizhzhia.\n\n\"Only some of these people then return to work with a broken psyche, making a statement that they love the Russian world because of the tortures that are applied to them by the invaders,\" Kotin said.\n\nBurnie is doubly concerned after a recent visit to the formerly Russian-occupied Chernobyl nuclear plant, site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986.\n\nThere his team discovered a contaminated exclusion zone riddled with mines -- which stopped effective monitoring of the area. He said he also discovered vital monitoring equipment in Chernobyl that Russian forces has destroyed, damaged or stolen.\n\nUN nuclear director Grossi has been calling for the liberation of the plant from the Russian \"invaders,\" saying that Russian president Vladimir Putin is engaging in \"nuclear terrorism.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyfinland.fi", "dataType": "news", "title": "clickittefaq"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.dailyfinland.fi/assets/news_photos/2022/08/03/image-28389.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7916201", "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 16, "stanza_neu": 11, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 28, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7139294065", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-04", "time": "08:28:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-04T08:28:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-04T08:05:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "url": "https://english.alaraby.co.uk/news/iaea-head-appeals-access-ukraine-nuclear-plant", "title": "IAEA head appeals for access to Ukraine nuclear plant", "body": "Rafael Grossi is the head of the UN's IAEA nuclear watchdog [Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket/Getty-archive]\n\nThe head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog appealed for access to a Ukrainian nuclear power plant now controlled by Russian forces to determine whether it was a source of danger.\n\nContact with the Europe's largest nuclear plant, which is at Zaporizhzhia and is being operated by Ukrainian technicians, was \"fragile\" and communications did not function every day, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi told Swiss paper Tages-Anzeiger.\n\n\"We can't afford faulty communication with the plant in areas relevant to safety.

On Saturday it fired a volley of Grad rockets that damaged 11 apartment buildings and 36 privately owned houses, and wounded three people, the Ukrainian military said.\n\nThe assault also knocked out electricity, water and natural gas supplies in the town, where residents have been fleeing from the artillery attacks and attendant risk of radiation, the Ukrainian military said.\n\nRussian forces began staging artillery attacks from the plant about a month ago, and the Ukrainian military has said it cannot shoot back because of concerns that it would hit a reactor at the plant, igniting a radiation catastrophe.\n\nUkraine has also accused the Russians of setting off explosions at the plant intended to unnerve European allies about nuclear safety and discourage arming Ukraine.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant occupies a perilous spot on the broad Dnipro River, along the frontline of the war between Russia and Ukraine. The Ukrainian Army controls the west bank, while the Russians are entrenched around the plant on the river's east bank.\n\nThe battles near the nuclear plant came as clashes continued elsewhere in Ukraine, including Russian artillery and tank assaults on the eastern town of Bakhmut, the site of some of the fiercest fighting along the front in recent days.\n\nThe Ukrainian military continued striking targets far behind Russia's front lines, hoping to whittle away at ammunition and fuel supplies. American-provided HIMARS rockets have helped shift the tide in the war, and on Friday Ukraine hit three command posts and six ammunition depots at various positions behind enemy lines along the front, it said in a statement.\n\nOutrage over nuclear safety violations -- Rafael Grossi, the head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, said on Tuesday that \"every principle of nuclear safety has been violated\" -- has done nothing to dislodge the Russian army from the site, and fighting has continued daily, with explosions in the early afternoon on Friday. Mr. Grossi called conditions at the plant \"out of control.\"\n\nMr. Grossi said he was far more worried about Zaporizhzhia than he was about Chernobyl, the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster, also in Ukraine, that radiated the surrounding area and imperiled Europe.\n\n\"Chernobyl, I think we are fine,'' said Mr. Grossi, noting that his agency had inspected the plant regularly and had restored sensors for radiation monitoring and other detection devices.\n\nBut the I.A.E.A. has been unable to access key parts of the reactors at Zaporizhzhia, as the occupying Russian force and surrounding shelling make it too dangerous for inspectors. That raises the prospect that if damage is done to the facility, it may be difficult, at best, to assess the danger, he added.\n\nOur Coverage of the Russia-Ukraine WarOn the Ground: As Russian troops appear to be preparing for new attacks in Ukraine's east and south, Western officials say Russia's critical manpower and equipment shortfalls could give Ukraine's counteroffensive a better chance to succeed.Nuclear Shelter: The Russian military is using \u0430 nuclear power station in southern Ukraine as a fortress, stymying Ukrainian forces and unnerving locals, who fear shelling and a radiation leak.Refugees in Europe: The flow of people fleeing Ukraine has increased pressure across the region. Some c\u043euntries are paying shipping firms to offer new arrivals safe but tight quarters.Prison Camp Explosion: After a blast at a Russian detention camp killed at least 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war, Ukrainian officials said that they were building a case of a war crime committed by Russian forces.\n\nIn a statement issued on Saturday, the Ukrainian state nuclear company, Enerhoatam, said Russian soldiers have occupied basements at the plant and are preventing employees from sheltering in them, despite the risks from combat in the area. \"People do not have shelter and are in danger,\" the statement said.\n\nBlocking access to the shelters comes atop other psychological stresses for Ukrainian workers on the reactor control room and other plant employees, who have been subjected to harsh interrogations including torture with electrical shocks, according to Ukrainian officials. The tension poses risks of accidents by human error, the officials have said.\n\nThe blasts on Friday destroyed high-voltage electrical wires, forcing the Ukrainian workers to reduce output at one of the plant's six reactors. Two others had already been idled and a third was undergoing routine maintenance.\n\nLater in the day, a second series of explosions damaged a building on the plant's premises, according to Ukraine's state nuclear power company. The company said Russia staged the blasts; Russia's military said the attacks came from the Ukrainian side.\n\nIn his nightly address to Ukrainians, President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday highlighted what he called the \"brazen crime\" of the Russian military using the nuclear power plant as cover.\n\n\"The occupiers created another extremely risky situation for everyone in Europe,\" Mr. Zelensky said, citing the explosions earlier in the day at the plant. \"This is the largest nuclear power plant on our continent. And any shelling of this facility is an open, brazen crime, an act of terror.\"\n\nAn adviser to Mr. Zelensky, Mykhailo Podolyak, addressed the risk even more bluntly in a post on Twitter on Saturday, suggesting a disaster sending radiation wafting over Europe might occur any day.\n\n\"This morning in Europe became possible just because the Zaporizhzhia NPP miraculously did not explode yesterday,\" he wrote, using shorthand for nuclear power plant. He suggested that the United Nations should negotiate a Russian withdrawal from the plant that would put the site under control of an independent \"special commission.\"\n\nWestern nations have imposed heavy sanctions on Russia for its war on Ukraine, and Mr. Zelensky called on them to extend those to Russia's state nuclear power company, Rosatom. The company has signed contracts with dozens of countries around the world, including China, India, Turkey and Finland, to design and build nuclear power stations\n\n\"This is purely a matter of safety,\" Mr. Zelensky said. \"The one who creates nuclear threats to other nations is definitely not capable of using nuclear technologies safely.\"\n\nMr. Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Tuesday that the war in Ukraine was \"threatening one of the world's biggest nuclear power programs,\" noting multiple safety violations at the Zaporizhzhia plant and describing the situation as \"out of control.\"\n\n\"Inaction is unconscionable,\" he said. \"If an accident occurs at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, we will not have a natural disaster to blame. We will have only ourselves to answer to.\"\n\nBasing military equipment at the plant gives Russia a tactical advantage, Ukrainian army commanders and civilian officials say.\n\nRussia has parked an armored personnel carrier and trucks in a machine room of reactor No. 1, according to Dmytro Orlov, the mayor of Enerhodar, the town that is home to the nuclear plant.\n\nRussia puts rocket artillery launchers between reactor buildings, Mr. Orlov said. Ukraine's military intelligence agency claimed to have hit one with a drone munition in July.\n\nRussia's use of the site for military purposes is also intended to signal the danger of continuing Western policies of arming Ukraine, Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council said in a statement.\n\nThe council's Center for Counteracting Disinformation identified the aim as increasing \"fear in Europe of the possibility of a nuclear catastrophe and reduce the desire of Western countries to provide military assistance.\"\n\nDavid E.

Foto: Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images\n\nExperts previously told Insider that the risk for a major disaster at the plant is low, but throwing active conflict into the mix raises the potential for an accident.\n\nDespite making some limited attempts to gain control over the plant, Ukrainian forces have so far been reluctant to strike the occupying Russian troops because they fear an attack might jeopardize the safety of the nuclear reactors.\n\n\"How can we respond?\" Ukraine's Col.

More than five months into the war, the stronger-than-anticipated Ukrainian defense has forced fighting to be concentrated in Eastern Ukraine, which is home to Europe's largest nuclear facility, the Zaporizhzhia NPP.\n\nConcerns the Russian military may cause damage to the plant, therefore raising the risk of a nuclear crisis, have been ongoing since March, when Moscow's troops seized the plant and shelling began. These concerns were renewed Friday when troops allegedly opened fire at the plant again.\n\nThe Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement Friday condemning the alleged shooting, warning that any action taken against the plant could have potentially devastating effects.\n\n\"The possible consequences of hitting an operating reactor are equivalent to the use of an atomic bomb,\" the ministry wrote, adding that Russia moved military trucks and SUVs filled with weapons to the plant earlier this month.\n\nThe alleged shelling caused damage to the plant's high-voltage supply line, the statement said.

US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, said that Russia was using the nuclear site as the \"equivalent of a human shield\" at a UN meeting on nuclear non-proliferation this week.\n\nUsing the plant in this way violates the Geneva Convention, which states that particular care must be taken if \"installations containing dangerous forces\" are located near fighting. Around 500 Russian troops are reported to be currently located at the site.\n\nWhen fighting first broke out in the vicinity of the plant in early March, it was the first time in the atomic age that war had come so close to a major facility.\n\nOnce Russian forces occupied the power plant in mid-March and allowed Ukrainian staff to carry on their work, news from Zaporizhzhia, which currently operates three of its reactors, had been intermittent.\n\nNuclear safety 'violated' by Russian occupiers\n\nNow, however, concern is mounting again that the plant is not being sufficiently maintained.\n\n\"[It is a] violation of every possible nuclear safety measure that you can imagine,\" said Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in an interview with DW on Friday.\n\n\"Is it true that there is explosives and other material stocked near the reactors?\" he asked of reports that missiles and other weapons could be launched from the site, with counter-attack impossible due to the extreme threat of an accident.\n\nGrossi of the IAEA is also concerned that the Ukrainian staff who are under the command of the Russian occupiers at Zaporizhzhia are unable to properly carry out their duties and have faced threats of violence.\n\n\"I have been trying to put together a technical mission led by myself to go there to address a number of issues,\" he told DW. But access will be impossible without the accompaniment of UN peacekeepers, he said, a situation he is discussing with UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres.\n\nIn an interview with AP published Tuesday, Grossi said the atomic energy agency has only \"patchy\" contact with staff at the site. He was also concerned that necessary equipment, including spare parts for maintenance of the reactors, was not being delivered due to interrupted supply chains.\n\n\"We are not sure the plant is getting all it needs,\" he said, adding that the situation is \"completely out of control.\"\n\nPlant still 'extremely vulnerable'\n\nGreenpeace's Shaun Burnie agrees that it is vital that trained local staff maintain their positions and can work safely at the nuclear site. While Russia has more than twice as many reactors as Ukraine, most are older models, meaning their engineers don't have the expertise to run the newer technology in Zaporizhzhia, he said.\n\nLocal staff will also be needed in the event of the regular flooding from the Dnieper River, which flows through the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant and could damage the dams and reservoirs that provide the cooling water for the reactors.\n\nPetro Kotin, head of Ukraine's state-run nuclear power plant operator Energoatom, last week accused Russia of abducting up to 100 employees from Zaporizhzhia.\n\n\"Only some of these people then return to work with a broken psyche, making a statement that they love the Russian world because of the tortures that are applied to them by the invaders,\" Kotin said.\n\nBurnie is doubly concerned after a recent visit to survey the formerly Russian army-occupied Chernobyl nuclear plant, site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986.\n\nThere his team discovered a contaminated exclusion zone riddled with landmines -- which stopped effective monitoring of the area. In addition, vital monitoring equipment in the Chernobyl plant had been destroyed, damaged or stolen during the Russian military occupation.\n\nMeanwhile, Energoatom's Petro Kotin has been calling for the liberation of the Zaporizhzhia plant from the Russian \"invaders,\" saying that Russian president Vladimir Putin is engaging in \"nuclear terrorism.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://assets.telegraphindia.com/telegraph/2022/Aug/1659679679_ukraine.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7916201", "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 15, "stanza_neu": 11, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 27, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7140801967", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-05", "time": "10:55:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-05T10:55:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-05T10:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "url": "https://www.canindia.com/russian-action-jeopardising-ukrainian-nuclear-power-plant/", "title": "'Russian action jeopardising Ukrainian nuclear power plant' CanIndia News", "body": "Action by Russian forces is likely jeopardising security and safety at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in south-eastern Ukraine, the UK's Ministry of Defence reported on Friday based on information from the British intelligence services.\n\n\"Following five months of occupation, Russia's intentions regarding the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant remain unclear,\" dpa news agency quoted the Ministry as saying.\n\n\"However, the actions they have undertaken at the facility have likely undermined the security and safety of the plant's normal operations.\"\n\nRussian forces had used artillery units based in areas near the power station to target Ukrainian territory on the west bank of the Dnipro river, the report said.\n\nIt added that the Russians had used the area around the plant, in particular the adjacent city of Enerhodar, to rest their forces, \"utilising the protected status of the nuclear power plant to reduce the risk to their equipment and personnel from overnight Ukrainian attacks\".\n\nOn March 4, the nuclear and thermal power stations were both captured by Russian forces.\n\nThe plant continues to be operated by Ukrainian staff, under Russian control.\n\nOn Wednesday, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi expressed grave concerns about the physical integrity of the plant, whether all necessary repairs and maintenance were being done, and the security of nuclear material.", "source": {"uri": "canindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Canindia News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "korea_newswire@canindia.com", "name": "Korea Newswire", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.canindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/imageCireplace.png", "eventUri": "eng-7916201", "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 1, "stanza_neu": 7, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 8, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7141826631", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-06", "time": "08:38:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-06T08:38:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-06T07:47:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6627451181411743, "url": "https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2022/08/ukraine-220805-rferl02.htm", "title": "Ukraine, Russia Trade Blame On Shelling At Nuclear Power Plant As Fighting Rages In Donetsk", "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia must take responsibility for an \"act of terror\" after Kyiv and Moscow traded blame for strikes at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant in Ukraine.\n\n\"Today, the occupiers have created another extremely risky situation for all of Europe: they struck the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant twice.

While Russia has accused Ukraine of attacking the plant, international monitors now worry that the conflict will produce a nuclear disaster.\n\nThe second round of shots came in the form of rocket-propelled grenades that struck Zaporizhzhia \"near one of the power units where the nuclear reactor is located,\" Energoatom said in its post. The attack seriously damaged the plant's nitrogen-oxygen station and \"combined auxiliary building.\"\n\n\"There are risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances.

Kyiv then earns enough money to pay back debts while the EU makes a dent in its plan to save enough gas for a Russia-free winter.\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO, Galushchenko claimed Ukraine could immediately increase its power exports to the West from 100 megawatts (MW) to 1,690 MW.\n\nThe problem? \"The technicians,\" he grumbled.\n\nUkraine's repeated proclamations of a potential nuclear accident if Russia continues to control the Zaporizhzhia nuclear station, Ukraine's largest power plant, have clearly spooked Europe. Those warnings, aimed at raising the EU's sense of urgency in the early days of the war, now risk undermining trust in its nuclear safety.\n\nUkraine wasn't supposed to be linked up with the European grid at all until 2023. But after the Russian invasion, Kyiv unplugged from the Soviet-era power grid linking it to the Russian and Belarusian electricity systems and ENTSO-E, the EU's network of power grid operators, authorized an emergency connection to the west.\n\nGalushchenko is gunning for more acceleration in the form of weekly ramp-ups of power exports, but European operators are sticking to their protocols.\n\nENTSO-E has said it prefers slowly raising volumes by an incremental 100 MW each month to ensure safe operation.\n\n\"The procedures! According to the procedure!\" Galushchenko complained. \"If we had followed the procedures during the war, probably the Russians would be in Kyiv.\"\n\nENTSO-E did not respond to a request for comment on the talks, but on Friday approved an increase of power trade with Ukraine to 250 MW. \"The possibility of further increasing trade capacity will be assessed in September based on power system stability and security considerations,\" it said in a statement.\n\nRussia has occupied Zaporizhzhia since March. While day-to-day operations remain in the hands of Ukrainian workers, staff from Rosatom, Russia's nuclear operator, are also present.\n\nIn the interview, Galushchenko insisted that current operation of the nuclear station is safe enough to allow for more power trade with Europe -- but also rejected a potential visit from the IAEA to inspect the site and declare it safe while it is still under Russian control\n\nThe ideal situation, the minister added, would be for Ukraine to regain full control of the plant so it can increase output and sell more electricity to the EU.\n\n\"I hope the Russians will be out, because then ... the Zaphorizhzhia NPP this year in winter, operating with all six units, [can] produce 6,190 megawatts, which is incredible,\" the minister said.\n\nCurrently the site has just three reactors operating, and the tense situation has already led to warnings of compromised safety.\n\nThe IAEA declined to comment for this article, but in its latest update about the situation in Ukraine said: \"Recent reports about [Zaporizhzhia] indicate an increasingly alarming situation there ... suggesting that the already difficult and stressful conditions facing Ukrainian staff at the plant have deteriorated further.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Rosatom said in an emailed statement that its employees offer \"technical, consulting, communications and other assistance to the operator if required\" and \"do not interfere in the executive decision making of the plant's management, nor do they in any way take part in security, perimeter access control or other control-related activities.\"\n\nGalushchenko accused IAEA Director Rafael Mariano Grossi of downplaying the risks of Russia's presence at the power station.\n\nThe IAEA maintains it is \"an independent and impartial organization\" -- but an early March agency press release referring to the invasion as \"the Russian Federation's military operation\" still rankles Galushchenko.\n\n\"I have this feeling that the position of IAEA is, 'We are a technical organization so we cannot comment on some political issues, we're just technicians, don't ask us to make political declarations,'\" the minister said. \"But you cannot just say occupation by military or the shelling by tanks of a nuclear station is just a technical issue, that's an issue of nuclear safety ... You cannot just say it's OK.\"\n\nIn late April, Galushchenko and Grossi met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss organizing an IAEA safety mission to the captured Zaporizhzhia plant -- but Kyiv was put off because Grossi met with the Rosatom CEO in Russia first, and had already sought and obtained permission from Moscow to cross into the Russian occupation zone to the nuclear site before discussing the matter with Ukraine.\n\nGalushchenko maintains that an IAEA visit under the current circumstances risks entrenching Russia's control over Zaporizhzhia.\n\n\"We know that the Russians pushed them to come. They want them to come and then the IAEA would say: 'Oh, everything is OK, the nuclear material is OK, radiation is OK, Russians are perfect guys,'\" Galushchenko said. \"We will never accept this because ... that's a legitimization of the Russian occupation of the station.\"\n\nGrossi has expressed his concerns about the war and its consequences on the operations of nuclear reactors in Ukraine several times -- most recently at a Monday U.N. meeting, where he strongly condemned attacks against nuclear power stations.\n\nDespite opposition from Kyiv, Grossi continues to push for a site visit.\n\n\"If an accident occurs at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, we will not have a natural disaster to blame.

Since March, when Russian troops seized control of the city of Energodar, where the Zaporizhzhia plant is located, there have been back-and-forth accusations that both Russian and Ukrainian forces have launched artillery attacks on the nuclear facility.\n\nThe IAEA reports that it has had only limited -- \"faulty\" and \"patchy\" -- contact with the Ukrainian technical staff who continue to work in the Russian military-controlled nuclear plant. Moreover, the IAEA's connection with the plant's electronic surveillance system has been repeatedly lost. Grossi stated, \"We can't afford faulty communication with the plant in areas relevant to safety. We know of allegations that live ammunition is stored in the plant, that there are attacks on the power plant. Frankly, if I don't have access, I can't determine that. There are contradictions between the accounts of the Russian and Ukrainian sides.\"\n\nMultiple risks: According to the New York Times, Russian forces have positioned multiple rocket launchers between reactor buildings at Zaporizhzhia \"to protect them from retaliatory strikes.\" The Russians have also reputedly parked military vehicles in the turbine room of a reactor building, blocking a fire access route. In addition, Times reports that last Friday \"a huge, roiling plume of black smoke rose a few miles south of the reactors at Zaporizhzhia, and the Ukrainian military said it had hit a Russian ammunition depot.\"\n\nAside from the risks to the nuclear plant and its stored spent fuel from possible artillery hits, there is concern about the \"fatigue and stress of the Ukrainian control room employees,\" according to the Times, who have allegedly been subjected to \"harsh interrogation\" by Russian soldiers.\n\nSupport for Ukraine's nuclear workers: The ANS-European Nuclear Society Ukrainian Nuclear Workers Humanitarian Fund was set up earlier this year to help nuclear professionals and their families in need during the conflict with Russia. All donations go directly to the Ukrainian Nuclear Society for essential medical supplies, personal protective equipment, batteries, flashlights, warm clothes, food, and other items.

In a statement, the Deputy Director of the Russian Foreign Ministry Nonproliferation and Arms Control Department, Igor Vishnevetskii said, \"We were ready to assist the IAEA in organizing an international mission of the Agency headed by the Director General to assess the condition of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and to inventory the nuclear material located there, as stipulated in the safeguards agreement.\"\n\nHowever, the UN Secretariat declined to authorise the inspection just a few days before an IAEA delegation was scheduled to visit the facility, the Russian official added.\n\nThese remarks came at a time when the Director General of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi alleged that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant that Russia seized control during its invasion of Ukraine is \"completely out of control.\" According to Grossi, the situation at Zaporizhzhia is getting more dangerous every day, Associated Press reported. The UN's nuclear chief also made a desperate plea to Russia and Ukraine to let experts fast access to the massive complex in order to restore stability and avert a nuclear catastrophe.\n\nReferring to IAEA's visit to the nuclear plant, Vishnevetskii informed that they planned the visit's schedule (at the end of June), organised the intricate travel details, and made sure the delegation's members were as secure as possible.\n\nBesides this, Vishnevetskii underlined that some delegations allegedly voiced worries about the environment near Ukraine's nuclear sites. They said that the presence of the Russian military was the cause of this. However, he has claimed that they have said repeatedly that Russian military forces have done nothing to compromise Ukraine's nuclear safety and security. To stop Ukrainian nationalist organisations and foreign mercenaries from taking advantage of the circumstances in the nation to carry out nuclear provocations that would have disastrous repercussions, he asserted, the Russian military placed the Chornobyl and Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant under protection.\n\nFurther, Vishnevetskii stated that Moscow has backed the IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi's effort from the beginning to arrive at a deal with Russia and Ukraine to guarantee the safety and security of nuclear plants situated in the war zone. \"We were ready to sign the document drafted by the Agency and prepared by the Director General.

said the tactics violated international humanitarian law and rebuffed criticism of its report.\n\n\"The findings... were based on evidence gathered during extensive investigations, which were subject to the same rigorous standards and due diligence processes as all of Amnesty International's work,\" secretary general Agnes Callamard told AFP in emailed comments.\n\nOn Friday, Zelenskyy's office

forces, says western official", "body": "Ukraine can strike Russian targets around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant because it is built to withstand terror attacks, a western official said yesterday , amid fears of a disaster on the scale of Chernobyl.\n\nKremlin forces have transformed the facility, Europe's largest nuclear plant, into a \"safe zone\" in recent weeks.\n\nThey have used it to launch artillery fire at targets in Ukrainian-held territories on the western bank of the Dnipro river, with little chance of return fire.\n\nThe UN's nuclear watchdog has warned that Russian occupation of the power plant is \"completely out of control\" and there was a serious risk of triggering an emergency like the 1986 Chernobyl meltdown.\n\nWith Russian equipment, including highly combustible ammunition, stored in its engine rooms, analysts believe Moscow is using the threat of a nuclear meltdown at the site to deter future donations of heavy weaponry by Ukraine's western allies.\n\nHowever, in a briefing, the western official said Ukraine need not be deterred from striking Russian targets in the area, as the nuclear power station was built to withstand heavy attacks.\n\n\"Ukraine will consider very carefully how to avoid taking major risks around the site,\" the source said.\n\n\"But I would bear in mind that nuclear power plants are designed to withstand terrorist attacks, including aircrafts hitting reactors.\n\n\"Please don't think we're looking at a Chernobyl-like situation... that's not the case,\" they added.\n\nKyiv last month used US-supplied kamikaze drones to strike Russian weapons and troops sheltering between the plant's cooling towers, some 137 metres from a reactor.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant, in the south-eastern city of Enerhodar, was captured by Russia in early March, days after its forces invaded Ukraine.\n\nKremlin forces on the ground had hoped it could be used as a base to repel a Ukrainian counter-offensive aimed at retaking Russian-held areas in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, which is gaining momentum.\n\nBut the official insisted Kyiv's charge into the south of the country would not be hampered by the Russian's entrenched position at the plant. \"It could always be surrounded or bypassed by Ukraine,\" the source added.\n\nA Russian-installed official in Ukraine said on Wednesday that Ukrainian forces had used western-supplied weapons to pummel the nuclear plant, which has two of its six reactors operating.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a US-based think-tank, said the intervention was probably designed to stoke western fears of a nuclear disaster in the hope allies downgrade their military support for Ukraine.\n\n\"Russian officials are framing Ukraine as irresponsibly using western-provided weapons and risking nuclear disaster to dissuade western and other allied states from providing additional support to Ukraine's looming southern counter-offensive,\" the ISW said.

Meanwhile, more grain ships departed from Ukrainian ports under a Turkey-brokered deal. DW rounds up the latest.\n\nUkraine and Russia on Friday pointed fingers at one another over shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.\n\nLocated in the city of Enerhodar, Zaporizhzhia has six reactors and generates more than one-fifth of Ukraine's national electricity needs when able to operate as normal. It is also Europe's largest nuclear plant.\n\nUkrainian energy company Energoatom accused Russia of attacking the power plant.\n\n\"Three strikes were recorded on the site of the plant, near one of the power blocks where the nuclear reactor is located,\" the energy firm said in a statement.\n\nUkraine's Foreign Ministry said the \"possible consequences of hitting an operating reactor are equivalent to the use of an atomic bomb.\" Ukraine said Russia is engaging in \"numerous provocations\" at the plant.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian-installed administration in Enerhodar blamed Ukrainian forces for damage to the plant site. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed Ukrainian forces \"carried out three artillery strikes\" on the plant and said Kyiv is responsible for \"acts of nuclear terrorism.\"\n\nIn its daily briefing about the war, British intelligence said actions by Russian forces at the Zaporizhzhia plant are endangering the safety and security of the facility.\n\nRussia has likely deployed artillery in areas adjacent to the plant to target areas on the opposite side of the Dnieper River. They are likely using the plant, which they seized in March, as a nuclear shield.\n\nRafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), described the situation in precarious terms during a nonproliferation conference in New York this week.\n\n\"All principles of nuclear safety have been violated in one way or another,\" Grossi said.\n\nHere are the other main headlines from the war in Ukraine on August 5.\n\nUkrainian officials and the Turkish Defense Ministry confirmed that three ships loaded with grain left Ukraine's Black Sea ports carrying more than 57,000 tons of corn, used mostly for animal feed.\n\nKyiv said two of the ships, the Maltese-flagged \"Rojen\" and the Turkish \"Polarnet\" -- carrying maize departed from Chornomorsk -- and the Panama-flagged \"Navi-Star,\" all left from Odessa.\n\n\"Our main goal is to increase the trans-shipment volume in our ports. We have to process 100 carriers per month to be able to export the necessary amount of foodstuffs,\" Ukrainian Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said.\n\nShipments of grain from Ukraine's ports have restarted following a deal made in July between Russia and Ukraine that was mediated by Turkey under UN auspices.\n\nAlready-high food prices have remained at elevated levels for months now amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with both Russia and Ukraine being among the world's leading exporters.\n\nEarlier in the week, a ship left Ukraine's port loaded with grain for the first time since February 24, when Russia invaded Ukraine. Twenty million tons of grain remain trapped in ports and storage silos in Ukraine due to the conflict.\n\nUkrainian Deputy Economy Minister Taras Kachka told The Financial Times that Ukraine would like to see the deal expanded beyond grain.\n\n\"What's the difference between grain and iron ore?\" Kachka asked.\n\nThe Kremlin announced on Friday that it would impose entry bans on dozens of Canadian citizens, after Ottawa sanctioned prominent Russian figures.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry said some of the 62 individuals targeted by the sanctions are known for \"their malicious activity in the fight against the 'Russian world' and our traditional values.\"\n\nThe move comes after Canada recently sanctioned the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill. Moscow said Canada is seeking to insult \"not only the multinational and multi-confessional people of Russia, but also Orthodox believers around the world, including Canada.\"\n\nKiril is a strong supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUS Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Friday that Russia's attacks on Ukraine will result in 40 million people around the world becoming food insecure. The African continent will be the hardest hit by the food crisis.\n\nThomas-Greenfield accused Russia of using hunger as a weapon of war. She noted that African countries need to know who is behind food supply shortages.\n\nMany African countries are reluctant to criticize the invasion of Ukraine, as they engage with trade with Russia.\n\n\"Russia has systematically captured some of Ukraine's most productive farmland, spoiling fields with mines and bombs,\" Thomas-Greenfield said. \"Regardless of you feel about Russia, we all have a common interest in mitigating the impact of the war in Ukraine on food security.\"\n\nGermany's Federal Government Commissioner for Antiziganism, Mehmet Daimag\u00fcler, said financial assistance to Ukraine must also reach Romani people in the country.\n\nDaimag\u00fcler said the Roma people in Ukraine face discrimination in areas such as education and health care. He also emphasized that the German government should do more to make sure that the aid reaches Roma people in Ukraine who survived the Holocaust\n\nThe comments come after Daimag\u00fcler visited Ukraine with several other German officials.\n\nAccording to the co-chair of the Federal Association of Sinti and Roma, Daniel Strau\u00df, around 400,000 Romani-speaking people currently live in Ukraine. This comprises 1-1.5% of the population.\n\nHuman rights watchdog Amnesty International has defended a report which claims Ukrainian forces are endangering civilians.\n\n\"Our researchers have observed Ukrainian forces basing themselves in schools, residential buildings, hospitals in close proximity to where civilians live, which of course endangers those civilians who live in these buildings. Such conduct is in violation of international law and puts civilians at risk,\" Amnesty's senior crisis adviser, Donatella Rovera, told DW.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Amnesty's report \"unfortunately tries to amnesty the terrorist state and shift the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim.\"\n\nRovera said Zelenskyy's reaction was \"regrettable because I think if he takes a look at Amnesty's website, he will find a very significant body of work, several reports, many more press releases based on our field investigations, where we document extensively and in great detail war crimes and other serious violations of international law by Russian forces, including use of banned weapons, indiscriminate and deliberate strikes on civilians, extrajudicial execution, torture, abductions.\"\n\nUkraine said Russian troops have launched a significant offensive in the Donetsk region.\n\nUkraine's defensive line stretches from the towns of Soledar and Bakhmut, which the Russians are trying to capture to extend their control in Donetsk.\n\nPrior to the war, half a million people resided in this area, which is now heavily militarized.\n\nUkraine's general staff said fighting near Bakhmut has been inconclusive.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said fighting also continued near the villages of Pisky and Avdiivka. Russian state-run Tass news agency said Russian and pro-Russian forces had seized Pisky, whereas Ukraine has only acknowledged Russia's \"partial success\" in the last few days.\n\nFor years, Ukraine has fortified Pisky and seen the town as a defensive ground from which to buffer Russian proxy forces holding the city of Donetsk 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) to the south.\n\nUkrainian General Oleksiy Hromov said Ukraine retook two villages around the eastern city of Sloviansk but was pushed back to the town of Avdiivka. Ukrainian forces had to abandon a defensive position at a coal mine it considered significant.\n\nIn Mykolaiv along the southern front line, regional governor Vitaliy Kim told residents that authorities there are imposing a curfew from 11 p.m. (2000 GMT) Friday night until 5 a.m. Monday but that this did not mean the city was under any particular threat at present.\n\nMykolaiv is near Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine's Kherson region, where Ukraine has plans to conduct a counter-offensive.\n\nOn Telegram, Kim wrote, \"The city will be closed for the weekend. Please be understanding. We are also working on collaborators. Districts will undergo checks.\"\n\nRussian leader Vladimir Putin has signed a decree that prohibits foreign investors from countries it deems unfriendly from selling shares in key strategic businesses and banks through the end of 2022.\n\nThe ban is effective immediately and applies to the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas fields in Russia's far east. US oil giant ExxonMobil operates Sakhalin-1 and said this week that it was working on transferring nearly a third of the business to another firm.\n\nOther assets put under this form of hybrid protection include the Sakhalin-2 liquefied natural gas project, Karyaga oil field and several Russian banks, a list of which will be forthcoming from the Central Bank and must meet with Putin's approval.\n\nNumerous foreign banks including Austria's Raiffeisen, Italy's UniCredit and Intesa, and the US bank Citi continue to search for ways to exit the Russian market. Societe Generale and HSBC have already managed to find a way out.\n\nRussia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has demanded 14 Bulgarian diplomats leave Russia. The measure comes after 70 Russian diplomats were expelled by Sofia earlier this summer.\n\nThe Bulgarian ambassador was summoned and handed \"a ministerial note\" that stated \"14 staff members of the Bulgarian diplomatic and consular service in Russia were declared personae non gratae.\"\n\nSofia accused Russia's diplomats of espionage, and Russia threatened to cut diplomatic relations. Russia has far more people in Bulgaria owing to its size than Bulgaria does in Russia.\n\nUpon expelling the diplomats, the Russian Foreign Ministry said, \"We would like to emphasize that the responsibility for the consequences of these counterproductive steps rests entirely with the government of Bulgaria,\" and accused the country of taking actions that \"also testify to the further degradation of the collective West, which is ready to sacrifice the interests of partners in order to harm Russia.\"\n\nRussia also called Bulgaria's \"unconditional adherence\" destructive and regrettable.\n\nPope Francis has met with the second most powerful leader in the Russian Orthodox Church, Bishop Anthony. Next month, Pope Francis is expected to meet with Patriarch Kirill, who has been supportive of what Russia has termed \"special military operations\" in Ukraine.\n\nAnthony's predecessor was ousted in June in an abrupt move that indicated tensions at the top of Moscow's Patriarchate regarding the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Vatican disclosed the meeting by placing it on the list of official appointments but offered no details.\n\nThe meeting between Francis and Kirill is likely to occur in Nur-Sultan, the capital of Kazakhstan formerly known as Astana renamed for former president Nursultan Nazarbayev who left office in 2019.\n\nKirill is considered a close conservative ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He supports the war in Ukraine, seeing it as part of a struggle to protect Russian traditionalism against Western decadence.\n\nKirill's support for the war has caused a rift with the Vatican and caused a schism with several Orthodox churches and the Russian Orthodox Church. Francis has called the Russian invasion \"a cruel and senseless war of aggression.\"\n\nThe two had been scheduled to meet in Jerusalem in mid-June, but Francis called that off on the advice of Vatican diplomats.\n\nThe two met once before, in 2016 in Cuba. It was the first time a pope and a leader of the Russian Orthodox Church met since the Great Schism of 1054.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.dw.com/image/62727786_6.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7916201", "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 23, "stanza_neu": 65, "stanza_pos": 4, "swn_neg": 92, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7141512200", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-05", "time": "23:40:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-05T23:40:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-05T23:39:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5490196347236633, "url": "https://www.spacewar.com/afp/220805223638.o60biv3v.html", "title": "Kyiv, Moscow trade blame over nuclear plant", "body": "Russian troops have occupied the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine since the early days of their invasion and Kyiv has accused them of storing heavy weapons there.

However, extra terrorism charges could mean fewer rights and longer prison sentences, with Russian state media reporting that terrorist group members can get up to 10 years imprisonment.\n\nIn a statement, the Azov Regiment dismissed the ruling, accusing the Kremlin of \"looking for new excuses and explanations for its war crimes.\" It urged the US and other countries to label Russia a terrorist state.\n\nThe Azov soldiers played a key part in the defence of Mariupol, holding out against relentless Russian bombardment for weeks at the southern port city's sprawling steel mill.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed the soldiers as heroes, while Moscow has repeatedly portrayed the Azov Regiment as a Nazi group and accused it of atrocities.\n\nThese claims are largely unsubstantiated by Russia.\n\nThe Azov regiment has a checkered past. It grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades created to fight Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nIts initial fighters were drawn from the far-right.\n\nWhile its current members reject accusations of extremism, the Kremlin has seized on the regiment's right-wing origins to cast Russia's invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Russian state media has repeatedly shown what it claimed to be Nazi insignias, literature and tattoos associated with the regiment.\n\nRussia accused the United States of being directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine, claiming that US spies were approving and coordinating Ukrainian missile strikes on Russian forces.\n\nRussia's defence ministry, headed by a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, said Vadym Skibitsky, Ukraine's deputy head of military intelligence, had admitted to the Telegraph newspaper that Washington coordinates HIMARS missile strikes.\n\n\"All this undeniably proves that Washington, contrary to White House and Pentagon claims, is directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine,\" the defence ministry said.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has said he wants Ukraine to defeat Russia and has supplied billions of dollars of arms to Kyiv but US.officials do not want a direct confrontation between US and Russian soldiers.\n\nRussia said the Biden administration was responsible for missile attacks on civilian targets in areas controlled by Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"It is the Biden administration that is directly responsible for all Kyiv-approved rocket attacks on residential areas and civilian infrastructure in populated areas of Donbas and other regions, which have resulted in mass deaths of civilians,\" the defence ministry said.\n\nWashington said on Monday it would send $550-million (\u20ac535m) worth of aid in new weapons to Ukrainian forces fighting the Russian invasion, including ammunition for HIMARS rocket launchers.\n\nSome of Ukraine's most vulnerable have been caught up in a savage conflict far beyond their control.\n\nBefore the Russian invasion, there were around 2.7 million people with some form of physical or intellectual disability in Ukraine, according to Inclusion Europe, an EU disability organisation.\n\nIt says that even before the war, many were \"experiencing prolonged stigma, isolation and barriers to accessing community support\".\n\nHuman Rights Watch says disabled people often need special accessibility cars or ambulances, and have been struggling to find safety.\n\nThere is concern for the fate of the tens of thousands of disabled people living in residential institutions, such as orphanages or care homes.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ni19p7xEUWMC8nMi2mOB7A--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/euronews_uk_articles_973/2ebfb4aa106441e52a1bfa6814c30c73", "eventUri": "eng-7916201", "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 16, "stanza_neu": 52, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 69, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7141486259", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-05", "time": "22:52:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-05T22:52:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-05T22:51:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5333333611488342, "url": "https://www.rfi.fr/en/international-news/20220805-kyiv-moscow-trade-blame-over-nuclear-plant", "title": "Kyiv, Moscow trade blame over nuclear plant", "body": "Kyiv (Ukraine) (AFP) - Kyiv and Moscow accused each other of striking Europe's largest nuclear site on Friday, causing a reactor stoppage as three grain ships departed Ukraine under a deal to avert food shortages.\n\nRussian troops have occupied the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine since the early days of their invasion and Kyiv has accused them of storing heavy weapons there.

Meanwhile, more grain ships departed from Ukrainian ports under a Turkey-brokered deal. DW rounds up the latest.\n\nUkraine and Russia on Friday pointed fingers at one another over shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.\n\nLocated in the city of Enerhodar, Zaporizhzhia has six reactors and generates more than one fifth of Ukraine's national electricity needs when able to operate as normal.\n\nUkrainian energy company Energoatom accused Russia of shelling near the power plant on Friday.\n\n\"Three strikes were recorded on the site of the plant, near one of the power blocks where the nuclear reactor is located,\" the energy firm said in a statement.\n\nUkraine's foreign ministry said the \"possible consequences of hitting an operating reactor are equivalent to the use of an atomic bomb.\" Ukraine said Russia is engaging in \"numerous provocations\" at the plant.\n\nThe Russian-installed administration in Enerhodar blamed Ukrainian forces for damage to the plant site. Russia's defense ministry claimed Ukrainian forces \"carried out three artillery strikes\" on the plant and said Kyiv is responsible for \"acts of nuclear terrorism.\"\n\nIn its daily briefing about the war, British intelligence said actions by Russian forces at the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe's largest, are endangering the safety and security of the facility.\n\nRussia has likely deployed artillery in areas adjacent to the plant to target areas on the opposite side of the Dnieper River. They are likely using the plant, which they seized in March, as a nuclear shield.\n\nRafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), described the situation in precarious terms during a nonproliferation conference in New York this week.\n\n\"All principles of nuclear safety have been violated in one way or another,\" Grossi said.\n\nUkrainian officials and the Turkish Defense Ministry confirmed that three ships loaded with grain left Ukraine's Black Sea ports loaded with more than 57,000 tons of corn, used mostly for animal feed.\n\nKyiv said two of the ships, the Maltese-flagged \"Rojen\" and the Turkish \"Polarnet\" -- carrying maize departed from Chornomorsk -- and the Panama-flagged \"Navi-Star,\" all left from Odessa.\n\n\"Our main goal is to increase the trans-shipment volume in our ports. We have to process 100 carriers per month to be able to export the necessary amount of foodstuffs,\" Ukrainian Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said.\n\nShipments of grain from Ukraine's ports have restarted following a deal made in July between Russia and Ukraine that was mediated by Turkey under UN auspices.\n\nAlready-high food prices have remained at elevated levels for months now amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with both Russia and Ukraine being among the world's leading exporters.\n\nEarlier in the week, a ship left Ukraine's port loaded with grain for the first time since February 24, when Russia invaded Ukraine. Twenty million tons of grain remain trapped in ports and storage silos in Ukraine due to the conflict.\n\nUkrainian Deputy Economy Minister Taras Kachka told The Financial Times that Ukraine would like to see the deal expanded beyond grain.\n\n\"What's the difference between grain and iron ore?\" Kachka asked.\n\nThe Kremlin announced on Friday that it would impose entry bans on dozens of Canadian citizens, after Ottawa sanctioned prominent Russian figures.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry said some of the 62 individuals targeted by the sanctions are known for \"their malicious activity in the fight against the 'Russian world' and our traditional values.\"\n\nThe move comes after Canada recently sanctioned the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill. Moscow said Canada is seeking to insult \"not only the multinational and multi-confessional people of Russia, but also Orthodox believers around the world, including Canada.\"\n\nKiril is a strong supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUS Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Friday that Russia's attacks on Ukraine will result in 40 million people around the world becoming food insecure. The African continent will be the hardest hit by the food crisis.\n\nThomas-Greenfield accused Russia of using hunger as a weapon of war. She noted that African countries need to know who is behind food supply shortages.\n\nMany African countries are reluctant to criticize the invasion of Ukraine, as they engage with trade with Russia.\n\n\"Russia has systematically captured some of Ukraine's most productive farmland, spoiling fields with mines and bombs,\" Thomas-Greenfield said. \"Regardless of you feel about Russia, we all have a common interest in mitigating the impact of the war in Ukraine on food security.\"\n\nGermany's Federal Government Commissioner for Antiziganism, Mehmet Daimag\u00fcler, said financial assistance to Ukraine must also reach Romani people in the country.\n\nDaimag\u00fcler said the Roma people in Ukraine face discrimination in areas such as education and health care. He also emphasized that the German government should do more to make sure that the aid reaches Roma people in Ukraine who survived the Holocaust\n\nThe comments come after Daimag\u00fcler visited Ukraine with several other German officials.\n\nAccording to the co-chair of the Federal Association of Sinti and Roma, Daniel Strau\u00df, around 400,000 Romani-speaking people currently live in Ukraine. This comprises 1-1.5% of the population.\n\nHuman rights watchdog Amnesty International has defended a report which claims Ukrainian forces are endangering civilians.\n\n\"Our researchers have observed Ukrainian forces basing themselves in schools, residential buildings, hospitals in close proximity to where civilians live, which of course endangers those civilians who live in these buildings. Such conduct is in violation of international law and puts civilians at risk,\" Amnesty's senior crisis adviser, Donatella Rovera, told DW.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Amnesty's report \"unfortunately tries to amnesty the terrorist state and shift the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim.\"\n\nRovera said Zelenskyy's reaction was \"regrettable because I think if he takes a look at Amnesty's website, he will find a very significant body of work, several reports, many more press releases based on our field investigations, where we document extensively and in great detail war crimes and other serious violations of international law by Russian forces, including use of banned weapons, indiscriminate and deliberate strikes on civilians, extrajudicial execution, torture, abductions.\"\n\nUkraine said Russian troops have launched a significant offensive in the Donetsk region.\n\nUkraine's defensive line stretches from the towns of Soledar and Bakhmut, which the Russians are trying to capture to extend their control in Donetsk.\n\nPrior to the war, half a million people resided in this area, which is now heavily militarized.\n\nUkraine's general staff said fighting near Bakhmut has been inconclusive.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said fighting also continued near the villages of Pisky and Avdiivka. Russian state-run Tass news agency said Russian and pro-Russian forces had seized Pisky, whereas Ukraine has only acknowledged Russia's \"partial success\" in the last few days.\n\nFor years, Ukraine has fortified Pisky and seen the town as a defensive ground from which to buffer Russian proxy forces holding the city of Donetsk 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) to the south.\n\nUkrainian General Oleksiy Hromov said Ukraine retook two villages around the eastern city of Sloviansk but was pushed back to the town of Avdiivka. Ukrainian forces had to abandon a defensive position at a coal mine it considered significant.\n\nIn Mykolaiv along the southern front line, regional governor Vitaliy Kim told residents that authorities there are imposing a curfew from 11 p.m. (2000 GMT) Friday night until 5 a.m. Monday but that this did not mean the city was under any particular threat at present.\n\nMykolaiv is near Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine's Kherson region, where Ukraine has plans to conduct a counter-offensive.\n\nOn Telegram, Kim wrote, \"The city will be closed for the weekend. Please be understanding. We are also working on collaborators. Districts will undergo checks.\"\n\nRussian leader Vladimir Putin has signed a decree that prohibits foreign investors from countries it deems unfriendly from selling shares in key strategic businesses and banks through the end of 2022.\n\nThe ban is effective immediately and applies to the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas fields in Russia's far east. US oil giant ExxonMobil operates Sakhalin-1 and said this week that it was working on transferring nearly a third of the business to another firm.\n\nOther assets put under this form of hybrid protection include the Sakhalin-2 liquefied natural gas project, Karyaga oil field and several Russian banks, a list of which will be forthcoming from the Central Bank and must meet with Putin's approval.\n\nNumerous foreign banks including Austria's Raiffeisen, Italy's UniCredit and Intesa, and the US bank Citi continue to search for ways to exit the Russian market. Societe Generale and HSBC have already managed to find a way out.\n\nRussia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has demanded 14 Bulgarian diplomats leave Russia. The measure comes after 70 Russian diplomats were expelled by Sofia earlier this summer.\n\nThe Bulgarian ambassador was summoned and handed \"a ministerial note\" that stated \"14 staff members of the Bulgarian diplomatic and consular service in Russia were declared personae non gratae.\"\n\nSofia accused Russia's diplomats of espionage, and Russia threatened to cut diplomatic relations. Russia has far more people in Bulgaria owing to its size than Bulgaria does in Russia.\n\nUpon expelling the diplomats, the Russian Foreign Ministry said, \"We would like to emphasize that the responsibility for the consequences of these counterproductive steps rests entirely with the government of Bulgaria,\" and accused the country of taking actions that \"also testify to the further degradation of the collective West, which is ready to sacrifice the interests of partners in order to harm Russia.\"\n\nRussia also called Bulgaria's \"unconditional adherence\" destructive and regrettable.\n\nPope Francis has met with the second most powerful leader in the Russian Orthodox Church, Bishop Anthony. Next month, Pope Francis is expected to meet with Patriarch Kirill, who has been supportive of what Russia has termed \"special military operations\" in Ukraine.\n\nAnthony's predecessor was ousted in June in an abrupt move that indicated tensions at the top of Moscow's Patriarchate regarding the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Vatican disclosed the meeting by placing it on the list of official appointments but offered no details.\n\nThe meeting between Francis and Kirill is likely to occur in Nur-Sultan, the capital of Kazakhstan formerly known as Astana renamed for former president Nursultan Nazarbayev who left office in 2019.\n\nKirill is considered a close conservative ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He supports the war in Ukraine, seeing it as part of a struggle to protect Russian traditionalism against Western decadence.\n\nKirill's support for the war has caused a rift with the Vatican and caused a schism with several Orthodox churches and the Russian Orthodox Church. Francis has called the Russian invasion \"a cruel and senseless war of aggression.\"\n\nThe two had been scheduled to meet in Jerusalem in mid-June, but Francis called that off on the advice of Vatican diplomats.\n\nThe two met once before, in 2016 in Cuba. It was the first time a pope and a leader of the Russian Orthodox Church met since the Great Schism of 1054.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.dw.com/image/62727786_6.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7916201", "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 23, "stanza_neu": 63, "stanza_pos": 4, "swn_neg": 90, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7141508363", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-05", "time": "23:33:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-05T23:33:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-05T23:31:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5254902243614197, "url": "https://www.pehalnews.in/russia-ukraine-blame-each-other-over-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-attack/2302378/", "title": "Russia, Ukraine Blame Each Other Over Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant Attack - Pehal News", "body": "Ukraine claims that Russian rockets have broken a part of an enormous Russian-controlled nuclear energy plant.\n\nKyiv:\n\nKyiv and Moscow accused one another of putting Europe's largest nuclear website on Friday, inflicting a reactor stoppage as three grain ships departed Ukraine underneath a deal to avert meals shortages.\n\nRussian troops have occupied the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine because the early days of their invasion and Kyiv has accused them of storing heavy weapons there.

More grain ships left Ukraine's Black Sea ports on Friday.\n\n(See RSAN on the Bloomberg Terminal for the Russian Sanctions Dashboard.)\n\nWell into the conflict's sixth month, Ukraine is forcing Russia to reallocate forces and re-prioritize efforts in response to Kyiv's counteroffensive operations. Russian forces in the past 24 hours pursued an offensive aimed at seizing key locations in Donetsk, the Ukrainian military said on Saturday. Russian artillery and aviation struck targets in the direction of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, it said on Facebook. Artillery fire also hit various locations in the direction of Slovyansk, the general staff of the Ukrainian army said.\n\n(All times CET)\n\nZelenskiy Calls Russian Plant Shelling 'Act of Terror' (8 a.m.)\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russian forces fired at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest atomic facility, twice on Friday and called for sanctions against Moscow's nuclear industry.\n\n\"Any shelling of this facility is an open, brazen crime, an act of terror,\" Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. \"Russia should bear responsibility for the very fact of creating a threat to the nuclear power plant.\"\n\nRussia's defense ministry denied the reports, saying Ukraine was to blame. Russian forces have occupied the plant since early in their invasion of Ukraine. Russian forces have repeatedly used artillery systems deliberately positioned within the Zaporizhzhia complex to fire on targets across the Dnipro River, according to the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nWar About to Enter New Phase, UK Says (6:30 a.m.)\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine \"is about to enter a new phase\" with a front line stretching from near Zaporizhzhia southwest to Kherson, the UK defense ministry said in a Twitter thread. It said Moscow's troops are massing in the south in anticipation of a Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\n\"Long convoys of Russian military trucks, tanks, towed artillery, and other weapons continue to move away from Ukraine's Donbas region and are headed southwest,\" the UK said. Equipment was also on the move from Russian-occupied Melitopol, Mariupol and other areas.\n\nUkraine's forces are targeting on bridges, ammunition depots, and rail links with growing frequency in Ukraine's southern regions, the UK said. Kyiv is also looking to disrupt rail links from Kherson to Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nPutin, Erdogan Pledge Deeper Ties (7:58 p.m.)\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan held nearly four hours of talks Friday, as Ankara pushes for a mediating role to try to help end the war in Ukraine following the breakthrough deal on grain exports.\n\nWhile Turkey has long pushed for a role in brokering a peace settlement in Ukraine, Russia has so far been cool to the idea. Still, Erdogan is seen in Moscow as a potential go-between in the conflict, said two people familiar with the Kremlin's thinking, asking not to be identified because the matter is sensitive.\n\nPutin, Erdogan Stress Trust, Pledge Deeper Ties at Summit Talks\n\nUkraine Disconnects a Nuclear Plant Generator After Shelling (7:14 p.m.)\n\nUkraine's national nuclear power operator said it disconnected one of three generators that were operating at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, after Russian projectiles landed nearby.\n\nEnergoatom said on its Telegram channel that a high-voltage power line was damaged. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said that Russia has resorted to \"numerous provocations\" at the plant.\n\nRafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said this week that the plant, occupied by Russian forces since early in Moscow's invasion, is \"completely out of control\" and that \"every principle of nuclear safety has been violated.\"\n\nUkraine Shores Up Reserves, Helped by Devaluation (5:30 p.m.)\n\nUkraine's currency reserves held steady last month, marking a halt to a plunge as the central bank devalued the hryvnia in an attempt to rescue an economy battered by Russia's invasion.\n\nThe bank's stockpile of foreign currencies and gold slipped 1.8% in July to $22.4 billion, according to preliminary data released in Kyiv. The reserves had plunged as much as $2 billion a month since April as policy makers propped up government financing with heavy bond purchasing and market intervention to support the hryvnia.\n\nKremlin Escalates Estonian Row Over Soviet-Era Tank (4:25 p.m.)\n\nRussia escalated a dispute over the removal of a Soviet-era memorial in neighboring Estonia, compounding tensions in a European Union member state that has fiercely condemned the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPutin's chief spokesman on Friday called the plans to remove a World War II tank in the eastern Estonian city of Narva, which sits on the border with Russia, a \"war against history.\" Earlier, Estonia's president reinforced a pledge to remove communist-era memorials, saying Putin's invasion had disgraced memories of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany.\n\nUS, Russia Say They're Willing to Discuss Griner Prisoner Swap (3:06 p.m.)\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said they're willing to pursue talks on a prisoner exchange involving Griner, even as the diplomats didn't meet Friday at an ASEAN summit in Cambodia.\n\n\"There is a special channel agreed upon by the presidents,\" Lavrov told a news conference, a day after a Moscow court sentenced Griner to nine years on drug charges. \"Whatever is said publicly, that channel is still open.\"\n\nThe US is seeking a deal involving Griner and former US Marine Paul Whelan, who was jailed in Russia in 2020 on spying charges he denies. Washington has made a \"substantial proposal that Russia should engage with us on,\" said Blinken. \"What Foreign Minister Lavrov said this morning and said publicly is that they are prepared to engage through channels we've established to do just that and we'll be pursuing.\"\n\nRead more: 'Unacceptable' Griner Sentence Has Biden in Bind With Russia\n\nRussia Expels 14 Bulgarian Diplomats in Tit-for-Tat Move (2:04 p.m.)\n\nRussia declared 14 employees of Bulgarian embassy and consulates as personae non grata, responding to the earlier expulsion of 70 Russian diplomats, the Foreign Ministry in Moscow said in a statement.\n\nIt also blamed the government in Bulgaria, once a close ally, of taking counterproductive actions. Bulgaria expelled a record number of diplomats after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nKyiv Protests Amnesty Report on Endangering Civilians (9:46 a.m.)\n\nAmnesty International said Ukraine's military has endangered civilians \"by establishing bases and operating weapons systems in populated residential areas, including in schools and hospitals.\" The report drew a sharp rebuke from Kyiv. The head of the rights group's Ukrainian operation said her office wasn't involved in the preparation of the document and made \"repeated objections\" to the content.\n\nThursday's report said that Ukraine's actions \"in no way justify Russia's indiscriminate attacks, which have killed and injured countless civilians,\" but added that \"being in a defensive position does not exempt the Ukrainian military from respecting international humanitarian law.\"\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late Thursday that criticism of his military's defense aids Russian \"terrorists.\" He didn't mention Amnesty by name. Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said on Facebook that the human rights organization was \"losing its mind,\" by indirectly equating Russia's aggression and Ukraine's self-defense.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/img/tsn/logos/tsn-logo.png", "eventUri": "eng-7916201", "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 51, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 65, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7141383080", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-05", "time": "20:15:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-05T20:15:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-05T20:15:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5254902243614197, "url": "https://nampa.org/index.php?model=categories&function=display&id=21949968", "title": "Ukraine-Russia-conflict-nuclear-Zelensky lead", "body": "Russia must take responsibility for nuclear plant 'terror': Zelensky\n\nKyiv, Ukraine, Aug 5, 2022 (AFP) - President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday Russia must take responsibility for an \"act of terror\", after Kyiv and Moscow traded blame for strikes at Europe's largest nuclear plant.\n\nRussia earlier accused Kyiv's forces of striking Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and charged that Zelensky's government was committing acts of \"nuclear terrorism.\"\n\n\"Today, the occupiers have created a ...", "source": {"uri": "nampa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "nampa.org"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7916201", "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 3, "stanza_neu": 1, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 4, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7141828344", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-06", "time": "08:37:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-06T08:37:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-06T08:37:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5215686559677124, "url": "https://www.cairnspost.com.au/news/national/russian-shelling-of-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-risky-for-europe-zelensky-says/video/aff7e51632c71d84f2b54cdf9dd2f650", "title": "Russian Shelling of Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant &#8216;Risky&#8217; for Europe, Zelensky Says", "body": "Russian forces fired at Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, southeastern Ukraine, twice on August 5, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the government-run nuclear enterprise said.

And not only ahead but sideways as well because it's growing in ambition and in capacity.\n\n\"I think that everybody recognizes that, starting with the Iranians who are saying that they are making strides and amazing advances.\"\n\nThe progress has made monitoring Tehran's program an increasingly difficult task.\n\n\"It is not impossible to verify it,\" Grossi said. \"But it will only take a lot of work. Work of a new nature.\"\n\nThe IAEA chief was speaking on the sidelines of the Tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. State parties to the NPT gather every five years in New York to review the landmark 50-year-old treaty and the implementation of its provisions: preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, destroying the existing nuclear arsenal in order to eventually achieve a nuclear-weapon-free world and promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The last review took place in 2015, the year the JCPOA was signed. The current summit was supposed to take place in 2020 but was delayed by the pandemic.\n\nIt is taking place at a critical juncture where Iran is moving closer to acquiring enough fissile material for a nuclear device, China and North Korea are building up their nuclear arsenals, and Russia and the US are halting bilateral nuclear talks about their own programs. With such increasing nuclear risks, some analysts have warned that the NPT regime as a whole is at stake.\n\nAt the opening of the long-delayed high-level meeting, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres gave a dire warning that \"humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation.\"\n\n\"At this point, when we are discussing all these incredible crises that we are faced with, the NPT has given us a minimum common denominator that everybody has to abide by so that this thing doesn't go crazy,\" Grossi told Arab News.\n\n\"We have to be clear on who is doing what and where,\" he said, adding that the IAEA is \"inspired and guided in more than one way\" by the NPT.\n\nNegotiators who have been attempting to revive the JCPOA in Vienna are taking into consideration that any verification of Iran's program would require a \"degree of access commensurate with the characteristics of that program, in order to be able to verify it,\" said Grossi.\n\nIn June, Iran removed IAEA equipment, including 27 cameras installed under the JCPOA, after the agency's 35-nation Board of Governors passed a resolution criticizing Tehran for failing to explain uranium traces found at three undeclared sites.\n\n\"Of course this implies that for a long period of time, now approaching two months, we had our visibility significantly reduced on certain facilities where these cameras were located,\" said Grossi.\n\n\"So the issue of the whereabouts of the material and most importantly in the centrifuge part, the fabrication facilities, which is what this is mainly about -- we will have to come to terms with Iran on how to account for them, when and if they agree on reviving the JCPOA.\n\n\"When you talk about the JCPOA, what they may agree or disagree to is up to them. What I need is to verify that what they agree to is being complied with.\n\n\"They may decide to allow a discreet number of centrifuges of one type or the other. They may decide to go back to the agreement. And the understanding is they want to go back to the amounts and the quantities and the levels that were agreed to back in 2015.\n\n\"If this is done, we will have to look into more things, in the sense that there were a number of centrifuges back then. There are many more now. They have different technological capabilities as well, and there are more facilities producing these centrifuges.\n\n\"So now, if the Iranians say, 'I have this number of centrifuges' -- well, ok, thank you very much, but during two months, there were lots of activities in terms of producing parts for more centrifuges that the IAEA is not in a position to confirm.\n\n\"So we will have to find a way to address this. Again, it's not impossible, but it's technically very demanding and it needs Iran's agreement to be done.\"\n\nIt is not the number of centrifuges that matters, nor the breadth and depth of a nuclear program, but the transparency with which it is conducted, said Grossi. Evoking the third pillar of the NPT, which calls for promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy, he reiterated that there are no limitations on what countries can develop as long as they remain transparent and give IAEA inspectors \"all the access they need so that every gram of material\" is accounted for.\n\nJust as the NPT's opening remarks were being broadcast on Aug. 1, Mohammed Eslami, Iran's atomic energy chief, said that Tehran has the ability to build a nuclear weapon \"but does not plan to do so.\"\n\nGrossi declined to comment on the intention behind Eslami's statement, but he admitted: \"I don't like people talking about nuclear weapons, to be honest. I have devoted my entire life to nuclear non-proliferation. So, talk about nuclear weapons is not something I really fancy. But I am the head of the IAEA, and I do not tell countries what they can or cannot talk about.\n\n\"For me, what is important is that all activities in Iran are under strict IAEA verification. Then they can say what they want or don't want. It does not add anything to the value of the conversation.\"\n\nAsked whether the JCPOA needs to be rewritten in order to allow the IAEA to account for what happened when the cameras were off, Grossi said that more than the agreement itself, \"there will have some understanding between the IAEA and Iran.

It did not report any casualties.\n\nIt said staff of Russian nuclear operator Rosatom had left the plant in a hurry before the attacks, which damaged a power cable and forced one of the reactors to stop working.\n\n\"The possible consequences of hitting a working reactor are equivalent to using an atomic bomb,\" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said.\n\nThe defence ministry in Moscow denied the reports.\n\n\"Ukrainian armed units carried out three artillery strikes on the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the city of Energodar,\" it said.\n\nThe new spike in tensions came as Russian President Vladimir Putin was meeting his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi.\n\nPutin thanked Erdogan for helping orchestrate the resumption of Ukrainian grain shipments, the first of which is due to arrive in Lebanon on Sunday, the Ukraine embassy there said.\n\nThe Sierra Leone-flagged bulk carrier Razoni set sail from the Ukrainian port of Odessa on Monday carrying 26,000 tonnes of corn -- the first departure under a UN-backed deal, brokered with Turkish help, to ease the global food crisis.\n\nKyiv said another three ships loaded with grain set sail from Ukraine on Friday, heading for Turkey and markets in Ireland and Britain. A further 13 are waiting to depart.\n\n\"Deliveries have already begun. I want to thank you, both for this and for the fact that at the same time an accompanying decision was made on uninterrupted supplies of Russian food and fertilisers to world markets,\" Putin told Erdogan in Sochi.\n\nAsli Aydintasbas, a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a report last week that the war in Ukraine had \"restored Turkey's self-image as a key geopolitical player\" and given Erdogan a higher profile than at any time in recent years.\n\nThe Turkish leader wants to translate the success into truce talks in Istanbul between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe rare diplomatic breakthrough was overshadowed by events on the ground in Ukraine, and Moscow's announcement on Friday that it was imposing entry bans on 62 Canadian citizens including government officials.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry said the list included figures known for \"their malicious activity in the fight against the 'Russian world' and our traditional values\".\n\nIn Ukraine, a controversy has flared over accusations that it is violating international law and endangering civilians in its fight against the Russian invasion.\n\nAmnesty International released a report on Thursday listing incidents in 19 cities and towns where Ukrainian forces appeared to have put civilians in harm's way by establishing bases in residential areas.\n\nPresident Zelensky equated the accusations to victim-blaming. In his evening address on Thursday, he said the rights group had sought to offer \"amnesty (to) the terrorist state and shift the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim\".\n\n\"There is no condition, even hypothetically, under which any Russian strike on Ukraine becomes justified. Aggression against our state is unprovoked, invasive and terrorist,\" he added.\n\n\"If someone makes a report in which the victim and the aggressor are supposedly equal in some way... then this cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nAmnesty said a four-month investigation had found that the Ukrainian military had established bases in schools and hospitals, and launched attacks from populated areas.\n\nIt said the tactics violated international humanitarian law and rebuffed criticism of its report.\n\n\"The findings... were based on evidence gathered during extensive investigations, which were subject to the same rigorous standards and due diligence processes as all of Amnesty International's work,\" Secretary General Agnes Callamard told AFP in emailed comments.\n\nOn Friday, Zelensky's office and local authorities reported Russian bombardments overnight targeting the southern city of Mykolaiv with widely-banned cluster bombs and heavy artillery -- wounding 20 people, including a 14-year-old boy.\n\nMykolaiv is on the main route to Odessa, Ukraine's biggest port on the Black Sea, and is the closest city to the southern front.\n\nSeveral missiles struck Zaporizhzhia city overnight and there was heavy bombardment of Ukraine's second city Kharkiv, in the northeast.\n\nUkrainian forces are conducting a counter-offensive in the south, where they claim to have retaken more than 50 villages previously controlled by Moscow.", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceWar"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7916201", "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 23, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 35, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7141096381", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-05", "time": "15:08:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-05T15:08:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-05T14:46:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4470588266849518, "url": "https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/ukraine-says-russian-shelling-hit-power-line-at-nuclear-power-plant", "title": "Ukraine says Russian shelling hit power line at nuclear power plant", "body": "KYIV -- Ukraine's Energoatom state nuclear power company said a high-voltage power line at its Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had been hit by Russian shelling on Friday, but that the plant still worked and no radioactive discharges had been detected.\n\nThe statement came shortly after the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Ukrainian city of Enerhodar said power lines at the plant had been damaged by a Ukrainian strike.
