The area, including the city of Kherson, is now the target of a Ukrainian counter-offensive.\n\nUkraine appealed for the area around the complex to be demilitarized and for the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, to be let in. Russia said it too favored an IAEA visit, which it accused Ukraine of blocking while trying to \"take Europe hostage\" by shelling the plant.\n\nUkraine blamed Russia for weekend attacks around the complex, which is still being run by Ukrainian technicians. It said three radiation sensors were damaged and two workers injured by shrapnel.\n\nAs of Monday morning, the plant appeared to still be running, said Petro Kotin, head of Ukraine's state nuclear power company Energoatom.

It has continued operating at reduced capacity since Russian forces captured it early in March, with Ukrainian technicians remaining at work.\n\nOn Sunday, Ukraine's state energy company Energoatom said that one worker was injured by Russian shelling around the plant on Saturday.\n\nEnergoatom claimed that three radiation monitoring sensors were also damaged, saying \"timely detection and response in case of aggravation of the radiation situation or leakage of radiation from spent nuclear fuel casks are currently impossible.\"\n\n\"This time a nuclear catastrophe was miraculously avoided, but miracles cannot last forever,\" the company added.\n\nSpeaking on Ukrainian television, Energoatom's chairman Petro Kotin said one strike Sunday was up to 20 meters away from the processed fuel storage area.\n\n\"If they had hit the containers with the processed fuel, it would be a radiation accident,\" he said.\n\nKotin suggested that if one container was hit \"it will be a local accident on the territory of the plant and nearby territory. If it's two (or) three containers -- the affected area will increase.\"\n\nKotin also said that during the shelling, communication lines between the nuclear plant, the hydroelectric power plant and the Ukrainian energy system had been ruptured.\n\n\"As of now Zaporizhzhia NPP (nuclear power plant) is only connected to the Ukrainian energy system with just one communication line. If all the lines are damaged, the plant will transfer to the so-called 'black-out' mode, meaning become completely de-energized. And this situation will be very dangerous for keeping fuel in nuclear reactors in a safe condition,\" he said.\n\nIt was the second time in as many days that the plant was hit. Ukraine and Russia have traded blame for both attacks.\n\nThe Russian-backed authorities in the nearest city -- Enerhodar-- claimed that a Ukrainian missile landed within 400 meters of one of the plant's reactors. The city was seized by Russian forces at the same time as the power plant.\n\n\"Tonight, the armed formations of Ukraine struck with a Uragan 220 mm rocket missile cluster rocket,\" the local authority claimed, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.\n\n\"Administrative buildings and the adjoining territory of the dry cask storage facility were damaged by the projectiles. It is important to note that the place of impact of warhead shrapnel and the rocket propulsion engine itself is no more than 400 meters from the active reactor,\" the authorities said.\n\nCNN cannot verify claims made by either side. The Russians have been shelling the Ukrainian-held town of Nikopol from positions around the plant.\n\nFears about the security of Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have been growing since Russian forces seized the site, but reached an inflection point on Friday when shelling damaged a high-voltage power line and forced one of the plant's reactors to stop operating -- despite no radioactive leak being detected.\n\nAfter the attack, Energoatom said that Russian shellfire had damaged a nitrogen-oxygen station and the combined auxiliary building, and that there were \"still risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances, and the fire hazard is also high.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the director general of the IAEA, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said he was extremely concerned by the shelling \"which underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster that could threaten public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has accused Russia of using Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to wreak terror in Europe, said Sunday that he spoke with European Council President Charles Michel about the situation at the complex.\n\n\"Russian nuclear terror requires a stronger response from the international community - sanctions on the Russian nuclear industry and nuclear fuel,\" Zelensky tweeted.\n\nThe IAEA has been trying to coordinate a mission of safeguarding experts to visit the plant since it was seized by Russian forces. Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, Ukraine's ambassador to the IAEA in Vienna, warned of catastrophic consequences if anything were to happen to the plant during a Monday press conference, saying it would not be \"comparable even to Chernobyl or to Fukushima.\"\n\nTsymbaliuk said Ukraine would like to see a delegation of experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations visit the station to monitor its status but that Russia's military actions in Ukraine are making such a trip \"impossible.\"\n\nAs Russia and Ukraine blame each other for recent rocket and missile attacks close to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Energoatom's chairman Kotin said that Russian forces must be expelled from the plant and a demilitarized zone should be created on the territory of the plant.\n\nHe also repeated Ukrainian claims that Russia had moved weapons into the plant's power units.\n\n\"There are 14 units of heavy military equipment in the first power unit. There are 6 vehicles in the second engine room and we don't know what is inside those vehicles. There's heavy weaponry as well,\" he said.\n\nHe also claimed that Russian troops had occupied all the shelters at the power plant, and workers had nowhere to go when shelling occurred.\n\nSeveral Western and Ukrainian officials believe that Russia is now using the giant nuclear facility as a stronghold to shield their troops and mount attacks, because they assume Kyiv will not return fire and risk a crisis.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken has accused Moscow of using the plant to shield its forces, while Britain's ministry of defense said in a recent security assessment that Russia's actions at the complex sabotage the safety of its operations.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Enerhodar, Dmytro Orlov, said in late July that Russian forces had been observed using heavy weaponry near the plant because \"they know very well that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will not respond to these attacks, as they can damage the nuclear power plant.\"\n\nUkraine's foreign ministry warned on Friday that further attacks on the plant could be disastrous.\n\n\"The possible consequences of hitting an operating reactor are equivalent to the use of an atomic bomb,\" the ministry said on Twitter.", "source": {"uri": "cnnphilippines.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "cnnphilippines.com"}, "authors": [], "image": "http://cnnphilippines.com/.imaging/mte/demo-cnn-new/750x450/dam/cnn/2022/8/8/Zaporizhzhia-Nuclear-Plant_CNNPH.jpg/jcr:content/Zaporizhzhia-Nuclear-Plant_CNNPH.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 20, "stanza_neu": 23, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 44, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144705843", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-09", "time": "04:40:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-09T04:40:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-09T04:34:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8039215803146362, "url": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1643218/ukraine-russia-trade-blame-for-nuclear-plant-shelling-amid-global-alarm", "title": "Ukraine, Russia trade blame for nuclear plant shelling amid global alarm | Inquirer News", "body": "KYIV -- Kyiv and Moscow traded blame on Monday for the weekend shelling of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex amid international alarm that their battle for control of the plant could trigger catastrophe.\n\nCalling any attack on a nuclear plant \"suicidal\", United Nations chief Antonio Guterres demanded U.N. nuclear inspectors be given access to Zaporizhzhia, the largest complex of its kind in Europe.\n\nRussia's invading forces seized the southern Ukrainian region containing Zaporizhzhia in March, when the site was struck without damage to its reactors.

The Russian embassy in Washington also released a statement itemising the damage.\n\n\"Ukrainian nationalists launched an artillery strike on the territory of the specified object on Aug. 5. Two high-voltage power lines and a water pipeline were damaged as a result of the shelling. Only thanks to the effective and timely actions of the Russian military in covering the nuclear power facility, its critical infrastructure was not affected,\" the embassy said.\n\nThe head of Zaporizhzhia's occupying authorities, Evgeniy Balitskyi, said that Ukrainian forces were to blame and had \"decided to put the whole of Europe on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe\" by shelling the plant.\n\nUkraine says Russia has turned the plant into a military base, making it extremely hard to target the Russian troops and equipment inside. According to the New York Times, Russia has been using the plant as cover from which to fire on Ukrainian forces since mid-July.\n\nThe Washington-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessed on 3 August that Russian forces were likely to be using the power plant to \"play on western fears of a nuclear disaster in Ukraine in an effort to degrade western will to provide military support to a Ukrainian counteroffensive\". The ISW further said that Russia was \"effectively using the plant as a nuclear shield to prevent Ukrainian strikes on Russian forces and equipment\".\n\nIt has not been possible to independently determine which side was responsible for the attack on the power station.\n\nIAEA chief Rafael Mariano Grossi warned on Saturday that the latest attack \"underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster\".\n\nElsewhere, Russia is strengthening its positions and numbers on Ukraine's southern front to ready itself for a Ukrainian counteroffensive and is likely to be preparing the ground to attack, according to British and Ukrainian military authorities.\n\n\"Russian troops are almost certainly amassing in the south, either waiting for a Ukrainian counteroffensive or preparing to attack. Long convoys of Russian military trucks, tanks, artillery and other things continue to move from the Donbas to the south-west,\" said the UK's defence ministry, confirming early assertions by Ukraine's deputy military intelligence chief.\n\nAccording to a separate source with Ukraine's military intelligence, Russian forces are creating fire damage along the frontlines in the occupied Kherson region to stop Ukrainian forces from pushing out of their positions, and adding more units to attack Mykolaiv and south Dnipropetrovsk region, as well as conducting aerial reconnaissance of the area with drones. In occupied Zaporizhzhia region, the Russians are actively attacking Ukrainian troops while bringing in new units to strengthen their numbers, according to the same source.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isobel_koshiw@theguardian.com", "name": "Isobel Koshiw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a471ac357749ae57101610777fd06e13ccae5e5b/82_0_2704_1622/master/2704.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=156036a486cf801d8c3077d216a8bcd0", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 2, "stanza_neu": 24, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 26, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144412320", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "20:44:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T20:44:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T20:43:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7843137383460999, "url": "http://accesswdun.com/article/2022/8/1122899", "title": "Russia, Ukraine trade accusations over nuclear plant attacks", "body": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia and Ukraine traded accusations Monday that each side is shelling Europe's biggest nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. Russia claimed that Ukrainian shelling caused a power surge and fire and forced staff to lower output from two reactors, while Ukraine has blamed Russian troops for storing weapons there.\n\nNuclear experts have warned that more shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which was captured by Russia early in the war, is fraught with danger.\n\nThe Kremlin echoed that Monday, claiming that Kyiv was attacking the plant and urging Western powers to force a stop to that.\n\n\"Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. \"It's fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for the entire Europe.\"\n\nUkraine's military intelligence spokesman, Andriy Yusov, countered that Russian forces have planted explosives at the plant to head off an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive in the region. Previously, Ukrainian officials have said Russia is launching attacks from the plant and using Ukrainian workers there as human shields.\n\nYusov called on Russia to \"make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nUkraine's ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, likewise urged that the United Nations, the IAEA and the international community send a delegation to \"completely demilitarize the territory\" and provide security guarantees to plant employees and the city where the plant is based, Enerhodar.\n\nHe accused Russia of \"nuclear terrorism.\"\n\nThe IAEA is the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog. Its director-general, Rafael Grossi, told The Associated Press last week that the situation surrounding the Zaporizhzhia plant \"is completely out of control,\" and issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to allow experts to visit the complex to stabilize the situation and avoid a nuclear accident.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced support for that idea Monday, saying, \"any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing.\"\n\nOne expert in nuclear materials at Imperial College London said the reactor at Zaporizhzhia is modern and housed inside a heavily reinforced steel-and-concrete building designed to protect against disasters.\n\n\"As such, I do not believe there would be a high probably of a breach of the containment building, even if it was accidently struck by an explosive shell, and even less likely the reactor itself could be damaged,\" said Mark Wenman at the college's Nuclear Energy Futures.\n\nHe also said the complex's spent fuel tanks, where the shells reportedly hit, are strong and probably don't contain much spent fuel.\n\n\"Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would be illegal according to international law, the likelihood of a serious nuclear release is still small,\" he said.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the attack Sunday caused a power surge and smoke, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished flames, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nAnd the head of the Ukrainian company operating the plant said all but one power line connecting it to Ukraine's energy system had been destroyed. Petro Kotin, head of the Ukrainian state corporation Eherhoatom, blamed Russian shelling and said a blackout would be \"very unsafe for such a nuclear facility.\"\n\nAs fighting continued on the front lines of the war, the United States on Monday pledged another $1 billion in new military aid for Ukraine. It would be the biggest delivery yet of rockets, ammunition and other arms straight from U.S. Department of Defense stocks for Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe latest announcement brings total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine by the Biden administration to $9.1 billion since Russian troops invaded on Feb. 24.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said the Russians had shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the previous 24 hours, killing five people. Among the targets, it said, was Nikopol, a city just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Gas pipelines, plumbing and power lines were no longer functioning there, leaving thousands of people without electricity.\n\nRussian rockets and artillery also hit eight municipalities in the northern Sumy region on Monday, killing one person, authorities there said.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south, officials there said, including the strategic Antonivskiy bridge in the southern city of Kherson. An artery for Russian military supplies, the bridge has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling. Plans to reopen it on Wednesday were now shelved, said Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the ships that left Ukraine on Friday under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis arrived in Turkey, the first loaded vessel to reach its destination. The Turkey-flagged Polarnet, laden with 12,000 tons of corn, docked at the port of Derince.\n\n\"This sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Ukraine won't abandon you,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. \"If Russia sticks to its obligations, the 'grain corridor' will keep maintaining global food security.\"\n\nTwelve ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- 10 outbound and two inbound. Some 322,000 metric tons of agricultural products have left Ukrainian ports, the bulk of it corn but also sunflower oil and soya.\n\nFour ships that left Ukraine on Sunday were expected to anchor near Istanbul on Monday evening for inspection Tuesday to make sure they are carrying only food items.\n\nThe first cargo ship to leave Ukraine, the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, which left Odesa on Aug. 1, hit a snag with delivery, however. It was heading for Lebanon with 26,000 metric tons of corn for chicken feed but the corn's buyer in Lebanon refused to accept the cargo, since it was delivered so much later than its contract, Ukraine's embassy in Beirut said.\n\nKareem Chehayeb in Beirut, Mehmet Guzel in Derince, Turkey, and Andrew Wilks in Istanbul contributed.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri": "accesswdun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Access WDUN"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://binaryapi.ap.org/35dbca4d7a4149a4bddc55ecc46ef32e/preview.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 16, "stanza_neu": 26, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 43, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144069470", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "14:33:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T14:33:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T12:37:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7803921699523926, "url": "https://www.wishtv.com/news/international/un-chief-condemns-suicidal-shelling-around-ukrainian-nuclear-plant/", "title": "UN chief condemns 'suicidal' shelling around Ukrainian nuclear plant", "body": "(CNN) -- United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described recent artillery and rocket fire around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in central Ukraine as \"suicidal,\" further adding to fears of an accident at the plant, which is the largest of its kind in Europe.\n\n\"Any attack on nuclear power plants is a suicidal thing,\" Guterres told reporters Monday in Tokyo. \"I hope that these attacks will end,\" he said, and called on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to be given access to the plant.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant occupies an extensive site on the river Dnipro.

Russia claimed that Ukrainian shelling caused a power surge and fire and forced staff to lower output from two reactors, while Ukraine has blamed Russian troops for storing weapons there.\n\nNuclear experts have warned that more shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which was captured by Russia early in the war, is fraught with danger.\n\nAlso Read | Muharram 2022: Six People Die, Dozen Unconscious Due to Suffocation at Muharram Procession in Pakistan's Sindh Province.\n\nThe Kremlin echoed that Monday, claiming that Kyiv was attacking the plant and urging Western powers to force a stop to that.\n\n\"Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. \"It's fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for the entire Europe.\"\n\nAlso Read | Boy Who Underwent Surgery for Dense Cataracts in Both Eyes When He Was Four-Month-Old Leads a Normal Life.\n\nBut Ukraine's military intelligence spokesman, Andriy Yusov, countered that Russian forces have planted explosives at the plant to head off an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive in the region. Previously, Ukrainian officials have said Russia is launching attacks from the plant and using Ukrainian workers there as human shields.\n\nYusov called on Russia to \"make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nUkraine's ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, likewise urged that the United Nations, the IAEA and the international community send a delegation to \"completely demilitarize the territory\" and provide security guarantees to plant employees and the city where the plant is based, Enerhodar.\n\nHe accused Russia of \"nuclear terrorism.\"\n\nThe IAEA is the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog. Its director-general, Rafael Grossi, told The Associated Press last week that the situation surrounding the Zaporizhzhia plant \"is completely out of control,\" and issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to allow experts to visit the complex to stabilize the situation and avoid a nuclear accident.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced support for that idea Monday, saying, \"any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing.\"\n\nOne expert in nuclear materials at Imperial College London said the reactor at Zaporizhzhia is modern and housed inside a heavily reinforced steel-and-concrete building designed to protect against disasters.\n\n\"As such, I do not believe there would be a high probably of a breach of the containment building, even if it was accidently struck by an explosive shell, and even less likely the reactor itself could be damaged,\" said Mark Wenman at the college's Nuclear Energy Futures.\n\nHe also said the complex's spent fuel tanks, where the shells reportedly hit, are strong and probably don't contain much spent fuel.\n\n\"Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would be illegal according to international law, the likelihood of a serious nuclear release is still small,\" he said.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the attack Sunday caused a power surge and smoke, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished flames, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nOn the front lines of the war, the fighting continued as the United States pledged another $1 billion in new military aid for Ukraine. Monday's pledge promises the biggest yet delivery of rockets, ammunition and other arms straight from U.S. Department of Defense stocks for Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe latest announcement brings total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine by the Biden administration to $9.1 billion since Russian troops invaded on Feb. 24.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said the Russians had shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the previous 24 hours, killing five people. Russia said Monday it will keep up its military operation in Ukraine until it achieves its goals.\n\nAmong the targets, the presidential office said, was Nikopol, a city just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Gas pipelines, plumbing and power lines were no longer functioning there, leaving thousands of people without electricity.\n\nElsewhere, Ukrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south, local officials said, including the strategic Antonivskiy bridge in the southern city of Kherson. An artery for Russian military supplies, the bridge has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling. Plans to reopen it on Wednesday were now shelved, said Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region.\n\nIn Melitopol, a Russian-controlled city in the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region, the mayor said Ukraine used U.S. HIMARS rocket launchers to shell several Russian military facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the ships that left Ukraine under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis arrived in Turkey, the first loaded vessel to reach its destination. The Turkey-flagged Polarnet, laden with 12,000 tons of corn, docked at the port of Derince after setting off from the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk on Friday.\n\n\"This sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Ukraine won't abandon you,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. \"If Russia sticks to its obligations, the grain corridor' will keep maintaining global food security.\"\n\nYet Polarnet Captain Ahmet Yucel Alibeyler noted the risks faced by ships trying to cross the Black Sea.\n\n\"These were, of course, dangerous areas, corridors that had been cleared, demined,\" he said.\n\nA total of 12 ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- 10 outbound and two inbound. Some 322,000 metric tons of agricultural products have left Ukrainian ports, the bulk of it corn but also sunflower oil and soya.\n\nFour ships that left Ukraine on Sunday are expected to anchor near Istanbul on Monday evening for inspection Tuesday to make sure they are carrying only food items.\n\nThe first cargo ship to leave Ukraine, the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, which left Odessa on Aug. 1, hit a snag with its cargo, however. It was heading for Lebanon with 26,000 metric tons of corn for chicken feed but ran into a business dispute and will no longer dock there, the Tripoli port chief said. Ukraine's embassy in Beirut tweeted Monday that the corn's buyer in Lebanon refused to accept the cargo, since it was delivered so much later than its contract. A new buyer is being sought.

It has continued operating at reduced capacity since Russian forces captured it early in March, with Ukrainian technicians remaining at work.\n\nOn Sunday, Ukraine's state energy company Energoatom said that one worker was injured by Russian shelling around the plant on Saturday.\n\nEnergoatom claimed that three radiation monitoring sensors were also damaged, saying \"timely detection and response in case of aggravation of the radiation situation or leakage of radiation from spent nuclear fuel casks are currently impossible.\"\n\n\"This time a nuclear catastrophe was miraculously avoided, but miracles cannot last forever,\" the company added.\n\nIt was the second time in as many days that the plant was hit.

On Sunday, Grossi said the agency must \"go to Zaporizhia just as we did to Chernobyl and South Ukraine earlier in the year. We can put together a safety, security and safeguards mission and deliver the indispensable assistance and impartial assessment that is needed.\"\n\nThe European Union's top diplomat has slammed Russia's military activities around the Zaporizhzya power plant and called for the IAEA to gain access to the complex.\n\n\"This is a serious and irresponsible breach of nuclear safety rules and another example of Russia's disregard for international norms,\" Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, said Saturday on Twitter.\n\nSeveral Western and Ukrainian officials believe that Russia is now using the giant nuclear facility as a stronghold to shield their troops and mount attacks, because they assume Kyiv will not return fire and risk a crisis.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken has accused Moscow of using the plant to shield its forces, while Britain's ministry of defense said in a recent security assessment that Russia's actions at the complex sabotage the safety of its operations.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Enerhodar, Dmytro Orlov, said in late July that Russian forces had been observed using heavy weaponry near the plant because \"they know very well that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will not respond to these attacks, as they can damage the nuclear power plant.\"\n\nUkraine's foreign ministry warned on Friday that further attacks on the plant could be disastrous.\n\n\"The possible consequences of hitting an operating reactor are equivalent to the use of an atomic bomb,\" the ministry said on Twitter.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The area is now being targeted by Ukraine for a counter-offensive.\n\nKyiv appealed for the area around the plant to be demilitarised and for the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN's nuclear watchdog, to be let in. Russia's foreign ministry said it too favoured an IAEA visit, which it accused Ukraine of blocking while trying to \"take Europe hostage\" by shelling the plant.\n\nUkraine blamed Russia for weekend attacks around the complex, which is still being run by Ukrainian technicians.\n\nIt said three radiation sensors were damaged and two workers injured by shrapnel.\n\nPetro Kotin, head of Ukraine's state nuclear power company Energoatom, called for peacekeepers to be deployed in and run the Zaporizhzhia site, with operational control handed back to Ukraine.\n\nHe flagged the danger of shells hitting containers of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel. If two or more were broken, it was \"impossible to assess the scale\" of the resulting disaster.\n\n\"Such insane actions could leave to the situation spiralling out of control and it will be a Fukushima or Chornobyl,\" Kotin said.\n\nDr Mark Wenman, a nuclear expert at Imperial College London, played down the risk of a major incident, saying the Zaporizhzhia reactors were relatively robust and the spent fuel well protected.\n\n\"Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would be illegal ...the likelihood of a serious nuclear release is still small,\" he said.\n\nYevhenii Tsymbaliuk, Ukraine's ambassador to the IAEA, said Zaporizhzhia staff were \"working under the barrels of Russian guns\".\n\nHe called for a UN-led mission to the Soviet-era plant this month.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry meanwhile said Ukrainian attacks had damaged power lines servicing the plant and forced it to reduce output by two of its six reactors to \"prevent disruption\".\n\nThe UN's Guterres said IAEA personnel needed access to \"create conditions for stabilisation\".\n\n\"Any attack (on) a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,\" he told a news conference in Japan, where he attended the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony on Saturday to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing.\n\nThe world's worst civil nuclear disaster occurred in 1986 when a reactor at the Chornobyl complex in northwest Ukraine exploded.\n\nSoon after this year's February 24 invasion, Russian troops occupied that site, withdrawing in late March.\n\nUkraine has said it is planning to conduct a major counter-offensive in the Russian-occupied south, apparently focused on the city of Kherson, west of Zaporizhzhia, and that it has already retaken dozens of villages.\n\nIn Washington, the Pentagon stepped up its military aid commitments to Ukraine, pledging $1bn (\u20ac980m) of further security assistance, including munitions for long-range weapons.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry meanwhile told the US it was suspending inspections under their START nuclear arms control treaty, though it said Moscow remained committed to the treaty's provisions.\n\nAdding weight to a rare diplomatic success since the war began, a deal to unblock Ukraine's food exports and ease global shortages gathered pace as two grain ships carrying almost 59,000 tonnes of corn and soybeans sailed out of Ukrainian Black Sea ports.\n\nThat raised the total to 12 since the first vessel left a week ago.\n\nThe July 22 grain export pact, brokered by

They were sailing under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to try to help ease soaring global food prices that have resulted from the war.\n\nBefore Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion, which Russian President Vladimir Putin calls a \"special military operation\", Russia and Ukraine together accounted for nearly a third of global wheat exports. The disruption since then has threatened famine in some parts of the world.\n\nPutin's troops are trying to gain full control of the Donbas region of east Ukraine where pro-Moscow separatists seized territory after the Kremlin annexed Crimea to the south in 2014.\n\n\"Ukrainian soldiers are firmly holding the defence, inflicting losses on the enemy and are ready for any changes in the operational situation,\" Ukraine's general staff said in an update on Monday.\n\nRussian forces stepped up their attacks north and northwest of Donetsk city in the Donbas on Sunday, Ukraine's military said. The Russians attacked Ukrainian positions near the heavily fortified settlements of Piski and Avdiivka, as well as shelling other locations in the Donetsk region, it said.\n\nIn addition to tightening its grip over the Donbas, Russia is entrenching its position in southern Ukraine, where it has gathered troops in a bid to prevent a potential counter-offensive near Kherson, Kyiv has said.\n\nAs the fighting rages, Russians installed in the wake of Moscow's invasion have toyed with the idea of joining Ukraine's occupied territory to Russia. Last month, a senior pro-Russian official said a referendum on such a move was likely \"towards next year.\"\n\nZelenskiy said any \"pseudo-referendums\" on occupied areas of his country joining Russia would eliminate the possibility of talks between Moscow and its Ukrainian counterparts or their allies.\n\n\"They will close for themselves any change of talks with Ukraine and the free world which the Russian side will clearly need at some point,\" he said.\n\nUkraine's chief war crimes prosecutor on Sunday said almost 26,000 suspected war crimes committed since the invasion were being investigated, with 135 people charged, of whom 15 were in custody.

Firefighters said they were prevented from reaching the blaze for hours.\n\nEnergoatom initially shut off two of the reactors -- and more recently a third -- but the plant has continued to be operated by Ukrainian technicians under Russian control.\n\nThe IAEA has repeatedly said it wants to organise an inspection of the plant.\n\nThis was initially opposed by Ukrainian authorities but officials have sounded less adamant about the prospect recently.\n\n- Renewed fighting -\n\nUkraine on July 21 accused Moscow of storing heavy weapons at the plant after Russia said Ukraine's troops had fired on the facility.\n\nEnergoatom said Russia had moved over two dozen pieces of military equipment and ammunition into the engine room of the first reactor.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Moscow was using it as a \"military base to fire at Ukrainians, knowing that they can't and won't shoot back\".\n\nOn August 5, Ukraine accused Russian forces of carrying out strikes near a reactor. Russia said Ukraine was behind them.\n\nFollowing the attacks, Energoatom said it would have to shut down another reactor because of damage to a power cable.\n\nAnother reactor is being repaired, meaning only two reactors are now functioning.\n\nUkraine says there are around 500 Russian troops at the plant and has called for the establishment of a demilitarised zone.\n\nDespite the tensions, Energoatom has said it is still in contact with the plant and receives data on radiation monitoring.\n\nIt said on Monday that there had been no change to radiation levels.\n\nKremlin accuses Kyiv of shelling nuclear plant\n\nKyiv, Ukraine (AFP) Aug 8, 2022 - The Kremlin accused Ukrainian forces Monday of firing on Europe's largest nuclear power plant in occupied Ukraine and warned the alleged attacks could have \"catastrophic consequences\".\n\nKyiv said Moscow was responsible and called for the area to be demilitarised, adding that two employees had been wounded in recent attacks.\n\nFighting continued meanwhile along battle lines stretching across eastern Ukraine, and Russia continued its crackdown on dissent at home.\n\nEach side has blamed the other for the escalation in fighting around the nuclear facility in Zaporizhzhia in southeastern Ukraine, which was captured by Russian forces soon after their late February invasion.\n\nRecent fighting at the plant has prompted the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to warn of \"the very real risk of a nuclear disaster\".\n\nUkraine said the plant should be cleared of Russian forces and called for the establishment of an international security and energy team to oversee the site.\n\n\"What needs to be done is to remove occupying forces from the station and to create a de-militarised zone on the territory of the station,\" said Petro Kotin, president of Ukraine's nuclear energy company, Energoatom.\n\n\"There should be a peacekeeping mission including experts from the IAEA and other security organisations,\" he added.\n\n\"Their presence and initially giving control to them and then to the Ukrainian side would have solved this problem\".\n\n- 'Nuclear terrorism' -\n\nKotin said Russia had deployed some 500 Russian troops and 50 pieces of hardware including tanks at Zaporizhzhia, echoing earlier claims from Kyiv that Moscow was using the site for military cover.\n\nUkraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmygal meanwhile accused Russia of \"nuclear terrorism,\" urging the world to \"unite now to prevent a catastrophe\".\n\nThe Kremlin has captured swathes of Ukrainian territory since February, introducing Russian currency and announcing plans to formally annex the areas by holding votes, including in the Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nThe head of its Moscow-installed administration Yevgeny Balitsky said on social media Monday he had signed a decree \"on the issue of organising a referendum on the reunification of the Zaporizhzhia region with the Russian Federation\".\n\nThe plans follow a similar move by Moscow in 2014 after it annexed the Crimean peninsula, a highly controversial vote that has not been recognised by most Western countries.\n\nAlthough attention was focused on the fallout from fighting at Zaporizhzhia, Russian forces continued shelling across the sprawling eastern frontline.\n\nAmong the attacks, Ukraine said one woman had died and four more were injured in Russian bombardments on Kharkiv region in the northeast. It has been under persistent Russian shelling for weeks.\n\nUkrainian forces in turn said they had bombed a strategic bridge over the Dnipro river overnight in the Russian-held city of Kherson in the south.\n\nMore than five months of fighting has taken a heavy toll on Russian forces, with up to 80,000 of Moscow's troops killed or wounded and 3-4,000 armoured vehicles lost, a senior Pentagon official said Monday.\n\nThere were also fresh pledges of Western aid.\n\nThe Pentagon announced military aid for Ukraine worth $1 billion including additional precision ammunition for the Himars system that has helped Kyiv's forces attack Russian troops far behind the front lines.\n\nThe World Bank said it was mobilising another $4.5 billion in US-provided financial support to help Kyiv pay for services and pensions, key to easing the invasion's economic impacts.\n\nBut the United Nations said Monday that more than 17 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance due to the Ukraine conflict, and increased an appeal for funds to respond to the crisis from $2.25 billion to $4.3 billion.\n\n- Fresh fine for journalist -\n\nThe authorities in Moscow pursued their crackdown on opposition to the war, handing down a new fine to journalist Marina Ovsyannikova.\n\nOvsyannikova shot to prominence in March for interrupting a live broadcast to denounce Russia's military intervention in Ukraine.\n\nOn Monday, her lawyer did not rule out the possibility of her facing another criminal probe.\n\nA Ukrainian court meanwhile jailed a Russian tank crewman for 10 years for firing on a multi-storied apartment block in the northern city of Chernigiv early on in the invasion, the security services (SBU) announced Monday.\n\nThe Chernigiv court convicted sergeant Mikhail Kulikov of a war crime.\n\nThe SBU also said it arrested Russian agents who were planning to assassinate the defence minister and the military intelligence chief.\n\nThere was progress on one rare area of compromise between Russian and Ukraine Monday, after the first cargo ship that left a Ukrainian port reached its final destination under a recent deal brokered by Ankara and the UN docked in Turkey.\n\nWhile Kyiv welcomed the news, officials also said there was a delay in the first delivery to leave Ukrainian ports because the buyer had refused delivery, citing a five-month delay in shipment.\n\nInfrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on social media that a cargo ship carrying grain had departed for the first time from the Black Sea port of Pivdennyi.", "source": {"uri": "nuclearpowerdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nuclear Power Daily"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.spxdaily.com/images-hg/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-hg.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 16, "stanza_neu": 43, "stanza_pos": 5, "swn_neg": 64, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144531061", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "23:47:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T23:47:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T23:47:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "url": "https://www.voazimbabwe.com/a/6693470.html", "title": "UN Chief Calls for Access to Ukraine Nuclear Plant After New Attack", "body": "U.N.

Russia claimed that Ukrainian shelling caused a power surge and fire and forced staff to lower output from two reactors, while Ukraine has blamed Russian troops for storing weapons there.\n\nNuclear experts have warned that more shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which was captured by Russia early in the war, is fraught with danger.\n\nThe Kremlin echoed that Monday, claiming that Kyiv was attacking the plant and urging Western powers to force a stop to that.\n\n\"Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. \"It's fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for the entire Europe.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Previously, Ukrainian officials have said Russia is launching attacks from the plant and using Ukrainian workers there as human shields.\n\nYusov called on Russia to \"make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nUkraine's ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, likewise urged that the United Nations, the IAEA and the international community send a delegation to \"completely demilitarize the territory\" and provide security guarantees to plant employees and the city where the plant is based, Enerhodar.\n\nThe IAEA is the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog. Its director-general, Rafael Grossi, told The Associated Press last week that the situation surrounding the Zaporizhzhia plant \"is completely out of control,\" and issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to allow experts to visit the complex to stabilize the situation and avoid a nuclear accident.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced support for that idea Monday, saying, \"any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing.\"\n\nOne expert in nuclear materials at Imperial College London said the reactor at Zaporizhzhia is modern and housed inside a heavily reinforced steel-and-concrete building designed to protect against disasters.\n\n\"As such, I do not believe there would be a high probably of a breach of the containment building, even if it was accidently struck by an explosive shell, and even less likely the reactor itself could be damaged,\" said Mark Wenman at the college's Nuclear Energy Futures.\n\nHe also said the complex's spent fuel tanks, where the shells reportedly hit, are strong and probably don't contain much spent fuel.\n\n\"Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would be illegal according to international law, the likelihood of a serious nuclear release is still small,\" he said.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the attack Sunday caused a power surge and smoke, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished flames, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nAnd the head of the Ukrainian company operating the plant said all but one power line connecting it to Ukraine's energy system had been destroyed. Petro Kotin, head of the Ukrainian state corporation Eherhoatom, blamed Russian shelling and said a blackout would be \"very unsafe for such a nuclear facility.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy decried \"the shelling and mining\" of the plant and called it \"nuclear blackmail.\" He called for sanctions against Moscow's nuclear industry.\n\nAs fighting continued on the front lines, the United States on Monday pledged another $1 billion in new military aid for Ukraine. It would be the biggest delivery yet of rockets, ammunition and other arms straight from U.S. Department of Defense stocks for Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe latest announcement brings total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine by the Biden administration to $9.1 billion since Russian troops invaded on Feb. 24.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said the Russians had shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the previous 24 hours, killing five people. Among the targets, it said, was Nikopol, just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia plant. Thousands of people were without electricity there.\n\nRussian rockets and artillery also hit across the Sumy region, killing one person, and the Ukrainian governor of the eastern Donetsk region said the cities of Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Lyman had emerged as fighting hotspots.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south, officials there said, including the strategic Antonivskiy bridge in the southern city of Kherson. An artery for Russian military supplies, the bridge has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling. Plans to reopen it on Wednesday were now shelved, said Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the ships that left Ukraine on Friday under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis arrived in Turkey, the first loaded vessel to reach its destination.

They were sailing under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to try to help ease soaring global food prices that have resulted from the war.\n\nBefore Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion, which Russian President Vladimir Putin calls a \"special military operation\", Russia and Ukraine together accounted for nearly a third of global wheat exports. The disruption since then has threatened famine in some parts of the world.\n\nBattle for Donbas\n\nPutin's troops are trying to gain full control of the Donbas region of east Ukraine where pro-Moscow separatists seized territory after the Kremlin annexed Crimea to the south in 2014.\n\n\"Ukrainian soldiers are firmly holding the defence, inflicting losses on the enemy and are ready for any changes in the operational situation,\" Ukraine's general staff said in an update on Monday.\n\nRussian forces stepped up their attacks north and northwest of Donetsk city in the Donbas on Sunday, Ukraine's military said. The Russians attacked Ukrainian positions near the heavily fortified settlements of Piski and Avdiivka, as well as shelling other locations in the Donetsk region, it said.\n\nIn addition to tightening its grip over the Donbas, Russia is entrenching its position in southern Ukraine, where it has gathered troops in a bid to prevent a potential counter-offensive near Kherson, Kyiv has said.\n\nAs the fighting rages, Russians installed in the wake of Moscow's invasion have toyed with the idea of joining Ukraine's occupied territory to Russia. Last month, a senior pro-Russian official said a referendum on such a move was likely \"towards next year.\"\n\nZelenskiy said any \"pseudo-referendums\" on occupied areas of his country joining Russia would eliminate the possibility of talks between Moscow and its Ukrainian counterparts or their allies.\n\n\"They will close for themselves any change of talks with Ukraine and the free world which the Russian side will clearly need at some point,\" he said.\n\nUkraine's chief war crimes prosecutor on Sunday said almost 26,000 suspected war crimes committed since the invasion were being investigated, with 135 people charged, of whom 15 were in custody.

He contended that Russian forces, with the shelling of the nuclear facility, are trying to cause blackouts in southern Ukraine, where intense fighting is ongoing.\n\nIn his daily video address Monday evening, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for new Western sanctions on Russia's nuclear industry \"for creating the threat of a nuclear disaster.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Russia claimed that Ukrainian forces hit the site with a multiple rocket launcher, damaging administrative buildings and a storage area. The Russian Foreign Ministry accused Kyiv of attempting to \"take Europe hostage\" by shelling the plant.\n\nTsymbaliuk said, \"If something happens, so there will be huge consequences not only for Ukraine, probably all Ukraine will be contaminated, but for Europe as well.\"\n\nTsymbaliuk said Kyiv would use all the diplomatic channels it can to allow an international mission to the plant.\n\nRussia's RIA Novosti news agency said Moscow is ready to facilitate a visit of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the Zaporizhzhia plant.\n\nIn the most recent attack on the nuclear facility Saturday night, Ukraine's state nuclear power firm said Russian forces damaged three radiation sensors and wounded a worker with shrapnel.\n\nThe plant, in Russian-controlled territory, was also attacked Friday. Moscow has blamed Ukrainian forces for the strikes.\n\nRussia captured the Zaporizhzhia plant in early March in the opening stages of its invasion of Ukraine, but the facility is still run by Ukrainian technicians.\n\nThe Ukrainian nuclear company Energoatom said Russian rocket attacks Saturday hit a storage facility, where 174 containers with spent nuclear fuel were kept in the open.\n\n\"Consequently, timely detection and response in the event of a deterioration in the radiation situation or leakage of radiation from containers of spent nuclear fuel are not yet possible,\" it said.\n\nThe Russian-installed administration of occupied Enerhodar, where the plant's employees live, said Ukraine had struck using a 220-mm Uragan multiple rocket launcher system.\n\n\"The administrative buildings and the adjacent territory of the storage facility were damaged,\" it said.\n\nAfter the first attack Friday, the head of the IAEA said the shelling showed the risk of a nuclear disaster. Those shells hit a high-voltage power line, prompting the plant's operators to disconnect a reactor -- despite no radioactive leak being detected.\n\nProgress on grains\n\nMeanwhile, a ship carrying grains from Ukraine has arrived in Turkey, the first vessel to reach its destination under a deal to unblock grain supplies.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted, \"If Russia sticks to

sparked international fears of a Chernobyl-style disaster.\n\nFighting around the facility, located on the banks of the Dniper River, has intensified as Ukrainian forces battle to reclaim territories

for spent fuel at the plant.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said on Monday (local time) that Ukrainian attacks had damaged high-voltage power lines into the Soviet-era plant and forced it to reduce output by two of its six reactors to \"prevent disruption\".\n\nThe clashes prompted calls for the United Nation's atomic watchdog and international peacekeepers to be deployed on the ground to ensure the plant remains safe.\n\nIn his overnight address late on Sunday, President Zelenskyy said: \"There is no such nation in the world that can feel safe when a terrorist state fires at a nuclear plant.\n\n\"God forbid, if something irreparable happens, no-one will stop the wind that will spread the radioactive contamination.\"\n\nThe wartime leader proposed the introduction of sanctions on Russian nuclear energy and uranium exports as part of a possible Western response to \"the threat that Russia created by striking at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant\".\n\nThe invaders have forced the plant's Ukrainian technicians to remain working, in often violent conditions, at the facility in order to keep it running. The Russian-installed official in the Zaporizhzhia region said it was operating normally.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence chiefs on Monday accused Russia of mining energy units at the plant, according to the Interfax news agency.\n\nEnergoatom, Ukraine's state nuclear power firm, claimed Russia was \"openly blackmailing the whole world\" by threatening to detonate the explosives unless Ukraine hands over permanent control of the facility.\n\nLocal reports cited comments by Valery Vasiliev, Russia's Major General, which have since been deleted from pro-Kremlin channels on the Telegram messaging app, insisting \"there will be either Russian land or a scorched desert\".\n\nRussian forces are also using the fighting to try to cause power cuts in southern Ukraine, Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, the country's ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, said on Monday.\n\n\"Russian occupants aim to destroy the plant's infrastructure, cause damage to all transmission lines - and they are used to transport electricity to the Ukrainian grid - and to cause blackouts in the south of Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nAmid mounting fears of a nuclear catastrophe, Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, urged an end to the \"suicidal\" military operations around the plant.\n\nThe White House called on Russia on Monday to cease all military operations around nuclear facilities in Ukraine.\n\n\"Fighting near a nuclear plant is dangerous,\" Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House spokesman, told reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\nPetro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, called for a Western-backed peacekeeping mission to create a \"demilitarised zone\" around the facility.\n\n\"The decision that we demand from the world community and all our partners ... is to withdraw the invaders from the territory of the station and create a demilitarised zone on the territory of the station,\" he said.\n\n\"The presence of peacekeepers in this zone and the transfer of control of it

Rafael Grossi stressed the \"crucial importance\" of the agency being able to send a mission of safety, security and safeguards experts to the site.\n\nUkraine informed the IAEA that the shelling had damaged the facility's external power supply system, but that two power lines remained operational, Grossi said. The shelling had also triggered the emergency protection system of one of the station's three operating reactors. This unit was disconnected from the grid as a result of Friday's events, Ukraine said.\n\nUkraine said renewed Russian shelling on Saturday had damaged three radiation sensors and hurt a worker at station, the second hit in consecutive days on the site.\n\nRussian-installed authorities in the area said Ukrainian forces hit the site with a multiple rocket launcher, damaging administrative buildings and an area near a storage facility.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of waging \"nuclear terror\" that warranted more international sanctions, this time on Moscow's nuclear sector. \"There is no such nation in the world that could feel safe when a terrorist state fires at a nuclear plant,\" Zelenskiy said in a televised address on Sunday.\n\nOn social media Zelenskiy said he had talked with Charles Michel, president of the European council, and told him about the situation on the battlefield, in particular at Zaporizhzhia. \"Russian nuclear terror requires a stronger response from the international community - sanctions on the Russian nuclear industry and nuclear fuel.\"\n\nUkraine told the IAEA that there had been no damage to the reactors themselves, no radiological release and no reports of injuries. However, it said a nitrogen-oxygen station, which supports plant operations, and an auxiliary building were damaged. Firefighters had quickly extinguished a fire at the nitrogen-oxygen station, but it still needs to be repaired, Ukraine said. The IAEA said it has also received information about shelling near the spent fuel storage facility.\n\nOn Saturday morning, two of the station's six units were operating and the radiation situation was normal, Ukraine told the IAEA.\n\nBased on the limited information available, Mr Grossi said IAEA experts had made a preliminary assessment that the current nuclear safety and security situation at Zaporizhzhia seemed stable, with no immediate threat to nuclear safety.\n\nThe IAEA said it will continue to closely monitor the evolution of the situation, the progress of repairs and any nuclear safety implications at the site, he said.\n\nThe head of Ukraine's state nuclear power company Energoatom called for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to be made a military-free zone, warning of the risk of a Chernobyl-style nuclear disaster after the site was hit by shelling.\n\nPetro Kotin called for a team of peacekeepers to be deployed at the site. \"The decision that we demand from the world community and all our partners... is to withdraw the invaders from the territory of the station and create a demilitarised zone on the territory of the station,\" Mr Kotin said on television.\n\nEnergoatom said on Telegram that the periodic shelling of Zaporizhzhia by Russian troops with anti-aircraft missiles had caused \"a serious risk to the safe operation of the plant\".

Its director-general, Rafael Grossi, told The Associated Press last week that the situation surrounding the Zaporizhzhia plant \"is completely out of control,\" and issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to allow experts to visit the complex to stabilize the situation and avoid a nuclear accident.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced support for that idea Monday, saying, \"any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing.\"\n\nOne expert in nuclear materials at Imperial College London said the reactor at Zaporizhzhia is modern and housed inside a heavily reinforced steel-and-concrete building designed to protect against disasters.\n\n\"As such, I do not believe there would be a high probably of a breach of the containment building, even if it was accidently struck by an explosive shell, and even less likely the reactor itself could be damaged,\" said Mark Wenman at the college's Nuclear Energy Futures.\n\nHe also said the complex's spent fuel tanks, where the shells reportedly hit, are strong and probably don't contain much spent fuel.\n\n\"Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would be illegal according to international law, the likelihood of a serious nuclear release is still small,\" he said.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt.

Among the targets, it said, was Nikopol, just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia plant. Thousands of people were without electricity there.\n\nRussian rockets and artillery also hit across the Sumy region, killing one person, and the Ukrainian governor of the eastern Donetsk region said the cities of Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Lyman had emerged as fighting hotspots.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south, officials there said, including the strategic Antonivskiy bridge in the southern city of Kherson.

The area is now being targeted by Ukraine for a counter-offensive.\n\nKyiv appealed for the area around the plant to be demilitarised and for the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, to be let in. Russia's foreign ministry said it too favoured an IAEA visit, which it accused Ukraine of blocking while trying to \"take Europe hostage\" by shelling the plant.\n\nUkraine blamed Russia for weekend attacks around the complex, which is still being run by Ukrainian technicians. It said three radiation sensors were damaged and two workers injured by shrapnel.\n\nReuters could not verify either side's version of what happened.\n\nPetro Kotin, head of Ukraine's state nuclear power company Energoatom, called for peacekeepers to be deployed in and run the Zaporizhzhia site, with operational control handed back to Ukraine.\n\nHe flagged the danger of shells hitting containers of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel. If two or more were broken, it was \"impossible to assess the scale\" of the resulting disaster.\n\n\"Such insane actions could leave to the situation spiralling out of control and it will be a Fukushima or Chornobyl,\" Kotin said.\n\nDr Mark Wenman, a nuclear expert at Imperial College London, played down the risk of a major incident, saying the Zaporizhzhia reactors were relatively robust and the spent fuel well protected.\n\n\"Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would be illegal ...the likelihood of a serious nuclear release is still small,\" he said in a statement.\n\n'WORKING UNDER RUSSIAN GUNS'\n\nYevhenii Tsymbaliuk, Ukraine's ambassador to the IAEA, said Zaporizhzhia staff were \"working under the barrels of Russian guns\". He called for a U.N.-led mission to the Soviet-era plant this month.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry meanwhile said Ukrainian attacks had damaged power lines servicing the plant and forced it to reduce output by two of its six reactors to \"prevent disruption\".\n\nThe U.N.'s Guterres said IAEA personnel needed access to \"create conditions for stabilisation\".\n\n\"Any attack (on) a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,\" he told a news conference in Japan, where he attended the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony on Saturday to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing.\n\nThe world's worst civil nuclear disaster occurred in 1986 when a reactor at the Chornobyl complex in northwest Ukraine exploded. Soon after this year's Feb. 24 invasion, Russian troops occupied that site, withdrawing in late March.\n\nUkraine has said it is planning to conduct a major counter-offensive in the Russian-occupied south, apparently focused on the city of Kherson, west of Zaporizhzhia, and that it has already retaken dozens of villages.\n\nIn Washington, the Pentagon stepped up its military aid commitments to Ukraine, pledging $1 billion of further security assistance, including munitions for long-range weapons.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry meanwhile told the United States it was suspending inspection activities under their START nuclear arms control treaty, though it said Moscow remained committed to the treaty's provisions.\n\nGRAIN EXPORTS PICK UP\n\nAdding weight to a rare diplomatic success since the war began, a deal to unblock Ukraine's food exports and ease global shortages gathered pace as two grain ships carrying almost 59,000 tonnes of corn and soybeans sailed out of Ukrainian Black Sea ports.\n\nThat raised the total to 12 since the first vessel left a week ago.\n\nThe July 22 grain export pact, brokered by Turkey and the United Nations, was further underpinned as the parties issued procedures for merchant ships carrying Ukrainian grain, including a 10-nautical-mile military exclusion zone, according to a document seen by Reuters.\n\nBefore the invasion, Russia and Ukraine together accounted for nearly a third of global wheat exports.\n\nRussia says it is waging a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine to rid it of nationalists and protect Russian-speaking communities. Ukraine and the West describe Russia's actions as an unprovoked war of aggression.\n\nThe conflict has displaced millions, killed thousands of civilians and left cities, towns and villages in ruins.\n\nRussian forces are trying to gain full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region where pro-Moscow separatists seized territory after the Kremlin annexed Crimea to the south in 2014.\n\n\"Ukrainian soldiers are firmly holding the defence, inflicting losses on the enemy and are ready for any changes in the operational situation,\" Ukraine's general staff said in an operational update on Monday.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters bureaus; Writing by Stephen Coates, Mark Heinrich, John Stonestreet; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore, Nick Macfie, Peter Graff)", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6G0bFHrNUs.hkOUKh4t.3w--~B/aD01NTQ7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/6eaec9a1cacd2eba2179b62618e7707d", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 16, "stanza_neu": 18, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 37, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144481902", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "22:25:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T22:25:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T21:30:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7411764860153198, "url": "https://mooresvilletribune.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/russia-ukraine-trade-accusations-over-nuclear-plant-attacks/article_0c41b242-337d-543c-bffd-8a6e40f048bf.html", "title": "Russia, Ukraine trade accusations over nuclear plant attacks", "body": "By SUSIE BLANN - Associated Press\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia and Ukraine traded accusations Monday that each side is shelling Europe's biggest nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine.

Its director-general, Rafael Grossi, told The Associated Press last week that the situation surrounding the Zaporizhzhia plant \"is completely out of control,\" and issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to allow experts to visit the complex to stabilize the situation and avoid a nuclear accident.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced support for that idea Monday, saying, \"any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing.\"\n\nOne expert in nuclear materials at Imperial College London said the reactor at Zaporizhzhia is modern and housed inside a heavily reinforced steel-and-concrete building designed to protect against disasters.\n\n\"As such, I do not believe there would be a high probably of a breach of the containment building, even if it was accidently struck by an explosive shell, and even less likely the reactor itself could be damaged,\" said Mark Wenman at the college's Nuclear Energy Futures.\n\nHe also said the complex's spent fuel tanks, where the shells reportedly hit, are strong and probably don't contain much spent fuel.\n\n\"Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would be illegal according to international law, the likelihood of a serious nuclear release is still small,\" he said.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the attack Sunday caused a power surge and smoke, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished flames, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nAnd the head of the Ukrainian company operating the plant said all but one power line connecting it to Ukraine's energy system had been destroyed. Petro Kotin, head of the Ukrainian state corporation Eherhoatom, blamed Russian shelling and said a blackout would be \"very unsafe for such a nuclear facility.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy decried \"the shelling and mining\" of the plant and called it \"nuclear blackmail.\" He called for sanctions against Moscow's nuclear industry.\n\nAs fighting continued on the front lines, the United States on Monday pledged another $1 billion in new military aid for Ukraine. It would be the biggest delivery yet of rockets, ammunition and other arms straight from U.S. Department of Defense stocks for Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe latest announcement brings total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine by the Biden administration to $9.1 billion since Russian troops invaded on Feb. 24.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said the Russians had shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the previous 24 hours, killing five people. Among the targets, it said, was Nikopol, just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia plant. Thousands of people were without electricity there.\n\nRussian rockets and artillery also hit across the Sumy region, killing one person, and the Ukrainian governor of the eastern Donetsk region said the cities of Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Lyman had emerged as fighting hotspots.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south, officials there said, including the strategic Antonivskiy bridge in the southern city of Kherson. An artery for Russian military supplies, the bridge has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling. Plans to reopen it on Wednesday were now shelved, said Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the ships that left Ukraine on Friday under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis arrived in Turkey, the first loaded vessel to reach its destination.

Previously, Ukrainian officials have said Russia is launching attacks from the plant and using Ukrainian workers there as human shields.\n\nYusov called on Russia to \"make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nUkraine's ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, likewise urged that the United Nations, the IAEA and the international community send a delegation to \"completely demilitarize the territory\" and provide security guarantees to plant employees and the city where the plant is based, Enerhodar.\n\nThe IAEA is the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog. Its director-general, Rafael Grossi, told The Associated Press last week that the situation surrounding the Zaporizhzhia plant \"is completely out of control,\" and issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to allow experts to visit the complex to stabilize the situation and avoid a nuclear accident.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced support for that idea Monday, saying, \"any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing.\"\n\nOne expert in nuclear materials at Imperial College London said the reactor at Zaporizhzhia is modern and housed inside a heavily reinforced steel-and-concrete building designed to protect against disasters.\n\n\"As such, I do not believe there would be a high probably of a breach of the containment building, even if it was accidently struck by an explosive shell, and even less likely the reactor itself could be damaged,\" said Mark Wenman at the college's Nuclear Energy Futures.\n\nHe also said the complex's spent fuel tanks, where the shells reportedly hit, are strong and probably don't contain much spent fuel.\n\n\"Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would be illegal according to international law, the likelihood of a serious nuclear release is still small,\" he said.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the attack Sunday caused a power surge and smoke, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished flames, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nAnd the head of the Ukrainian company operating the plant said all but one power line connecting it to Ukraine's energy system had been destroyed. Petro Kotin, head of the Ukrainian state corporation Eherhoatom, blamed Russian shelling and said a blackout would be \"very unsafe for such a nuclear facility.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy decried \"the shelling and mining\" of the plant and called it \"nuclear blackmail.\" He called for sanctions against Moscow's nuclear industry.\n\nAs fighting continued on the front lines, the United States on Monday pledged another $1 billion in new military aid for Ukraine. It would be the biggest delivery yet of rockets, ammunition and other arms straight from U.S. Department of Defense stocks for Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe latest announcement brings total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine by the Biden administration to $9.1 billion since Russian troops invaded on Feb. 24.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said the Russians had shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the previous 24 hours, killing five people. Among the targets, it said, was Nikopol, just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia plant. Thousands of people were without electricity there.\n\nRussian rockets and artillery also hit across the Sumy region, killing one person, and the Ukrainian governor of the eastern Donetsk region said the cities of Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Lyman had emerged as fighting hotspots.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south, officials there said, including the strategic Antonivskiy bridge in the southern city of Kherson. An artery for Russian military supplies, the bridge has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling. Plans to reopen it on Wednesday were now shelved, said Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the ships that left Ukraine on Friday under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis arrived in Turkey, the first loaded vessel to reach its destination. The Turkey-flagged Polarnet was laden with 12,000 tons of corn.\n\n\"This sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Ukraine won't abandon you,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. \"If Russia sticks to its obligations, the 'grain corridor' will keep maintaining global food security.\"\n\nTwelve ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- 10 outbound and two inbound. Some 322,000 metric tons of agricultural products have left Ukrainian ports, the bulk of it corn but also sunflower oil and soya.\n\nFour ships that left Ukraine on Sunday were expected to anchor near Istanbul on Monday evening for inspection to make sure they are carrying only food.\n\nThe first cargo ship to leave Ukraine, the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, which left Odesa on Aug. 1, hit a snag with delivery, however. It was heading for Lebanon with 26,000 metric tons of corn for chicken feed but the corn's buyer in Lebanon refused to accept the cargo, since it was delivered much later than its contract, Ukraine's embassy in Beirut said.\n\nKareem Chehayeb in Beirut, Mehmet Guzel in Derince, Turkey, and Andrew Wilks in Istanbul contributed.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

August. 09, 2022 07:50. by Eun-A Cho achim@donga.com.\n\nAs Ukraine and Russia are engaging in warfare in Zaporizhzhia in southeastern Ukraine where the largest nuclear power plant of Europe is located, concerns about the safety of the nuclear power plant are being raised. The Russian forces that seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in early March this year right after their invasion of Ukraine are using the power plant as a sort of shield as the Ukrainian forces began counterattacks in the south. As Russian forces were also deployed to Kherson, a city near Zaporizhzhia, the possibility of radiation leakage cannot be excluded when the battle intensified.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was under heavy attacks on Saturday and Sunday, which resulted in the injury of a person and damage to three radiation detection monitors. \"Russian nuclear terror,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it on Twitter on Monday. \"More international sanctions are warranted on Russia's nuclear sector,\" he said. However, Russia claimed that Ukraine's launch of multiple rockets is what damaged the facilities.\n\nAs conflicts between the two countries worsen, international concerns are growing. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that attacking a nuclear power plant is a suicide attempt. Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Rafael Grossi also said that the incident underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster.\n\nThe two countries are also moving to the south after fierce battles in Donbas in eastern Ukraine. The U.K. Ministry of Defence said on Saturday that Russian trucks, tanks, and cannons are moving from Donbas to southwestern Ukraine, making the 350 kilometers from Zaporizhzhia to Kherson a new battlefield. The ministry also added that more Russian forces are being added in the Crimean Peninsula and Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "donga.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.donga.com"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://dimg.donga.com/ugc/CDB/ENGLISH/Article/62/f1/93/1a/62f1931a0d0dd2738245.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 3, "stanza_neu": 11, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 15, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144786721", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-09", "time": "06:20:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-09T06:20:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-09T06:19:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "url": "https://www.stabroeknews.com/2022/08/09/news/world/ukraine-says-its-troops-advance-towards-izium-as-fighting-rages-in-donbas/", "title": "Ukraine says its troops advance towards Izium as fighting rages in Donbas - Stabroek News", "body": "KYIV, (Reuters) - Ukraine reported intense Russian shelling across the frontlines yesterday as both sides traded blame for the weekend strike on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex which triggered international concern about a potential atomic disaster.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported in frontline towns near the eastern city of Donetsk, where Ukrainian officials said Russian troops were launching waves of attacks as they try to seize control of the industrialised Donbas region.\n\n\"The situation in the region is tense - shelling is constant throughout the front line ...

Previously, Ukrainian officials have said Russia is launching attacks from the plant and using Ukrainian workers there as human shields.\n\nYusov called on Russia to \"make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nUkraine's ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, likewise urged that the United Nations, the IAEA and the international community send a delegation to \"completely demilitarize the territory\" and provide security guarantees to plant employees and the city where the plant is based, Enerhodar.\n\nThe IAEA is the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog. Its director-general, Rafael Grossi, told The Associated Press last week that the situation surrounding the Zaporizhzhia plant \"is completely out of control,\" and issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to allow experts to visit the complex to stabilize the situation and avoid a nuclear accident.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced support for that idea Monday, saying, \"any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing.\"\n\nOne expert in nuclear materials at Imperial College London said the reactor at Zaporizhzhia is modern and housed inside a heavily reinforced steel-and-concrete building designed to protect against disasters.\n\n\"As such, I do not believe there would be a high probably of a breach of the containment building, even if it was accidently struck by an explosive shell, and even less likely the reactor itself could be damaged,\" said Mark Wenman at the college's Nuclear Energy Futures.\n\nHe also said the complex's spent fuel tanks, where the shells reportedly hit, are strong and probably don't contain much spent fuel.\n\n\"Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would be illegal according to international law, the likelihood of a serious nuclear release is still small,\" he said.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the attack Sunday caused a power surge and smoke, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished flames, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nAnd the head of the Ukrainian company operating the plant said all but one power line connecting it to Ukraine's energy system had been destroyed. Petro Kotin, head of the Ukrainian state corporation Eherhoatom, blamed Russian shelling and said a blackout would be \"very unsafe for such a nuclear facility.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy decried \"the shelling and mining\" of the plant and called it \"nuclear blackmail.\" He called for sanctions against Moscow's nuclear industry.\n\nAs fighting continued on the front lines, the United States on Monday pledged another $1 billion in new military aid for Ukraine. It would be the biggest delivery yet of rockets, ammunition and other arms straight from U.S. Department of Defense stocks for Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe latest announcement brings total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine by the Biden administration to $9.1 billion since Russian troops invaded on Feb. 24.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said the Russians had shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the previous 24 hours, killing five people. Among the targets, it said, was Nikopol, just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia plant. Thousands of people were without electricity there.\n\nRussian rockets and artillery also hit across the Sumy region, killing one person, and the Ukrainian governor of the eastern Donetsk region said the cities of Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Lyman had emerged as fighting hotspots.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south, officials there said, including the strategic Antonivskiy bridge in the southern city of Kherson. An artery for Russian military supplies, the bridge has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling. Plans to reopen it on Wednesday were now shelved, said Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the ships that left Ukraine on Friday under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis arrived in Turkey, the first loaded vessel to reach its destination. The Turkey-flagged Polarnet was laden with 12,000 tons of corn.\n\n\"This sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Ukraine won't abandon you,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. \"If Russia sticks to its obligations, the 'grain corridor' will keep maintaining global food security.\"\n\nTwelve ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- 10 outbound and two inbound. Some 322,000 metric tons of agricultural products have left Ukrainian ports, the bulk of it corn but also sunflower oil and soya.\n\nFour ships that left Ukraine on Sunday were expected to anchor near Istanbul on Monday evening for inspection to make sure they are carrying only food.\n\nThe first cargo ship to leave Ukraine, the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, which left Odesa on Aug. 1, hit a snag with delivery, however. It was heading for Lebanon with 26,000 metric tons of corn for chicken feed but the corn's buyer in Lebanon refused to accept the cargo, since it was delivered much later than its contract, Ukraine's embassy in Beirut said.\n\nKareem Chehayeb in Beirut, Mehmet Guzel in Derince, Turkey, and Andrew Wilks in Istanbul contributed.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Its director-general, Rafael Grossi, told The Associated Press last week that the situation surrounding the Zaporizhzhia plant \"is completely out of control,\" and issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to allow experts to visit the complex to stabilize the situation and avoid a nuclear accident.\n\nU.N.

Among the targets, it said, was Nikopol, just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia plant. Thousands of people were without electricity there.\n\nRussian rockets and artillery also hit across the Sumy region, killing one person, and the Ukrainian governor of the eastern Donetsk region said the cities of Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Lyman had emerged as fighting hotspots.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south, officials there said, including the strategic Antonivskiy bridge in the southern city of Kherson. An artery for Russian military supplies, the bridge has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling.

Russia claimed that Ukrainian shelling caused a power surge and fire and forced staff to lower output from two reactors, while Ukraine has blamed Russian troops for storing weapons there.\n\nNuclear experts have warned that more shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which was captured by Russia early in the war, is fraught with danger. The Kremlin echoed that statement Monday, claiming that Ukrainian shelling could create \"catastrophic\" consequences for Europe.\n\nRafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has warned that the way the plant was being run under Russian forces and the fighting going on around it are posing grave health and environmental threats.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence chief, Andriy Yusov, countered the Russian statements by saying his organization had received credible information from several sources that Russian forces have planted explosives at the Zaporizhzhia plant to head off an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive in the region. Previously, Ukrainian officials have said Russia is launching attacks from the plant and using its Ukrainian workers as human shields.\n\nBefore Sunday's shelling, the nuclear plant came under fire last week and each side accused the other of the attack.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Monday that the Ukrainian attack a day earlier at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant caused a power surge and smoke erupted at its switch facility, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished the fire, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged Western powers to force Kyiv to stop attacking the plant.\n\n\"Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous,\" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. \"It's fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for the entire Europe.\"\n\nBut Yusov, Ukraine's military intelligence chief, said Monday: \"We have seen the Russian shelling of the Ukrainian nuclear power plant.\"\n\nHe added that, \"If it's not so, if it doesn't conform to reality, the Russians can make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA, if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nYusov said the Russians used similar tactics at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant when they had occupied it early in the war.\n\n\"This is a strategy of terror and scorched earth used by the Russians ahead of an inevitable Ukrainian counteroffensives in the south,\" he said.\n\nOn the high seas, meanwhile, the first of the ships to leave Ukraine under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis has arrived in Turkey. The Turkey-flagged Polarnet docked at the port of Derince in the Gulf of Izmit after setting off from the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk on Friday laden with 12,000 tons of corn.\n\n\"This sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Ukraine won't abandon you,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. \"If Russia sticks to its obligations, the 'grain corridor' will keep maintaining global food security.\"\n\nYet Polarnet Captain Ahmet Yucel Alibeyler highlighted the risks faced by grain-carrying ships trying to cross the Black Sea.\n\n\"These were, of course, dangerous areas, corridors that had been cleared, demined,\" he said.\n\nOn the front lines of the war, the Kremlin reasserted Monday that Russia will keep up its military attacks on Ukraine until it achieves its goals.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said Monday that the Russian military shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the past 24 hours, killing five people and wounding 20 more.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south of the country overnight, local officials said, again hitting a strategic bridge in the southern city of Kherson.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol, a Russian-controlled city in the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region, said Ukrainian forces used U.S. HIMARS rocket launchers to shell several facilities where the Russian military was stationed. Mayor Ivan Fyodorov said on Telegram that some 100 Russian troops were killed. His claims could not be independently verified, and the Russian military did not immediately comment.\n\nKirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region, said Monday morning that Ukrainian shelling again damaged the Antonivskiy bridge over the Dnieper River.\n\nThe bridge, a key artery for Russian military supplies, has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling and plans to reopen it on Wednesday were shelved due to the latest attack, Stremousov said.\n\nRussian forces also kept shelling Nikopol, a city just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine's presidential office said. Nikopol's gas pipelines, plumbing and power lines are no longer functioning, and thousands of people are left without electricity.\n\nA total of 12 ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- ten outbound and two headed for Ukraine. Some 322,000 metric tons of agricultural products have left Ukrainian ports, the bulk of it corn but also sunflower oil and soya.\n\nFour ships that left Ukraine on Sunday are expected to anchor near Istanbul on Monday evening and be inspected on Tuesday to make sure they are carrying only food items south and no weapons into Ukraine.\n\nBut the grain deal remains far from plain sailing. The first cargo ship to leave Ukraine, the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, left Odessa on Aug. 1 heading for Lebanon with 26,000 metric tons of corn for chicken feed. But it has run into a business dispute and will no longer dock in Lebanon, the Tripoli port chief told The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nUkraine's embassy in Beirut tweeted Monday that the corn's final buyer in Lebanon refused to accept the cargo due to the delivery delay beyond a contractual limit and that the shipper was now looking for another buyer for the corn.\n\nKareem Chehayeb in Beirut, Mehmet Guzel in Derince, Turkey, and Andrew Wilks in Istanbul contributed.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://chorus.stimg.co/23929575/merlin_68306011.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 15, "stanza_neu": 27, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 42, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144561001", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-09", "time": "00:43:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-09T00:43:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-09T00:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.729411780834198, "url": "https://omaha.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/russia-ukraine-trade-accusations-over-nuclear-plant-attacks/article_813ac000-7e17-527b-a5c8-7577378b825f.html", "title": "Russia, Ukraine trade accusations over nuclear plant attacks", "body": "By SUSIE BLANN - Associated Press\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia and Ukraine traded accusations Monday that each side is shelling Europe's biggest nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine.

Previously, Ukrainian officials have said Russia is launching attacks from the plant and using Ukrainian workers there as human shields.\n\nYusov called on Russia to \"make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nUkraine's ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, likewise urged that the United Nations, the IAEA and the international community send a delegation to \"completely demilitarize the territory\" and provide security guarantees to plant employees and the city where the plant is based, Enerhodar.\n\nThe IAEA is the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog. Its director-general, Rafael Grossi, told The Associated Press last week that the situation surrounding the Zaporizhzhia plant \"is completely out of control,\" and issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to allow experts to visit the complex to stabilize the situation and avoid a nuclear accident.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced support for that idea Monday, saying, \"any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing.\"\n\nOne expert in nuclear materials at Imperial College London said the reactor at Zaporizhzhia is modern and housed inside a heavily reinforced steel-and-concrete building designed to protect against disasters.\n\n\"As such, I do not believe there would be a high probably of a breach of the containment building, even if it was accidently struck by an explosive shell, and even less likely the reactor itself could be damaged,\" said Mark Wenman at the college's Nuclear Energy Futures.\n\nHe also said the complex's spent fuel tanks, where the shells reportedly hit, are strong and probably don't contain much spent fuel.\n\n\"Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would be illegal according to international law, the likelihood of a serious nuclear release is still small,\" he said.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the attack Sunday caused a power surge and smoke, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished flames, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nAnd the head of the Ukrainian company operating the plant said all but one power line connecting it to Ukraine's energy system had been destroyed. Petro Kotin, head of the Ukrainian state corporation Eherhoatom, blamed Russian shelling and said a blackout would be \"very unsafe for such a nuclear facility.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy decried \"the shelling and mining\" of the plant and called it \"nuclear blackmail.\" He called for sanctions against Moscow's nuclear industry.\n\nAs fighting continued on the front lines, the United States on Monday pledged another $1 billion in new military aid for Ukraine. It would be the biggest delivery yet of rockets, ammunition and other arms straight from U.S. Department of Defense stocks for Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe latest announcement brings total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine by the Biden administration to $9.1 billion since Russian troops invaded on Feb. 24.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said the Russians had shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the previous 24 hours, killing five people. Among the targets, it said, was Nikopol, just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia plant. Thousands of people were without electricity there.\n\nRussian rockets and artillery also hit across the Sumy region, killing one person, and the Ukrainian governor of the eastern Donetsk region said the cities of Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Lyman had emerged as fighting hotspots.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south, officials there said, including the strategic Antonivskiy bridge in the southern city of Kherson. An artery for Russian military supplies, the bridge has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling. Plans to reopen it on Wednesday were now shelved, said Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the ships that left Ukraine on Friday under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis arrived in Turkey, the first loaded vessel to reach its destination. The Turkey-flagged Polarnet was laden with 12,000 tons of corn.\n\n\"This sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Ukraine won't abandon you,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. \"If Russia sticks to its obligations, the 'grain corridor' will keep maintaining global food security.\"\n\nTwelve ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- 10 outbound and two inbound.

Credits: Video - AM; Images - Reuters\n\nInternational alarm over the weekend shelling of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex grew on Monday (local time), as Kyiv and Moscow traded blame for the attacks while seeking to address fears that their battle for control of the plant might trigger catastrophe.\n\nUnited Nations chief Antonio Guterres, calling any attack on a nuclear plant a \"suicidal thing\", demanded that UN nuclear inspectors be given access. The largest complex of its kind in Europe, Zaporizhzhia is situated in a southern region seized by Russian invaders in March and now targeted by Ukraine for a counter-offensive.\n\nKyiv appealed for the area to be demilitarised and for the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN's nuclear watchdog, to be let in. Russia's foreign ministry said it too favoured an IAEA visit, which it accused Ukraine of blocking while trying to \"take Europe hostage\" by shelling the plant.\n\nUkraine blamed Russia for weekend attacks in the area of the complex, which is still run by Ukrainian technicians. It said three radiation sensors were damaged, with two workers hospitalised with shrapnel injuries.\n\nReuters could not verify either side's version of what happened.\n\nPetro Kotin, head of Ukraine's state nuclear power company Energoatom, called for peacekeepers to be deployed in and run the Zaporizhzhia site, with operational control handed back to Ukraine.\n\nHe flagged the danger of shells hitting containers of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel as especially dire. If two or more containers were broken, \"it is impossible to assess the scale\" of the resulting disaster.\n\n\"Such insane actions could leave to the situation spiralling out of control and it will be a Fukushima or Chornobyl,\" Kotin said.\n\n'WORKING UNDER RUSSIAN GUNS'\n\nYevhenii Tsymbaliuk, Ukraine's ambassador to the IAEA, said Zaporizhzhia staff were \"working under the barrels of Russian guns\". He called for a UN-led international mission to the plant by the end of August and accused Russia of trying to cause blackouts along Ukraine's southern electricity grid by targeting the plant.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry meanwhile said Ukrainian attacks had damaged high-voltage power lines servicing the Soviet-era plant and forced it to reduce output by two of its six reactors to \"prevent disruption\".\n\nA Russian-installed official in the Zaporizhzhia region earlier said the facility was operating normally.\n\nThe UN's Guterres said IAEA personnel needed access to Zaporizhzhia to \"create conditions for stabilisation\".\n\n\"Any attack (on) a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,\" he told a news conference in Japan, where he attended the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony on Saturday to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing.\n\nThe world's worst civil nuclear disaster occurred in 1986 when a reactor at the Chornobyl complex in northwest Ukraine exploded. Soon after this year's Feb. 24 invasion Russian troops occupied that site, withdrawing from the area in late March.\n\nUkraine has said it is planning to conduct a major counter-offensive in the Russian-occupied south, apparently focused on the city of Kherson, west of Zaporizhzhia, and that it has already retaken dozens of villages.\n\nGRAIN EXPORTS PICK UP STEAM\n\nNearby, a deal to unblock Ukraine's food exports and ease global shortages gathered pace as two grain ships sailed out of Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Monday, raising the total to 12 since the first vessel left a week ago.\n\nThe two latest outgoing ships were carrying almost 59,000 tonnes of corn and soybeans and were bound for Italy and southeastern Turkey. The four that left on Sunday bore almost 170,000 tonnes of corn and other food.\n\nThe July 22 grain export pact brokered by Turkey and the United Nations represents a rare diplomatic triumph as fighting churns on in Ukraine. The deal aims to help ease soaring global food prices arising from the war.\n\nBefore the invasion, Russia and Ukraine together accounted for nearly a third of global wheat exports. The disruption since then has raised the spectre of famine in parts of the world.\n\nUkraine has said it hopes to export 20 million tonnes of grain in silos and 40 million from its new harvest to help rebuild its wrecked economy.\n\nRussia says it is waging a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine to rid it of nationalists and protect Russian-speaking communities. Ukraine and the West describe Russia's actions as an unprovoked imperial-style war to reassert control over a pro-Western neighbour lost when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991.\n\nThe conflict has displaced millions, killed thousands of civilians and left cities, towns and villages in ruins.\n\nRussian forces are trying to gain full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region where pro-Moscow separatists seized territory after the Kremlin annexed Crimea to the south in 2014.\n\n\"Ukrainian soldiers are firmly holding the defence, inflicting losses on the enemy and are ready for any changes in the operational situation,\" Ukraine's general staff said in an operational update on Monday.\n\nRussian forces stepped up attacks north and northwest of Russian-held Donetsk city in the Donbas on Sunday, Ukraine's military said.\n\nReuters", "source": {"uri": "newshub.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newshub"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@newshub.co.nz", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2022/08/ukraine-invasion-kyiv-moscow-trade-blame-for-nuclear-plant-attacks/_jcr_content/par/video/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1659981194256/Ukraine_Zaporizhzhia%2BNuclearPowerPlant_Reuters_1120.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 19, "stanza_neu": 19, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 40, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7143569300", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "07:01:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T07:01:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T07:00:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.729411780834198, "url": "https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/world/europe/un-demands-international-access-to-ukraine-nuclear-plant-after-attack-1659940531", "title": "UN demands international access to Ukraine nuclear plant after attack", "body": "UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Monday for international inspectors to be given access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after Ukraine and Russia traded accusations over the shelling of Europe's largest atomic plant at the weekend, reports Reuters.\n\n\"Any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,\" Guterres told a news conference in Japan, where he attended the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony on Saturday to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing.\n\nUkraine said renewed Russian shelling on Saturday had damaged three radiation sensors and hurt a worker at the Zaporizhzhia power plant, the second hit in consecutive days on the site.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of waging \"nuclear terror\" that warranted more international sanctions, this time on Moscow's nuclear sector.\n\n\"There is no such nation in the world that could feel safe when a terrorist state fires at a nuclear plant,\" Zelensky said in a televised address on Sunday.\n\nRussian forces captured the plant in southeastern Ukraine in early March but it is still run by Ukrainian technicians.\n\nThe Russian-installed authority of the area said Ukrainian forces hit the site with a multiple rocket launcher, damaging administrative buildings and an area near a storage facility. The Russian embassy in Washington also released a statement itemising the damage.\n\n\"Ukrainian nationalists launched an artillery strike on the territory of the specified object on Aug 5. Two high-voltage power lines and a water pipeline were damaged as a result of the shelling. Only thanks to the effective and timely actions of the Russian military in covering the nuclear power facility, its critical infrastructure was not affected,\" the embassy said.\n\nReuters could not verify either side's version.\n\nEvents at the Zaporizhzhia site - where Kyiv alleged that Russia hit a power line on Friday - have alarmed the world.\n\nGuterres said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) needed access to the plant.\n\n\"We fully support the IAEA in all their efforts in relation to create the conditions of stabilisation of the plant,\" Guterres said.\n\nIAEA chief Rafael Mariano Grossi warned on Saturday that the latest attack \"underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster\".\n\nElsewhere, a deal to unblock Ukraine's food exports and ease global shortages gathered pace as another four ships sailed out of Ukrainian Black Sea ports while the first cargo vessel since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion docked.\n\nThe four outgoing ships had almost 170,000 tonnes of corn and other food. They were sailing under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to try to help ease soaring global food prices that have resulted from the war.\n\nBefore Moscow's Feb 24 invasion, which Russian President Vladimir Putin calls a \"special military operation\", Russia and Ukraine together accounted for nearly a third of global wheat exports. The disruption since then has threatened famine in some parts of the world.\n\nBATTLE FOR DONBAS\n\nPutin's troops are trying to gain full control of the Donbas region of east Ukraine where pro-Moscow separatists seized territory after the Kremlin annexed Crimea to the south in 2014.\n\nRussian forces stepped up their attacks north and northwest of Donetsk city in the Donbas on Sunday, Ukraine's military said. The Russians attacked Ukrainian positions near the heavily fortified settlements of Piski and Avdiivka, as well as shelling other locations in the Donetsk region, it said.\n\nIn addition to tightening its grip over the Donbas, Russia is entrenching its position in southern Ukraine, where it has gathered troops in a bid to prevent a potential counter-offensive near Kherson, Kyiv has said.\n\nAs the fighting rages, Russians installed in the wake of Moscow's invasion have toyed with the idea of joining Ukraine's occupied territory to Russia. Last month, a senior pro-Russian official said a referendum on such a move was likely \"towards next year.\"\n\nIn his video address, Zelensky said that any \"pseudo-referendums\" on occupied areas of his country joining Russia would eliminate the possibility of talks between Moscow and its Ukrainian counterparts or their allies.\n\n\"They will close for themselves any change of talks with Ukraine and the free world which the Russian side will clearly need at some point,\" Zelensky said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Ukraine's chief war crimes prosecutor said almost 26,000 suspected war crimes committed since the invasion were being investigated, with 135 people charged, of whom 15 were in custody.

AP Photo/Khalil Hamra\n\nKYIV, Ukraine -- Russia and Ukraine traded accusations Monday that each side is shelling Europe's biggest nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. Russia claimed that Ukrainian shelling caused a power surge and fire and forced staff to lower output from two reactors, while Ukraine has blamed Russian troops for storing weapons there.\n\nNuclear experts have warned that more shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which was captured by Russia early in the war, is fraught with danger. The Kremlin echoed that statement Monday, claiming that Ukrainian shelling could create \"catastrophic\" consequences for Europe.\n\nRafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has warned that the way the plant was being run under Russian forces and the fighting going on around it are posing grave health and environmental threats.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence chief, Andriy Yusov, countered the Russian statements by saying his organization had received credible information from several sources that Russian forces have planted explosives at the Zaporizhzhia plant to head off an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive in the region. Previously, Ukrainian officials have said Russia is launching attacks from the plant and using its Ukrainian workers as human shields.\n\nBefore Sunday's shelling, the nuclear plant came under fire last week and each side accused the other of the attack.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Monday that the Ukrainian attack a day earlier at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant caused a power surge and smoke erupted at its switch facility, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished the fire, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged Western powers to force Kyiv to stop attacking the plant.\n\n\"Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous,\" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. \"It's fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for the entire Europe.\"\n\nBut Yusov, Ukraine's military intelligence chief, said Monday: \"We have seen the Russian shelling of the Ukrainian nuclear power plant.\"\n\nHe added that, \"If it's not so, if it doesn't conform to reality, the Russians can make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA, if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nYusov said the Russians used similar tactics at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant when they had occupied it early in the war.\n\n\"This is a strategy of terror and scorched earth used by the Russians ahead of an inevitable Ukrainian counteroffensives in the south,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the high seas, meanwhile, the first of the ships to leave Ukraine under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis has arrived in Turkey. The Turkey-flagged Polarnet docked at the port of Derince in the Gulf of Izmit after setting off from the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk on Friday laden with 12,000 tons of corn.\n\n\"This sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Ukraine won't abandon you,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. \"If Russia sticks to its obligations, the 'grain corridor' will keep maintaining global food security.\"\n\nYet Polarnet Captain Ahmet Yucel Alibeyler highlighted the risks faced by grain-carrying ships trying to cross the Black Sea.\n\n\"These were, of course, dangerous areas, corridors that had been cleared, demined,\" he said.\n\nOn the front lines of the war, the Kremlin reasserted Monday that Russia will keep up its military attacks on Ukraine until it achieves its goals.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said Monday that the Russian military shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the past 24 hours, killing five people and wounding 20 more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south of the country overnight, local officials said, again hitting a strategic bridge in the southern city of Kherson.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol, a Russian-controlled city in the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region, said Ukrainian forces used U.S. HIMARS rocket launchers to shell several facilities where the Russian military was stationed. Mayor Ivan Fyodorov said on Telegram that some 100 Russian troops were killed. His claims could not be independently verified, and the Russian military did not immediately comment.\n\nKirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region, said Monday morning that Ukrainian shelling again damaged the Antonivskiy bridge over the Dnieper River.\n\nThe bridge, a key artery for Russian military supplies, has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling and plans to reopen it on Wednesday were shelved due to the latest attack, Stremousov said.\n\nRussian forces also kept shelling Nikopol, a city just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine's presidential office said. Nikopol's gas pipelines, plumbing and power lines are no longer functioning, and thousands of people are left without electricity.\n\nA total of 12 ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- ten outbound and two headed for Ukraine. Some 322,000 metric tons of agricultural products have left Ukrainian ports, the bulk of it corn but also sunflower oil and soya.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour ships that left Ukraine on Sunday are expected to anchor near Istanbul on Monday evening and be inspected on Tuesday to make sure they are carrying only food items south and no weapons into Ukraine.\n\nBut the grain deal remains far from plain sailing. The first cargo ship to leave Ukraine, the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, left Odessa on Aug. 1 heading for Lebanon with 26,000 metric tons of corn for chicken feed. But it has run into a business dispute and will no longer dock in Lebanon, the Tripoli port chief told The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nUkraine's embassy in Beirut tweeted Monday that the corn's final buyer in Lebanon refused to accept the cargo due to the delivery delay beyond a contractual limit and that the shipper was now looking for another buyer for the corn.\n\n___\n\nKareem Chehayeb in Beirut, Mehmet Guzel in Derince, Turkey, and Andrew Wilks in Istanbul contributed.\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

The shelling did not damage the reactors themselves, but the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine said that the nitrogen-oxygen station and the combined auxiliary building were damaged. A high voltage power line was also damaged.\n\nAs a result, diesel generators were activated at one of the power units, which was disconnected from the power grid. Nuclear power plant operator Energoatom added that three radiation monitoring sensors were also damaged and said an area of 800 square metres was damaged near to the dry used nuclear fuel storage facility.\n\nZaporizhzhia has six reactors, making it the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. It has been under the control of Russian forces since the start of March, although it continues to be operated by its Ukrainian staff, and it continues to supply power to Ukraine. Most recently it had typically had three units operating.\n\nThe IAEA has been seeking to send a mission to the plant for months, but has not yet been able to, after failing to get the agreement of the two sides. Ukraine has said there cannot be an IAEA mission while the nuclear power plant is under Russian military control, and says that the best way to ensure nuclear safety is for the Russians to withdraw and return it to Ukrainian control.\n\nGrossi, who outlined his seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety early on in the conflict, said several pillars had been violated on Friday, adding: \"This must stop and stop now.\"\n\n\"In order to help prevent the situation from spiralling even more out of control, the IAEA's presence to provide technical support for nuclear safety and security is of paramount importance.\n\n\"Since the beginning of this tragic war, the IAEA - and I personally - has been working on supporting Ukraine in keeping all its nuclear facilities safe and secure.\n\n\"And for the last four months now, I have been ready to lead a mission of IAEA safety, security and safeguards experts to the country's biggest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzia.\n\n\"This mission would play a crucial role in helping to stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation there, as we have at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and elsewhere in Ukraine in recent months where we have also delivered nuclear safety and security equipment that is urgently needed.\n\n\"At the same time, IAEA safeguards inspectors would conduct essential verification activities at the plant. We would also provide impartial and independent information about the status of the Zaporizhzhia facility.\n\n\"That this vital mission has not yet happened is not because of the IAEA. Despite our determined efforts, it has not been possible, so far.\n\n\"I will not give up. I will continue to push - and push again - for this IAEA mission to finally take place.\n\n\"But this will need the cooperation, understanding and facilitation from both Ukraine and Russia.\n\n\"We will also need the United Nations to support us, and I'm very grateful for the steadfast support of UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.\"\n\nUN chief Guterres echoed the call for IAEA inspectors to be given access to the plant, adding that \"any attack on a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing\".\n\nBoth sides blame the other for the shelling. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of being a \"terrorist state\" which had \"fired at a nuclear plant\", while the Russian embassy in the USA said \"the shelling of Zaporizhzhia by the Ukrainian armed formations is deliberate ... in order to discredit Russia\".\n\nIn his statement, Grossi added: \"We can't afford to lose any more time ... we must all set aside our differences and act, now.\"", "source": {"uri": "world-nuclear-news.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Nuclear News (WNN)"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 12, "stanza_pos": 6, "swn_neg": 28, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144589177", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-09", "time": "01:31:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-09T01:31:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-09T01:31:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "url": "https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ukraines-energoatom-accuses-russia-of-nuclear-terrorism-amid-attack-on-zaporizhzhia-npp-articleshow.html", "title": "Ukraine's Energoatom accuses Russia of 'nuclear terrorism' amid attack on Zaporizhzhia NPP", "body": "\"Russian nuclear terror require stronger response from the international community, sanctions on the Russian nuclear industry and nuclear fuel,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nAs Ukrainian forces slammed Russia for openly blackmailing them by mining the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) Energoatom on its Telegram channel accused Moscow of \"nuclear terrorism.\" State Nuclear Regulation Board, as per the company, made a decision to recognise the actions of the Russian military at the ZNPP site and the placement of military equipment with ammunition, weapons and explosives directly next to nuclear installations an act of nuclear terrorism.\n\nThis came as Russian forces bombarded Europe's largest nuclear power with missiles that landed in the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant on Saturday night.

US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Russia was using the nuclear site as the \"equivalent of a human shield\" at a UN meeting on nuclear non-proliferation this week.\n\nUsing the plant in this way violates the Geneva Convention, which states that particular care must be taken if \"installations containing dangerous forces\" are located near fighting. Around 500 Russian troops are reported to be currently located at the site.\n\nWhen fighting first broke out in the vicinity of the plant in early March, it was the first time in the atomic age that war had come so close to a major facility.\n\nAfter Russian forces occupied the power plant in mid-March and allowed Ukrainian staff to carry on their work, news from Zaporizhzhia was intermittent.\n\nNow, however, concern is mounting again that the plant is not being sufficiently maintained.\n\n\"[It is a] violation of every possible nuclear safety measure that you can imagine,\" said Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in an interview with DW on July 29.\n\n\"Is it true that there is explosives and other material stocked near the reactors?\" he asked of reports that missiles and other weapons could be launched from the site, with counter-attack impossible due to the extreme threat of an accident.\n\nGrossi of the IAEA is also concerned that the Ukrainian staff who are under the command of the Russian occupiers at Zaporizhzhia are unable to properly carry out their duties and have faced threats of violence.\n\n\"I have been trying to put together a technical mission led by myself to go there to address a number of issues,\" he told DW. But access will be impossible without the accompaniment of UN peacekeepers, he said, a situation he is discussing with UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres.\n\nIn an interview with AP published on Tuesday, Grossi said the atomic energy agency has only \"patchy\" contact with staff at the site. He was also concerned that necessary equipment, including spare parts for maintenance of the reactors, was not being delivered due to interrupted supply chains.\n\n\"We are not sure the plant is getting all it needs,\" he said, adding that the situation is \"completely out of control.\"\n\nGreenpeace's Shaun Burnie agrees that it is vital that trained local staff maintain their positions and can work safely at the nuclear site. While Russia has more than twice as many reactors as Ukraine, most are older models, meaning their engineers don't have the expertise to run the newer technology in Zaporizhzhia, he said.\n\nLocal staff will also be needed in the event of the regular flooding from the Dnieper River, which flows through the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant and could damage the dams and reservoirs that provide the cooling water for the reactors.\n\nPetro Kotin, head of Ukraine's state-run nuclear power plant operator Energoatom, last week accused Russia of abducting up to 100 employees from Zaporizhzhia.\n\n\"Only some of these people then return to work with a broken psyche, making a statement that they love the Russian world because of the tortures that are applied to them by the invaders,\" Kotin said.\n\nBurnie is doubly concerned after a recent visit to survey the formerly Russian army-occupied Chernobyl nuclear plant, site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986.\n\nHis team discovered a contaminated exclusion zone riddled with landmines -- which stopped effective monitoring of the area. In addition, vital monitoring equipment in the Chernobyl plant had been destroyed, damaged or stolen during the Russian military occupation.\n\nMeanwhile, Energoatom's Petro Kotin has been calling for the liberation of the Zaporizhzhia plant from the Russian \"invaders,\" saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin is engaging in \"nuclear terrorism.\"", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.dw.com/image/61007168_6.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.4823529411764705, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 22, "stanza_neu": 10, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 33, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7143923316", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "12:24:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T12:24:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T12:24:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "url": "https://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2022/08/08/Ukraine-urges-for-the-de-militarization-of-nuclear-power-station", "title": "Ukraine calls for demilitarized zone around nuclear power station  | Al Arabiya English", "body": "Kyiv on Monday called for the establishment of a demilitarized zone around a nuclear power station in east Ukraine where recent fighting with Russian forces has raised fears of a nuclear accident.\n\nZaporizhzhia -- Europe's largest atomic power complex -- was occupied by Russia early in its invasion.\n\nFor all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\nIn recent days, it has been the scene of strikes that have damaged several structures, forcing the shutdown of a reactor.\n\n\"What needs to be done is to remove occupying forces from the station and to create a de-militarized zone on the territory of the station,\" said Petro Kotin, president of Ukraine's nuclear energy company, Energoatom.\n\n\"The fact that they are there is the greatest danger going forwards, towards an accident with radiation or even to a nuclear catastrophe,\" he added in a statement distributed by the agency.\n\nRecent fighting at the plant has prompted the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to warn of \"the very real risk of a nuclear disaster.\"\n\nPotin said in the statement that Russia had deployed some 500 Russian troops and 50 pieces of military hardware at Zaporizhzhia and that the situation at the plant marked a \"deterioration\" over recent day.\n\n\"That there should be a peacekeeping mission including experts from the IAEA and other security organizations.

Russia claimed that Ukrainian shelling caused a power surge and fire and forced staff to lower output from two reactors, while Ukraine has blamed Russian troops for storing weapons there.\n\nNuclear experts have warned that more shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which was captured by Russia early in the war, is fraught with danger. The Kremlin echoed that statement today, claiming that Ukrainian shelling could create \"catastrophic\" consequences for Europe.\n\nRafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has warned that the way the plant was being run under Russian forces and the fighting going on around it are posing grave health and environmental threats.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence chief, Andriy Yusov, countered the Russian statements by saying his organization had received credible information from several sources that Russian forces have planted explosives at the Zaporizhzhia plant to head off an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive in the region. Previously, Ukrainian officials have said Russia is launching attacks from the plant and using its Ukrainian workers as human shields.\n\nBefore Sunday's shelling, the nuclear plant came under fire last week and each side accused the other of the attack.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said today that the Ukrainian attack a day earlier at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant caused a power surge and smoke erupted at its switch facility, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished the fire, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged Western powers to force Kyiv to stop attacking the plant.\n\n\"Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous,\" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. \"It's fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for the entire Europe.\"\n\nBut Yusov, Ukraine's military intelligence chief, said today: \"We have seen the Russian shelling of the Ukrainian nuclear power plant.\"\n\nHe added that, \"If it's not so, if it doesn't conform to reality, the Russians can make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA, if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nYusov said the Russians used similar tactics at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant when they had occupied it early in the war.\n\n\"This is a strategy of terror and scorched earth used by the Russians ahead of an inevitable Ukrainian counteroffensives in the south,\" he said.\n\nOn the high seas, meanwhile, the first of the ships to leave Ukraine under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis has arrived in Turkey. The Turkey-flagged Polarnet docked at the port of Derince in the Gulf of Izmit after setting off from the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk on Friday laden with 12,000 tons of corn.\n\n\"This sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Ukraine won't abandon you,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. \"If Russia sticks to its obligations, the 'grain corridor' will keep maintaining global food security.\"\n\nYet Polarnet Captain Ahmet Yucel Alibeyler highlighted the risks faced by grain-carrying ships trying to cross the Black Sea.\n\n\"These were, of course, dangerous areas, corridors that had been cleared, demined,\" he said.\n\nOn the front lines of the war, the Kremlin reasserted today that Russia will keep up its military attacks on Ukraine until it achieves its goals.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said today that the Russian military shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the past 24 hours, killing five people and wounding 20 more.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south of the country overnight, local officials said, again hitting a strategic bridge in the southern city of Kherson.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol, a Russian-controlled city in the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region, said Ukrainian forces used U.S. HIMARS rocket launchers to shell several facilities where the Russian military was stationed. Mayor Ivan Fyodorov said on Telegram that some 100 Russian troops were killed. His claims could not be independently verified, and the Russian military did not immediately comment.\n\nKirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region, said this morning that Ukrainian shelling again damaged the Antonivskiy bridge over the Dnieper River.\n\nThe bridge, a key artery for Russian military supplies, has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling and plans to reopen it on Wednesday were shelved due to the latest attack, Stremousov said.\n\nRussian forces also kept shelling Nikopol, a city just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine's presidential office said. Nikopol's gas pipelines, plumbing and power lines are no longer functioning, and thousands of people are left without electricity.\n\nA total of 12 ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- ten outbound and two headed for Ukraine. Some 322,000 metric tons of agricultural products have left Ukrainian ports, the bulk of it corn but also sunflower oil and soya.\n\nFour ships that left Ukraine on Sunday are expected to anchor near Istanbul this evening and be inspected on Tuesday to make sure they are carrying only food items south and no weapons into Ukraine.\n\nBut the grain deal remains far from plain sailing. The first cargo ship to leave Ukraine, the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, left Odessa on Aug. 1 heading for Lebanon with 26,000 metric tons of corn for chicken feed. But it has run into a business dispute and will no longer dock in Lebanon, the Tripoli port chief told The Associated Press today.\n\nUkraine's embassy in Beirut tweeted today that the corn's final buyer in Lebanon refused to accept the cargo due to the delivery delay beyond a contractual limit and that the shipper was now looking for another buyer for the corn.", "source": {"uri": "tribtoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tribune Chronicle, Warren OH"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/ogden_images/www.tribtoday.com/images/2022/08/08104514/AP22220309773356-750x500.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 15, "stanza_neu": 27, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 42, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144766417", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-09", "time": "05:55:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-09T05:55:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-09T05:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/world/europe/2022/08/09/ukraine-reports-heavy-fighting-in-donbas-region-amid-intense-russian-shelling/", "title": "Ukraine reports heavy fighting in Donbas region amid intense Russian shelling", "body": "Ukraine reported intense Russian shelling across the frontlines on Tuesday.\n\nThe latest report comes as both sides in the conflict have traded blame for the weekend strike on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported in frontline towns near the eastern city of Donetsk, where Ukrainian officials said Russian troops were launching waves of attacks as they try to seize control of the industrialised Donbas region.\n\n\"The situation in the region is tense -- shelling is constant throughout the front line ...

The four that left on Sunday bore almost 170,000 tons of corn and other food.\n\nThe July 22 grain export pact brokered by Turkey and the United Nations represents a rare diplomatic triumph as fighting churns on in Ukraine and aims to help ease soaring global food prices arising from the war.\n\nBefore the invasion, Russia and Ukraine together accounted for nearly a third of global wheat exports. The disruption since then has raised the spectre of famine in parts of the world.\n\nUkraine has said it hopes to export 20 million tons of grain in silos and 40 million from its new harvest to help rebuild its wrecked economy.\n\nRussia says it is waging a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine to rid it of nationalists and protect Russian-speaking communities.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Monday for international inspectors to be given access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after Ukraine and Russia traded accusations over shelling of Europe's largest atomic complex at the weekend.\n\n\"Any attack (on) a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,\" Guterres told a news conference in Japan, where he attended the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony on Saturday to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing.\n\nDespite the shelling, the nuclear reactor complex was operating in \"normal mode\", Interfax news agency quoted Yevgeniy Balitsky, the Russian-installed head of the local administration, as saying on Monday.\n\nRussian forces captured the plant in Ukraine's southeast in early March, shortly after Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of its neighbour, but it is still run by Ukrainian technicians.\n\nUkraine blamed Russia for renewed shelling in the area of the plant on Saturday that had damaged three radiation sensors and injured a worker. It was the second reported hit on the plant in as many days, following damage to a power line.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a televised address on Sunday, accused Russia of waging \"nuclear terror\" that warranted more international sanctions, this time on Moscow's sprawling nuclear power sector.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia region's Russian-installed authority said Ukrainian forces hit the site with a multiple rocket launcher, damaging administrative buildings and a storage area.\n\nRussia's embassy in Washington itemised the damage, saying Ukrainian artillery damaged two high-voltage power lines and a water pipeline, but critical infrastructure was unaffected.\n\nReuters could not verify either side's version of what happened.\n\nUkraine has said it is planning to conduct a major counter-offensive in the Russian-occupied south, apparently focused on the city of Kherson, west of Zaporizhzhia, and that it has already retaken dozens of villages.\n\nArmed conflict near a Soviet-era nuclear power station has alarmed the world.\n\nGuterres said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) needed access to the plant. \"We fully support the IAEA in all their efforts in relation to creat(ing) the conditions for stabilisation of the plant,\" he said.\n\nIAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi warned on Saturday that the latest attack \"underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster\".\n\nGRAIN EXPORTS PICK UP STEAM\n\nElsewhere, a deal to unblock Ukraine's food exports and ease global shortages gathered pace as two grain ships sailed out of Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Monday, raising the total to 12 since the first vessel left a week ago.\n\nFour ships that left Ukraine on Sunday are expected to anchor near Istanbul on Monday evening, Turkey's defence ministry said, and would be inspected on Tuesday, while the first vessel to sail since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion docked.\n\nThe two latest outgoing ships were carrying almost 59,000 tonnes of corn and soybeans and were bound for Italy and southeastern Turkey following inspections. The four that left on Sunday bore almost 170,000 tonnes of corn and other food.\n\nThe July 22 grain export pact brokered by Turkey and the United Nations represents a rare diplomatic triumph as fighting churns on in Ukraine and aims to help ease soaring global food prices arising from the war.\n\nBefore Moscow's invasion, Russia and Ukraine together accounted for nearly a third of global wheat exports. The disruption since then has raised the spectre of famine in parts of the world.\n\nUkraine hopes to export 20 million tonnes of grain in silos and 40 million from its new harvest to help rebuild its shattered economy, the country's economic adviser, Oleh Ustenko, said in July.\n\nGRINDING BATTLE FOR DONBAS\n\nRussia says it is waging a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine to rid it of nationalists and protect Russian-speaking communities. Ukraine and the West describe Russia's actions as an unprovoked imperial-style war to reassert control over a pro-Western neighbour lost when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991.\n\nThe conflict has displaced millions, killed thousands of civilians and left cities, towns and villages in ruins.\n\nIt has evolved into a war of attrition concentrated in the east and south of Ukraine.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's forces are trying to gain full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region where pro-Moscow separatists seized territory after the Kremlin annexed Crimea to the south in 2014.\n\n\"Ukrainian soldiers are firmly holding the defence, inflicting losses on the enemy and are ready for any changes in the operational situation,\" Ukraine's general staff said in an operational update on Monday.\n\nRussian forces stepped up attacks north and northwest of Russian-held Donetsk city in the Donbas on Sunday, Ukraine's military said. It said the Russians pounded Ukrainian positions near the heavily fortified settlements of Piski and Avdiivka, as well as shelling other locations in Donetsk province.\n\nRussia is also trying to entrench its position in southern Ukraine, where it has been building up forces in a bid to fend off any counter-offensive near Kherson, Kyiv has said.\n\nInterfax quoted a Russian-appointed official in Kherson as saying on Monday Ukraine had again shelled the Antonivskyi bridge there, damaging construction equipment and delaying its reopening.\n\nThe bridge is one of only two crossing points for Russian forces to territory they have occupied on the western bank of the major Dnipro river in the south.\n\nIt has been a key Ukrainian target in recent weeks, with Kyiv using high-precision U.S.-supplied rockets to try to destroy it in possible preparation for a counter-attack.\n\nIn the northeast, one person was killed and one wounded by a Russian rocket strike on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, regional governor Oleh Synehubov wrote on Telegram.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters bureaus; Writing by Stephen Coates and Mark Heinrich; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore and Nick Macfie)\n\nTagsnews", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2OJfvw5lXOWHxkEXa9Xt0Q--~B/aD01NDM7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/6e772409e55979844797fae001077cf3", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.4666666666666667, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 27, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 41, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144369503", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "19:47:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T19:47:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T19:47:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/ukraine-calls-for-demilitarised-zone-around-nuclear-plant-hit-by-shelling/articleshow/93438312.cms", "title": "Ukraine calls for demilitarised zone around nuclear plant hit by shelling", "body": "The United Nations chief called for U.N. nuclear inspectors to be given access to the plant as Kyiv and Moscow traded blame for the shelling in a southern region seized by Russian invaders in March and now targeted by Kyiv for a counter-offensive.International alarm over weekend shelling attacks on Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex grew on Monday with Kyiv warning of the risk of a Chornobyl-style catastrophe and appealing for the area to be made a demilitarised zone.\n\nThe United Nations chief called for U.N. nuclear inspectors to be given access to the plant as Kyiv and Moscow traded blame for the shelling in a southern region seized by Russian invaders in March and now targeted by Kyiv for a counter-offensive.\n\n\"Any attack (on) a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,\" U.N.

If two or more containers were broken, \"it is impossible to assess the scale of this catastrophe\".\n\nThe world's worst civil nuclear disaster occurred in 1986 when a reactor at the Chornobyl complex in northwest Ukraine exploded.

But how dangerous is the situation and what is likely to happen next?\n\nThe plant, built in the Soviet era, is the largest nuclear reactor in Europe. Its six pressurised water reactors (of which at least two are currently operating) are important to Kyiv as they can produce power for up to 4m homes.\n\nSituated on the south bank of the Dnieper river at Enerhodar, south west of the city of Zaporizhzhia itself, the plant occupies an extremely important strategic position both for Russian and Ukrainian forces, who have been contesting control of the site since early in the war.\n\nThe presence of the water cooled reactors, as well as a spent fuel storage facility, on the large and sprawling site has led Russia to use it as a so called \"sheltered\" artillery park, using the facilities to fire on Ukrainian positions in the belief that Ukraine would not fire back and risk a nuclear accident.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken has accused the Russians of using the plant as a \"nuclear shield\" saying: \"Of course the Ukrainians cannot fire back lest there be a terrible accident involving the nuclear plant.\" That has allowed Russia to target areas like the city of Nikopol across the river which has come under heavy shelling in recent weeks.\n\nThere are two issues fuelling a deepening anxiety over the situation at the plant, which is under Russian control but uses Ukrainian staff. International nuclear safety officials have become concerned over the lack of spare parts, access for routine maintenance of the reactors and lack of contact with staff all of which have been disrupted by the ongoing conflict.\n\nA second issue is grad missile fire around the plant at the weekend, with Russians and Ukrainians pointing the finger over responsibility. According to Energoatom - the Ukrainian nuclear authority - the impacts were close to the spent fuel storage area with the operator claiming Russian troops \"aimed specifically\" at the containers despite the presence of Russian troops at the site.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that Ukrainian officials at times have somewhat overstated claims about nuclear risks posed by the conflict both at Chornobyl and Zaporizhzhia - so for now it is not clear how dangerous this weekend's incident was in and of itself.\n\nWhile Ukraine's objective - to see the plant treated as a demilitarised area - is an entirely prudent call it would also serve a military objective by denying Russian forces the use of a plant from which they can shell with relative impunity.\n\nA final dimension is a claim by Ukrainian intelligence - reported in Ukrainian media outlets - that Russia has mined facilities, quoting the head of the radiation, chemical and biological defence troops of the Russian armed forces, Maj Gen Valery Vasiliev, who now commands the Zaporizhzhia garrison, saying: \"There will be either Russian land or a scorched desert.\"\n\nHowever, a major and deliberate detonation in Zaporizhzhia would threaten southern Russia as well as Ukraine with nuclear contamination, so it is important to distinguish between \"nuclear blackmail\" and a serious threat that would have repercussions for Russia itself.\n\nThe reactors are designed to withstand substantial impact - think of a civilian airliner crashing into them - protected with steel and reinforced concrete as well as fire protection systems, although a strike from a substantial missile might be more problematic.\n\nThe buildings housing the spent fuel, however, are not built with a similar level of protection, meaning that a release of spent fuel material is probably a greater risk from fighting than a catastrophic breach of a reactor, although more limited.\n\nThe reality is that the ongoing situation at the plant in terms of safety operations is probably the most serious issue, as a deteriorating safety regime caused by the conflict has been exacerbated by a risk of a strike.\n\nThe head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, described the ongoing crisis of safety oversight as a dire threat to public health and the environment in Ukraine, and far beyond its borders, describing the situation as \"completely out of control.\"\n\n\"You have a catalogue of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility,\" he said. While Grossi has suggested a mission to the plant, ironically Ukraine has been blocking the initiative, with Energoatom arguing as recently as June that any visit would legitimise Russia's presence there.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_beaumont@theguardian.com", "name": "Peter Beaumont", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b271d25534f6a348eab897290557294a74e9f0db/0_102_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=90c90acf975ee1d683227889bbe3825f", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 8, "stanza_neu": 15, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 23, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144498030", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "22:48:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T22:48:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T22:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "url": "https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russia-and-ukraine-trade-accusations-after-nuclear-plant-strikes-204083", "title": "Russia and Ukraine Trade Accusations After Nuclear Plant Strikes", "body": "Ukrainian authorities said on Sunday that recent Russian shelling damaged three radiation sensors and injured a worker at the Zaporizhzhia power plant.\n\nUkrainian authorities said on Sunday that recent Russian shelling damaged three radiation sensors and injured a worker at the Zaporizhzhia power plant, according to Reuters.

The Ukrainian power plant was seized by Russian forces in early March.\n\nThe risk of nuclear catastrophe in Europe has returned, UN leaders warn, as the Russian army threatens to use Europe's largest nuclear power plant as a weapon of war and possible bargaining chip for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOfficials are now warning of a potential major disaster as clashes intensify at the sprawling Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, located in the eponymous southeastern Ukrainian province that has been under Russian occupation for months.\n\nLast week, the UN Nuclear Chief Rafael Grossi said that the plant was \"completely out of control\" and that \"every principle of nuclear safety has been violated\" amid growing reports of heavy artillery and the unknown safety status of the site's nuclear material.\n\nThe site has been under Russian occupation since March, shortly after the war began. Over the weekend, both Ukrainian and Russian forces accused each other of bombing the plant, putting its stores of volatile and radioactive nuclear material at risk.\n\nOn Monday, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called the attacks \"suicidal\" during a press conference in Japan, where he also reiterated international requests for Russia to allow an independent nuclear safety team to visit the plant and evaluate conditions.\n\n\"Any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,\" he said. \"I hope that those attacks will end.\"\n\nAfter videos emerged in early March of fires, explosions, and heavy shelling at Zaporizhzhia shortly after the plant's occupation, experts warned that it could lead to a nuclear catastrophe.\n\nIn April, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to cease the army's \"reckless actions\" at the plant which \"could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe.\"\n\nThose fears may be starting to become reality\n\nThe Russian forces occupying the plant, led by Major General Valery Vasiliev, have lined the power plants with mines and explosives, and are prepared to do what is necessary to keep hold of the site, according to a statement by Vasiliev, shared on the messaging app Telegram on Monday by Energatom, Ukraine's state-run nuclear energy operator.\n\n\"As you know, we have planted mines in all the important facilities of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. And we do not hide this from the enemy. We warned them. The enemy knows that the plant will be either Russian -- or no one's,\" the statement read.\n\n\"There will be either Russian land or a scorched desert,\" Vasiliev wrote. The statement was also cited Monday on Twitter by Ukraine's Stratcom Center, the source of strategic communications by the Ukrainian government. \"Scorched earth\" refers to a destructive military strategy used to devastate and destroy anything that might be later useful to an enemy combatant.\n\nEnergatom wrote that Ukrainian intelligence confirmed that the Zaporizhzhia plant has indeed been laced with mines by Russian troops, and said that the Russian army was prepared to \"blackmail the whole world\" by threatening the plant's safety.\n\nVasiliev warned that his troops -- who he referred to as \"liberators\" -- should be prepared to follow orders to detonate the plant should it be necessary.\n\n\"Warriors -- liberators should understand that there is no other option. And in case of receiving the most severe order, we must fulfill it with honor,\" he wrote.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is the largest of its kind in Europe, and a detonation at or near the site -- whether intentional or accidental -- could cause thousands of tons of highly radioactive nuclear fuel to leak out.\n\nThe site currently houses 2,204 tons of radioactive spent nuclear fuel, 855 of which are in more vulnerable spent fuel pools, according to a March Greenpeace analysis on the risks at the power plant.\n\nBut even spent nuclear fuel has a lot of pent-up energy. Without a constant flow of coolant to keep it from overheating, the radioactive material could evaporate and burn away its casing, releasing its toxic particles into the atmosphere. Greenpeace analysts warned this could happen at Zaporizhzhia, as the war is threatening to disrupt electrical supply to the plant, which is needed to power the systems that cool down the spent fuel.\n\n\"There is a unique nuclear threat,\" said Jan Vande Putte, a co-author of the analysis and nuclear analyst with Greenpeace, said of the risks at Zaporizhzhia in a March statement. \"For the first time in history a major war is being waged in a country with multiple nuclear reactors and thousands of tons of highly radioactive spent fuel.\"\n\nWith a war raging outside its walls, experts have warned about the possibility of electrical supply being cut off, which would make coolant systems at the plant inoperable. On Monday, the Russian Ministry of Defense said that it had to reduce the plant's output due to shelling sustained over the weekend on high-voltage power lines surrounding the site.\n\nRussia reportedly told diplomats on Monday that it would welcome international nuclear monitors to assess the safety of the plant, although the UN's Grossi has said that going there remains \"very complex\" and will require permission from the Ukrainian government and safe passage through the war zone surrounding the plant.\n\nUkrainian officials suggested on Monday turning the area around the plant into a demilitarized zone to assist in these efforts, although this would require Russian troops to leave the site.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1240384920.jpg?resize=1200,600", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 24, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 36, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144218545", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "16:52:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T16:52:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T15:03:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "url": "https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2022/08/08/amid-global-alarm-ukraine/", "title": "Amid global alarm, Ukraine, Russia trade blame for nuclear plant attacks", "body": "KYIV (Reuters) - International alarm over the weekend shelling of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex grew on Monday, as Kyiv and Moscow traded blame for the attacks while seeking to address fears that their battle for control of the plant might trigger catastrophe.\n\nUnited Nations chief Antonio Guterres, calling any attack on a nuclear plant a \"suicidal thing\", demanded that U.N. nuclear inspectors be given access. The largest complex of its kind in Europe, Zaporizhzhia is situated in a southern region seized by Russian invaders in March and now targeted by Ukraine for a counter-offensive.\n\nKyiv appealed for the area to be demilitarised and for the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, to be let in. Russia's foreign ministry said it too favoured an IAEA visit, which it accused Ukraine of blocking while trying to \"take Europe hostage\" by shelling the plant.\n\nUkraine blamed Russia for weekend attacks in the area of the complex, which is still run by Ukrainian technicians. It said three radiation sensors were damaged, with two workers hospitalised with shrapnel injuries.\n\nReuters could not verify either side's version of what happened.\n\nPetro Kotin, head of Ukraine's state nuclear power company Energoatom, called for peacekeepers to be deployed in and run the Zaporizhzhia site, with operational control handed back to Ukraine.\n\nHe flagged the danger of shells hitting containers of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel as especially dire. If two or more containers were broken, \"it is impossible to assess the scale\" of the resulting disaster.\n\n\"Such insane actions could leave to the situation spiralling out of control and it will be a Fukushima or Chornobyl,\" Kotin said.\n\n'WORKING UNDER RUSSIAN GUNS'\n\nYevhenii Tsymbaliuk, Ukraine's ambassador to the IAEA, said Zaporizhzhia staff were \"working under the barrels of Russian guns\". He called for a U.N.-led international mission to the plant by the end of August and accused Russia of trying to cause blackouts along Ukraine's southern electricity grid by targeting the plant.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry meanwhile said Ukrainian attacks had damaged high-voltage power lines servicing the Soviet-era plant and forced it to reduce output by two of its six reactors to \"prevent disruption\".\n\nA Russian-installed official in the Zaporizhzhia region earlier said the facility was operating normally.\n\nThe U.N.'s Guterres said IAEA personnel needed access to Zaporizhzhia to \"create conditions for stabilisation\".\n\n\"Any attack (on) a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,\" he told a news conference in Japan, where he attended the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony on Saturday to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing.\n\nThe world's worst civil nuclear disaster occurred in 1986 when a reactor at the Chornobyl complex in northwest Ukraine exploded. Soon after this year's Feb. 24 invasion Russian troops occupied that site, withdrawing from the area in late March.\n\nUkraine has said it is planning to conduct a major counter-offensive in the Russian-occupied south, apparently focused on the city of Kherson, west of Zaporizhzhia, and that it has already retaken dozens of villages.\n\nGRAIN EXPORTS PICK UP STEAM\n\nNearby, a deal to unblock Ukraine's food exports and ease global shortages gathered pace as two grain ships sailed out of Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Monday, raising the total to 12 since the first vessel left a week ago.\n\nThe two latest outgoing ships were carrying almost 59,000 tonnes of corn and soybeans and were bound for Italy and southeastern Turkey.

Russia claimed that Ukrainian shelling caused a power surge and fire and forced staff to lower output from two reactors, while Ukraine has blamed Russian troops for storing weapons there.\n\nNuclear experts have warned that more shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which was captured by Russia early in the war, is fraught with danger. The Kremlin echoed that statement Monday, claiming that Ukrainian shelling could create \"catastrophic\" consequences for Europe.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence spokesman, Andriy Yusov, countered that Russian forces have planted explosives at the plant to head off an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive in the region. Previously, Ukrainian officials have said Russia is launching attacks from the plant and using Ukrainian workers as human shields.\n\n\"As such I do not believe there would be a high probably of a breach of the containment building even if it was accidently struck by an explosive shell, and even less likely the reactor itself could be damaged by such,\" said Mark Wenman at the college's Nuclear Energy Futures.\n\nHe also said the spent fuel tanks, where the shells reportedly hit, are strong and probably don't contain much spent fuel.\n\n\"Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would be illegal according to international law, the likelihood of a serious nuclear release is still small,\" he said.\n\nBefore Sunday's shelling, the nuclear plant also came under fire last week. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Monday that the Ukrainian attack Sunday caused a power surge, and smoke at its switch facility, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished the flames, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged Western powers to force Kyiv to stop attacking the plant.\n\n\"Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous,\" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. \"It's fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for the entire Europe.\"\n\nBut Yusov, Ukraine's military intelligence spokesman, said the shelling came from Russian forces.\n\n\"If it's not so,\" he added, \"if it doesn't conform to reality, the Russians can make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA, if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nYusov said Russia used similar tactics at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant when they occupied it early in the war. \"This is a strategy of terror and scorched earth used by the Russians ahead of an inevitable Ukrainian counteroffensives in the south,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the ships that left Ukraine under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis arrived in Turkey, becoming the first vessel to reach its destination. The Turkey-flagged Polarnet, laden with 12,000 tons of corn, docked at the port of Derince after setting off from Chornomorsk on Friday.\n\n\"This sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Ukraine won't abandon you,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. \"If Russia sticks to its obligations, the 'grain corridor' will keep maintaining global food security.\"\n\nPolarnet Captain Ahmet Yucel Alibeyler highlighted the risks faced by grain-carrying ships trying to cross the Black Sea.\n\n\"These were, of course, dangerous areas, corridors that had been cleared, demined,\" he said.\n\nOn the front lines of the war, the Kremlin reasserted Monday that Russia will keep up its military attacks on Ukraine until it achieves its goals.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said the Russians had shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the previous 24 hours, killing five people.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south, local officials said, again hitting a strategic bridge in the southern city of Kherson.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol, a Russian-controlled city in the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region, said Ukraine used U.S. HIMARS rocket launchers to shell several facilities where the Russian military was stationed.\n\nKirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region, said Ukrainian shelling again damaged the Antonivskiy bridge over the Dnieper River. An artery for Russian military supplies, the bridge has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling, and plans to reopen it on Wednesday were now shelved, Stremousov said.\n\nRussian forces also kept shelling Nikopol, just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Ukraine's presidential office said. Nikopol's gas pipelines, plumbing and power lines are no longer functioning, leaving thousands of people without electricity.\n\nA total of 12 ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- 10 outbound and two inbound.

The Zaporizhzhia power plant, the largest in Europe, has been the scene of daily clashes since Friday, August 5. In his daily address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky went so far as to raise fears of an event comparable to the Chernobyl disaster (1986), only worse, saying that \"Chernobyl is the explosion of a reactor, and the Zaporizhzhia plant has six reactors.\" Moscow and Kyiv are blaming each other for the attacks, which on Tuesday, August 9 had not caused any radioactive leaks. Images broadcast by Russian media show the impact of projectiles on land around the nuclear power plant and the rear section of a large-caliber rocket (notoriously inaccurate) embedded in the ground.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry says that Ukrainian artillery fired on the nuclear power plant Saturday, August 6 at 12:40 pm from the right bank of the Dnieper river. On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denounced actions \"which have catastrophic consequences for vast areas of land, for all of Europe.\" Further heightening the climate of concern over nuclear issues, Moscow has informed Washington of the \"temporary\" cessation of visits to all Russian military sites subject to US inspections under the New Start nuclear disarmament treaty.\n\nOn the Ukrainian side, state nuclear operator Energoatom claims on the contrary that the Russian artillery targeted a high-voltage line connecting the plant to the Ukrainian electricity grid. President Zelensky put the ball back in the Russian court. \"There is no nation in the world that can feel safe when a terrorist state [Russia] bombs a nuclear power plant,\" he said in his daily video on Sunday, 7 August.\n\nHis US ally is also pointing the finger at Moscow. \"We continue to call on Russia to cease all military operations in and around Ukrainian nuclear power plants and to return control to Ukraine,\" the White House urged on Monday, August 8. \"Any attack on nuclear power plants is suicidal,\" warned UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nThe Ukrainian general staff regularly reports the shelling of areas on the banks of the Dnieper river (Nikopol and Marganiets) by Russian artillery based at the nuclear power plant. On Tuesday, August 9, the Russian-language investigative website The Insider (close to the Russian opposition) published images of a large deployment of Russian equipment within the grounds of the plant complex.

Its six pressurised water reactors (of which at least two are currently operating) are important to Kyiv as they can produce power for up to 4m homes.\n\nSituated on the south bank of the Dnieper river at Enerhodar, southwest of the city of Zaporizhzhia itself, the plant occupies an extremely important strategic position both for Russian and Ukrainian forces, who have been contesting control of the site since early in the war.\n\nThe presence of the water-cooled reactors, as well as a spent fuel storage facility, on the large and sprawling site has led Russia to use it as a so called \"sheltered\" artillery park, using the facilities to fire on Ukrainian positions in the belief that Ukraine would not fire back and risk a nuclear accident.\n\nThe US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has accused the Russians of using the plant as a \"nuclear shield\" saying: \"Of course the Ukrainians cannot fire back lest there be a terrible accident involving the nuclear plant.\"\n\nThat has allowed Russia to target areas like the city of Nikopol across the river which has come under heavy shelling in recent weeks.\n\nWhy is there renewed concern?\n\nThere are two issues fuelling a deepening anxiety over the situation at the plant, which is under Russian control but uses Ukrainian staff.\n\nInternational nuclear safety officials have become concerned over the lack of spare parts, access for routine maintenance of the reactors and lack of contact with staff all of which have been disrupted by the ongoing conflict.\n\nA second issue is grad missile fire around the plant at the weekend, with Russians and Ukrainians pointing the finger over responsibility.\n\nAccording to Energoatom - the Ukrainian nuclear authority - the impacts were close to the spent fuel storage area with the operator claiming Russian troops \"aimed specifically\" at the containers despite the presence of Russian troops at the site.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that Ukrainian officials at times have somewhat overstated claims about nuclear risks posed by the conflict both at Chornobyl and Zaporizhzhia - so for now it is not clear how dangerous this weekend's incident was in and of itself.\n\nWhile Ukraine's objective - to see the plant treated as a demilitarised area - is an entirely prudent call it would also serve a military objective by denying Russian forces the use of a plant from which they can shell with relative impunity.\n\nA final dimension is a claim by Ukrainian intelligence - reported in Ukrainian media outlets - that Russia has mined facilities, quoting the head of the radiation, chemical and biological defence troops of the Russian armed forces, Maj Gen Valery Vasiliev, who now commands the Zaporizhzhia garrison, saying: \"There will be either Russian land or a scorched desert.\"\n\nHowever, a major and deliberate detonation in Zaporizhzhia would threaten southern Russia as well as Ukraine with nuclear contamination, so it is important to distinguish between \"nuclear blackmail\" and a serious threat that would have repercussions for Russia itself.\n\nSo how dangerous is shelling around the plant?\n\nThe reactors are designed to withstand substantial impact - think of a civilian airliner crashing into them - protected with steel and reinforced concrete as well as fire protection systems, although a strike from a substantial missile might be more problematic.\n\nThe buildings housing the spent fuel, however, are not built with a similar level of protection, meaning that a release of spent fuel material is probably a greater risk from fighting than a catastrophic breach of a reactor, although more limited.\n\nThe reality is that the situation at the plant in terms of safety operations is probably the most serious issue, as a deteriorating safety regime caused by the conflict has been exacerbated by a risk of a strike.\n\nThe head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, described the ongoing crisis of safety oversight as a dire threat to public health and the environment in Ukraine, and far beyond its borders, describing the situation as \"completely out of control\".\n\n\"You have a catalogue of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility,\" he said.\n\n\"While Grossi has suggested a mission to the plant, ironically Ukraine has been blocking the initiative, with Energoatom arguing as recently as June that any visit would legitimise Russia's presence there.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/6283/3141722_1_articlelarge_UKRAINE_20Russia_20190548.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 17, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 24, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144194875", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "16:29:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T16:29:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T16:29:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6901960968971252, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/08/08/unstoppable-radioactive-wind-could-spread-europe-russia-bombards/", "title": "Unstoppable 'radioactive wind' could spread over Europe as Russia bombards nuclear plant", "body": "UN urged to deploy peacekeepers on the ground to keep Zaporizhzhia power station safe, amid fears of a Chernobyl-style disaster\n\nAn unstoppable wind of \"radioactive contamination\" could spread over Europe if the West does not act to stop Russia's assault on the continent's largest nuclear power plant, Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has warned.\n\nLast weekend's artillery barrages at Zaporizhzhia, in Russian-occupied territory in southern Ukraine, have sparked international fears of a Chernobyl-style disaster.\n\nFighting around the facility, located on the banks of the Dniper River, has intensified as Ukrainian forces battle to reclaim territories occupied by Russia in the south.\n\nBoth Moscow and Kyiv traded blame for the shelling around the power plant, which was captured by Russian fighters in early March.\n\nUkraine's state-run nuclear power company warned the bombardment had damaged radiation sensors, after strikes close to a storage facility for spent fuel at the plant.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said on Monday that Ukrainian attacks had damaged high-voltage power lines into the Soviet-era plant and forced it to reduce output by two of its six reactors to \"prevent disruption\".\n\n'Radioactive contamination'\n\nThe clashes prompted calls for the United Nation's atomic watchdog and international peacekeepers to be deployed on the ground to ensure the plant remains safe.\n\nIn his overnight address late on Sunday, Mr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, said: \"There is no such nation in the world that can feel safe when a terrorist state fires at a nuclear plant.\n\n\"God forbid, if something irreparable happens, no one will stop the wind that will spread the radioactive contamination.\"\n\nThe wartime leader proposed the introduction of sanctions on Russian nuclear energy and uranium exports as part of a possible Western response to \"the threat that Russia created by striking at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant\".\n\nThe invaders have forced the plant's Ukrainian technicians to remain working, in often violent conditions, at the facility in order to keep it running.

Russia claimed that Ukrainian shelling caused a power surge and fire and forced staff to lower output from two reactors, while Ukraine has blamed Russian troops for storing weapons there.\n\nNuclear experts have warned that more shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which was captured by Russia early in the war, is fraught with danger. The Kremlin echoed that statement Monday, claiming that Ukrainian shelling could create \"catastrophic\" consequences for Europe.\n\nRafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has warned that the way the plant was being run under Russian forces and the fighting going on around it are posing grave health and environmental threats.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence chief, Andriy Yusov, countered the Russian statements by saying his organization had received credible information from several sources that Russian forces have planted explosives at the Zaporizhzhia plant to head off an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive in the region. Previously, Ukrainian officials have said Russia is launching attacks from the plant and using its Ukrainian workers as human shields.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Igor Konashenkov said Monday that the Ukrainian attack a day earlier at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant caused a power surge and smoke erupted at its switch facility, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished the fire, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged Western powers to force Kyiv to stop attacking the plant.\n\n\"Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous,\" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. \"It's fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for the entire Europe.\"\n\nBut Yusov, Ukraine's military intelligence chief, said Monday: \"We have seen the Russian shelling of the Ukrainian nuclear power plant.\"\n\nHe added that, \"If it's not so, if it doesn't conform to reality, the Russians can make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA, if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nYusov said the Russians used similar tactics at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant when they had occupied it early in the war.\n\n\"This is a strategy of terror and scorched earth used by the Russians ahead of an inevitable Ukrainian counteroffensives in the south,\" he said.\n\nOn the high seas, meanwhile, the first of the ships to leave Ukraine under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis has arrived in Turkey. The Turkey-flagged Polarnet docked at the port of Derince in the Gulf of Izmit after setting off from the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk on Friday laden with 12,000 tons of corn.\n\n\"This sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Ukraine won't abandon you,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. \"If Russia sticks to its obligations, the 'grain corridor' will keep maintaining global food security.\"\n\nYet Polarnet Captain Ahmet Yucel Alibeyler highlighted the risks faced by grain-carrying ships trying to cross the Black Sea.\n\n\"These were, of course, dangerous areas, corridors that had been cleared, demined,\" he said.\n\nOn the front lines of the war, the Kremlin reasserted Monday that Russia will keep up its military attacks on Ukraine until it achieves its goals.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said Monday that the Russian military shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the past 24 hours, killing five people and wounding 20 more.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south of the country overnight, local officials said, again hitting a strategic bridge in the southern city of Kherson.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol, a Russian-controlled city in the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region, said Ukrainian forces used U.S. HIMARS rocket launchers to shell several facilities where the Russian military was stationed. Mayor Ivan Fyodorov said on Telegram that some 100 Russian troops were killed. His claims could not be independently verified, and the Russian military did not immediately comment.\n\nKirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region, said Monday morning that Ukrainian shelling again damaged the Antonivskiy bridge over the Dnieper River.\n\nThe bridge, a key artery for Russian military supplies, has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling and plans to reopen it on Wednesday were shelved due to the latest attack, Stremousov said.\n\nRussian forces also kept shelling Nikopol, a city just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine's presidential office said. Nikopol's gas pipelines, plumbing and power lines are no longer functioning, and thousands of people are left without electricity.\n\nA total of 12 ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- ten outbound and two headed for Ukraine. Some 322,000 metric tons of agricultural products have left Ukrainian ports, the bulk of it corn but also sunflower oil and soya.\n\nFour ships that left Ukraine on Sunday are expected to anchor near Istanbul on Monday evening and be inspected on Tuesday to make sure they are carrying only food items south and no weapons into Ukraine.\n\nBut the grain deal remains far from plain sailing. The first cargo ship to leave Ukraine, the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, left Odessa on Aug. 1 heading for Lebanon with 26,000 metric tons of corn for chicken feed. But it has run into a business dispute and will no longer dock in Lebanon, the Tripoli port chief told The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nUkraine's embassy in Beirut tweeted Monday that the corn's final buyer in Lebanon refused to accept the cargo due to the delivery delay beyond a contractual limit and that the shipper was now looking for another buyer for the corn.\n\nKareem Chehayeb in Beirut, Mehmet Guzel in Derince, Turkey, and Andrew Wilks in Istanbul contributed.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

On Friday, Russians shelled the power plant twice, damaging critical infrastructure and radiation sensors.\n\nThe attacks continued throughout the weekend. The nuclear power company Energoatom said in a Telegram post on Friday the attacks came within hours of each other, with the second attack using rocket-propelled grenades that struck Zaporizhzhia \"near one of the power units where the nuclear reactor is located,\" the company said.\n\n\"There are risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances. Fire danger is high.\" On Sunday, as more explosions could be heard, the company posted again, warning: \"This time a nuclear catastrophe was miraculously avoided, but miracles cannot last forever.\"\n\nThe plant is in control of the Russians though it is handled by Ukrainians, with both sides blaming each other for the attacks. Overnight, following talks with European Council President Charles Michel, president Zelensky warned: \"God forbid something irreparable will happen -- and no one will stop the wind that will spread the radioactive contamination. Russian nuclear terror requires a stronger response from the international community -- sanctions on the Russian nuclear industry and nuclear fuel.\"\n\nZelensky's condemnation was echoed by international observers. \"Any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,\" UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said Monday. Speaking at a news conference in Japan two days after attending a memorial ceremony in Hiroshima for the 77th anniversary of the world's first nuclear bombing, Guterres also called for the International Atomic Energy Agency to be given access to the imperilled plant. \"We fully support the IAEA in all their efforts in relation to create the conditions of stabilization of the plant,\" he said.\n\nRussian authorities confirmed damage at the plant, but said it had been caused by an artillery strike launched by \"Ukrainian nationalists.\" \"Two high-voltage power lines and a water pipeline were damaged as a result of the shelling,\" the Russian embassy in Washington, D.C., said in a statement. \"Only thanks to the effective and timely actions of the Russian military in covering the nuclear power facility, its critical infrastructure was not affected.\"\n\nDoubling down on denials of Kremlin culpability, the Russian-appointed Zaporizhia Oblast Occupation Administration chief Evgeniy Balitskyi thundered on Telegram: \"The Nazi leadership of Kyiv has completely lost touch with reality,\" adding that \"Ukrainian terrorists decided to put the whole of Europe on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe.\"\n\nOn Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the shelling of the plant by \"Ukrainian armed forces\" was \"fraught with catastrophic consequences\" for Europe. But Ukrainian media reports suggested that Russian troops were themselves threatening to blow up the plant rather than let it fall out of their control. Valery Vasilyev, a major general with Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops, reportedly announced that his soldiers occupying the site had \"mined all important objects\" at the plant, and said that Russian fighters must be ready to \"fulfil an important order.\" \"The enemy knows that the station will be either Russian or no one's,\" Vasilyev allegedly said in a report released on Russian-controlled media outlets which was subsequently taken down. \"You must understand that we have no other way. If there is the toughest order, we must fulfil it with honor.\"\n\nNews of the dangerous strikes comes after Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week accused Russia of using the plant as a \"nuclear shield\" by turning it into a military base. By stationing its troops there, the Kremlin was acting with the \"height of irresponsibility,\" Blinken said, as exchanges of fire could lead to disaster.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3166,w_5628,x_0,y_449/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1659939408/2022-08-06T193923Z_2060525197_RC2LPV92OKJL_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-IAEA_qrwbr6", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.6549019607843137, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 18, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 28, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7145128568", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-09", "time": "11:31:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-09T11:31:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-09T11:30:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "url": "https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-crisis/ukraine-warns-blowing-of-zaporizhzhia-npp-will-become-disaster-for-russias-crimea-too-articleshow.html", "title": "Ukraine warns blowing of Zaporizhzhia NPP will become 'disaster' for Russia's Crimea too", "body": "The head of the Ukrainian Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, Oleksandr Starukh, warned of Russia's intention to blow the Zaporizhzhia NPP.\n\nThe head of the Ukrainian Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, Oleksandr Starukh, warned of Russia's intention to blow the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) and anticipated that \"if Moscow tries to blow the site, it would become a disaster for not only Ukraine but also for Russia's Crimea\". According to the administration, the site contains 1,200 tonnes of nuclear fuel. \"If Russia decides to commit a terrorist attack, the nuclear disaster will affect the territories of both Russia and Ukraine,\" the administration said in a Telegram post on Monday. \"One nuclear bomb contains 9 kilograms of uranium or plutonium, and our station has 1,200 tons,\" it added.\n\nFurther, the Ukrainian military claimed that the situation tailored by the Russians was inevitable and added it was impossible to conduct military operations with the use of heavy equipment on the territory of the nuclear power plant. It simply violates the logic of human existence, noted the Zaporizhzhia administration. The latest remarks came as both-- Russia and Ukraine-- traded accusations that each side is shelling Europe's biggest nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. On one hand, Moscow claimed that Ukrainian shelling caused a power surge and fire and forced staff to lower output from two reactors, on the other hand, Kyiv has blamed Russian troops for storing weapons there.\n\nWhile addressing a press conference on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Kyiv was attacking the plant and urged Western powers to force a stop to that. \"Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous. It's fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for entire Europe,\" said Peskov. However, Ukraine's military intelligence spokesman, Andriy Yusov, countered the statement and claimed Russian forces have planted explosives at the plant to head off an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive in the region. Also, the spokesman appealed to Russia to make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency). He added if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not want to hand over the control to IAEA, the Ukrainian military is ready to take charge.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/ozdr37xbhzmhl4bv_1660039774.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 11, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 15, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7143739921", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "09:43:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T09:43:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T09:43:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "url": "https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/ukraine-conflict/1659947859-un-chief-asks-for-access-to-ukraine-s-nuclear-plant-after-new-attack", "title": "UN chief asks for access to Ukraine's nuclear plant after new attack - I24NEWS", "body": "Antonio Guterres told journalists that 'any attack (on) a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing'\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday called for international inspectors to be granted entry to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant following recent shelling that Kyiv and Moscow traded blame for.\n\nGuterres said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) needed access to the plant.\n\n\"We fully support the IAEA in all their efforts in relation to creat(ing) the conditions for stabilization of the plant,\" he underlined.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, while attending the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony in Japan, Guterres told journalists that \"any attack (on) a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing.\"\n\nHis comments came shortly after the Zaporizhzhia nuclear reactor complex in southeastern Ukraine was damaged by renewed shelling over the weekend.

The operational plant is located on the front lines of the ongoing battle between Ukraine and Russia. The people operating the plant are Ukrainians but the area around it has been seized by Russian forces and there are reports the Russians have been setting up their artillery near the plant as a way to shield it from any return fire.\n\nThe Russians have been firing from the cover of the Zaporizhzhia station since mid-July, Ukrainian military and civilian officials said, sending rockets over the river at Nikopol and other targets.\n\nIt is, in effect, a free shot. Ukraine cannot unleash volleys of shells in return using American-provided advanced rocket systems, which have silenced Russian guns elsewhere on the front line. Doing so would risk striking one of the six pressurized water reactors or highly radioactive waste in storage. And Russia knows it.\n\nThe chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned last week that the situation was \"completely out of control.\" He demanded that his teams be allowed to access the site to ensure the operation was still being operated safely. But over the weekend the situation got worse when there was shelling near the plant. Both Russia and Ukraine are blaming one another for the strikes.\n\nOn Friday, explosions rang out at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power complex, the biggest of its kind in Europe, reigniting fears of a potential disaster.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the plant, which was taken over by Russian forces in early March, along with the town of Enerhodar, where the complex is located.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky blamed Moscow for the attack, calling the strikes a \"brazen crime\" and an \"act of terror.\"\n\n\"Today, the occupiers created another extremely risky situation for everyone in Europe,\" he said in his nightly address on Friday.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry denied the claim, saying the Ukrainians had carried out three artillery strikes on the plant and surrounding area.\n\nA strike which hit one of the operating reactors could potentially lead to radiation being spread into the atmosphere or even to a meltdown of one of the reactors. Today the IAEA called the shelling \"suicidal.\"\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for international inspectors to be given access to the sprawling nuclear site as fears grew of a disaster after the weekend strikes left the plant damaged but still operational.\n\n\"Any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,\" he said Monday in Tokyo after attending a ceremony in Hiroshima to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing.\n\nHowever, Ukraine's desire to see the plant demilitarized isn't purely about safety. Russia has been firing missiles at Ukrainian positions from the site, making it more difficult for Ukrainian soldiers to advance on Russia positions. So they have a strategic interest in making this into a crisis that could result in additional pressure to force Russia away from the plant. Keep that in mind because this next claim is coming from the Ukrainian energy company that is operating the nuclear plant. Energoatom claims Russia is prepared to blow up the plant rather than leave the area:\n\nEnergoatom claims that the head of the radiation, chemical and biological protection troops of the Russian armed forces, Major General Valerii Vasyliev, who now commands the garrison at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, told his soldiers that \"there will be either Russian land or a scorched desert here\".\n\nThe press release quotes Vasyliev as telling his troops, \"As you know, we have mined all the important facilities of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant. And we're not hiding it from the enemy. We warned them. The enemy knows that the station will be either Russian or no-one's.\"\n\nIs this true? Is it a bluff by the Russians to maintain control of a site from which they can attack without repercussions? Or is Energoatom making this claim to apply pressure to Russia and potentially force them out of the area?

Targeting the facility with any \"military firepower\" amounts to \"playing with fire, with potentially catastrophic consequences,\" the UN nuclear watchdog's director general, Rafael Grossi, said.\n\nThe IAEA also suggested sending a delegation to the site to \"provide technical support for nuclear safety and security\" and to \"help prevent the situation from spiraling even more out of control.\" Neither Moscow nor Kiev has reacted to the proposal so far.\n\nThe Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant in the country's south was seized by Russian forces in late February, when Moscow launched its military campaign in Ukraine.

A senior non-proliferation and arms control official at the Russian Foreign Ministry warned that the attacks on the plant risk triggering an event similar to the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said \"parts of the equipment\" at the plant were out of power due to the shelling, and a fire broke out at the facility and was quickly put out. The ministry claimed that \"by sheer luck,\" the Ukrainian shells did not cause a bigger fire and \"a possible nuclear disaster.\"\n\nUkrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, however, claimed that the shelling of the nuclear plant came from Russian troops themselves.

catastrophe, describing attacks on the country's atomic plants as \"a suicidal thing\".\n\nHis plea came after shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, near the southern front line of the fighting, which Ukraine and Russia blamed on each other.\n\nSpeaking in Japan after visiting the site of the nuclear bombing in Hiroshima 77 years ago, Mr Guterres called on the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency to enter Zaporizhzhia to ensure the site was safe.\n\n\"Any attack on a nuclear plant is suicidal thing and I hope that those attacks will end,\" he said.\n\nAmid concerns that Russia will turn to its doomsday weapons if cornered in Ukraine, Mr Guterres urged all nuclear-armed powers to commit to the principle of never ordering a first strike or threatening countries with no nuclear deterrent.\n\n\"I believe this is the moment when the risk of a nuclear confrontation is back -- something that we had forgotten for decades,\" he said.\n\n\"I hope these asks will be taken seriously because we are witnessing a radicalisation in the geopolitical situation that makes the risk of a nuclear war again something we cannot completely forget.\"\n\nConcerns are growing over Zaporizhzhia, the biggest of Ukraine's four nuclear plants, as the two sides battle for control of southern Ukraine in what British intelligence described as a new phase of the war.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address on Sunday that \"no one will stop the wind\" from spreading radioactive waste beyond Ukraine's borders if there is a safety breach at nuclear plant.\n\nHe called for a \"principled response\" from the international community to what he described as two Russian attacks on Zaporizhzhia in one day. Russia claimed Ukraine had attacked its own power plant.\n\nRussia occupied the plant in the early stages of the invasion and Rafael Grossi, the head of the IAEA, last week said nearly every principle of nuclear safety had been compromised in recent months.\n\nHe said he was ready to lead a mission to Zaporizhzhia to stabilise the situation and inspect the safety of the plant but that this had not yet been possible.\n\nMr Guterres said he and his colleagues \"fully support the IAEA in all their efforts in relation to creating the conditions of stabilisation of that plant\".\n\nA separate IAEA mission went in April to the site of the Chernobyl disaster, where alarms had been raised when Russian troops occupied the territory on the first day of their invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSome safety data from Chernobyl, where a reactor exploded in 1986 in the world's worst nuclear catastrophe, is not reaching UN inspectors during the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nAs Russia prepares for a counter-attack in the south, its military is suspected by British intelligence of using anti-personnel mines to defend its positions in the eastern Donbas.\n\nRussia is likely to be using PFM1 mines, also known as \"butterfly mines\", according to Britain's Ministry of Defence, which said they were used to devastating effect during the Soviet war in Afghanistan in the 1980s.\n\nMoscow is still using the same Soviet stocks and they are likely to have degraded since then and become \"highly unreliable and unpredictable\", the MoD said.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_stickings@thenationalnews.com", "name": "Tim Stickings", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/MJE8M851GQBuisQw66xAL_4BQfU=/1440x810/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/thenational/K5V2UBVOK47NPLVFGIKIAGBKKU.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.4666666666666667, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 8, "stanza_neu": 12, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 20, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7143898902", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "12:03:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T12:03:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T12:03:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "url": "https://www.highlandstoday.com/ukraine-calls-for-demilitarized-zone-around-shelled-nuclear-power-plant/", "title": "Ukraine calls for demilitarized zone around shelled nuclear power plant", "body": "KYIV, Aug 8 (Reuters) -

Russia claimed that Ukrainian shelling caused a power surge and fire and forced staff to lower output from two reactors, while Ukraine has blamed Russian troops for storing weapons there.\n\nNuclear experts have warned that more shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which was captured by Russia early in the war, is fraught with danger.\n\nThe Kremlin echoed that Monday, claiming that Kyiv was attacking the plant and urging Western powers to force a stop to that.\n\n\"Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. \"It's fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for the entire Europe.\"\n\nCardinals trade Harrison Bader to New York Yankees for Jordan Montgomery How Yadier Molina's 'sick' sense for pitches and Cardinals daring defense bested Yankees 'You're good.

Previously, Ukrainian officials have said Russia is launching attacks from the plant and using Ukrainian workers there as human shields.\n\nYusov called on Russia to \"make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nUkraine's ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, likewise urged that the United Nations, the IAEA and the international community send a delegation to \"completely demilitarize the territory\" and provide security guarantees to plant employees and the city where the plant is based, Enerhodar.\n\nThe IAEA is the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog. Its director-general, Rafael Grossi, told The Associated Press last week that the situation surrounding the Zaporizhzhia plant \"is completely out of control,\" and issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to allow experts to visit the complex to stabilize the situation and avoid a nuclear accident.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced support for that idea Monday, saying, \"any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing.\"\n\nOne expert in nuclear materials at Imperial College London said the reactor at Zaporizhzhia is modern and housed inside a heavily reinforced steel-and-concrete building designed to protect against disasters.\n\n\"As such, I do not believe there would be a high probably of a breach of the containment building, even if it was accidently struck by an explosive shell, and even less likely the reactor itself could be damaged,\" said Mark Wenman at the college's Nuclear Energy Futures.\n\nHe also said the complex's spent fuel tanks, where the shells reportedly hit, are strong and probably don't contain much spent fuel.\n\n\"Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would be illegal according to international law, the likelihood of a serious nuclear release is still small,\" he said.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the attack Sunday caused a power surge and smoke, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished flames, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nAnd the head of the Ukrainian company operating the plant said all but one power line connecting it to Ukraine's energy system had been destroyed. Petro Kotin, head of the Ukrainian state corporation Eherhoatom, blamed Russian shelling and said a blackout would be \"very unsafe for such a nuclear facility.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy decried \"the shelling and mining\" of the plant and called it \"nuclear blackmail.\" He called for sanctions against Moscow's nuclear industry.\n\nAs fighting continued on the front lines, the United States on Monday pledged another $1 billion in new military aid for Ukraine. It would be the biggest delivery yet of rockets, ammunition and other arms straight from U.S. Department of Defense stocks for Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe latest announcement brings total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine by the Biden administration to $9.1 billion since Russian troops invaded on Feb. 24.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said the Russians had shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the previous 24 hours, killing five people. Among the targets, it said, was Nikopol, just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia plant. Thousands of people were without electricity there.\n\nRussian rockets and artillery also hit across the Sumy region, killing one person, and the Ukrainian governor of the eastern Donetsk region said the cities of Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Lyman had emerged as fighting hotspots.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south, officials there said, including the strategic Antonivskiy bridge in the southern city of Kherson. An artery for Russian military supplies, the bridge has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling. Plans to reopen it on Wednesday were now shelved, said Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the ships that left Ukraine on Friday under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis arrived in Turkey, the first loaded vessel to reach its destination. The Turkey-flagged Polarnet was laden with 12,000 tons of corn.\n\n\"This sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Ukraine won't abandon you,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. \"If Russia sticks to its obligations, the 'grain corridor' will keep maintaining global food security.\"\n\nTwelve ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- 10 outbound and two inbound. Some 322,000 metric tons of agricultural products have left Ukrainian ports, the bulk of it corn but also sunflower oil and soya.\n\nFour ships that left Ukraine on Sunday were expected to anchor near Istanbul on Monday evening for inspection to make sure they are carrying only food.\n\nThe first cargo ship to leave Ukraine, the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, which left Odesa on Aug. 1, hit a snag with delivery, however. It was heading for Lebanon with 26,000 metric tons of corn for chicken feed but the corn's buyer in Lebanon refused to accept the cargo, since it was delivered much later than its contract, Ukraine's embassy in Beirut said.\n\nKareem Chehayeb in Beirut, Mehmet Guzel in Derince, Turkey, and Andrew Wilks in Istanbul contributed.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

On Friday, Russians shelled the power plant twice, damaging critical infrastructure and radiation sensors.\n\nPutin's Pals Furious Younger Russians Don't Want to Die in Ukraine\n\nThe attacks continued throughout the weekend. The nuclear power company Energoatom said in a Telegram post on Friday the attacks came within hours of each other, with the second attack using rocket-propelled grenades that struck Zaporizhzhia \"near one of the power units where the nuclear reactor is located,\" the company said.\n\n\"There are risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances. Fire danger is high.\" On Sunday, as more explosions could be heard, the company posted again, warning: \"This time a nuclear catastrophe was miraculously avoided, but miracles cannot last forever.\"\n\nThe plant is in control of the Russians though it is handled by Ukrainians, with both sides blaming each other for the attacks. Overnight, following talks with European Council President Charles Michel, president Zelensky warned: \"God forbid something irreparable will happen -- and no one will stop the wind that will spread the radioactive contamination. Russian nuclear terror requires a stronger response from the international community -- sanctions on the Russian nuclear industry and nuclear fuel.\"\n\nZelensky's condemnation was echoed by international observers. \"Any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,\" UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said Monday. Speaking at a news conference in Japan two days after attending a memorial ceremony in Hiroshima for the 77th anniversary of the world's first nuclear bombing, Guterres also called for the International Atomic Energy Agency to be given access to the imperilled plant. \"We fully support the IAEA in all their efforts in relation to create the conditions of stabilization of the plant,\" he said.\n\nRussian authorities confirmed damage at the plant, but said it had been caused by an artillery strike launched by \"Ukrainian nationalists.\" \"Two high-voltage power lines and a water pipeline were damaged as a result of the shelling,\" the Russian embassy in Washington, D.C., said in a statement. \"Only thanks to the effective and timely actions of the Russian military in covering the nuclear power facility, its critical infrastructure was not affected.\"\n\nDoubling down on denials of Kremlin culpability, the Russian-appointed Zaporizhia Oblast Occupation Administration chief Evgeniy Balitskyi thundered on Telegram: \"The Nazi leadership of Kyiv has completely lost touch with reality,\" adding that \"Ukrainian terrorists decided to put the whole of Europe on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe.\"\n\nNews of the dangerous strikes comes after Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week accused Russia of using the plant as a \"nuclear shield\" by turning it into a military base. By stationing its troops there, the Kremlin was acting with the \"height of irresponsibility,\" Blinken said, as exchanges of fire could lead to disaster.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

The area, including the city of Kherson, is now the target of a Ukrainian counter-offensive. Ukraine appealed for the area around the complex to be demilitarised and for the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, to be let in. Russia said it too favoured an IAEA visit, which it accused Ukraine of blocking while trying to \"take Europe hostage\" by shelling the plant.\n\nUkraine blamed Russia for weekend attacks around the complex, which is still being run by Ukrainian technicians. It said three radiation sensors were damaged and two workers injured by shrapnel. As of Monday morning, the plant appeared to still be running, said Petro Kotin, head of Ukraine's state nuclear power company Energoatom. He said 500 Russian soldiers and 50 pieces of heavy machinery, including tanks, trucks and armoured infantry vehicles were at the site.\n\nThe Ukrainian staff at the plant had nowhere to shelter, he added. Reuters could not independently verify either side's account.\n\nKotin called for peacekeepers to run the Zaporizhzhia site, flagging the risk of shells hitting its six containers of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel. In an evening video shared online, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new Western sanctions on Russia's nuclear industry \"for creating the threat of a nuclear disaster.\" Dr Mark Wenman, a nuclear expert at Imperial College London, played down the risk of a major incident, saying the Zaporizhzhia reactors were relatively robust and the spent fuel well protected.\n\n\"Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would be illegal ...the likelihood of a serious nuclear release is still small,\" he said in a statement. WORKING UNDER 'RUSSIAN GUNS'\n\nThe world's worst civil nuclear disaster occurred in 1986 when a reactor at the Chornobyl complex in northwest Ukraine exploded. Soon after this year's Feb. 24 invasion, Russian troops occupied that site, withdrawing in late March. Ukraine has said it is planning to conduct a major counter-offensive around Kherson and that it has already retaken dozens of villages.\n\nIts forces are also fighting to retake areas near Kharkiv in the north, where Russian forces launched artillery strikes on Monday, Ukraine's general staff said. In Ukraine's Donetsk region, where pro-Moscow separatists seized territory after the Kremlin annexed Crimea to the south in 2014, Russia was \"using all available fire power...to try and inflict maximum losses on Ukrainian units to prevent them from reinforcing other areas,\" the general staff added.\n\nStepping up its fiscal aid and military spending on Ukraine, Washington announced it will send $4.5 billion in budgetary support and $1 billion in weapons, including long-range rocket munitions and armored medical transport vehicles. Overall, the United States has contributed more than $18 billion to Ukraine this year. Russia's foreign ministry meanwhile told the United States it was suspending inspection activities under their START nuclear arms control treaty, though it said Moscow remained committed to the treaty's provisions.\n\nGRAIN EXPORTS PICK UP Adding weight to a rare diplomatic success since the war began, a deal to unblock Ukraine's food exports and ease global shortages gathered pace as two grain ships carrying almost 59,000 tonnes of corn and soybeans sailed out of Ukrainian Black Sea ports.\n\nThat raised the total to 12 since the first vessel left a week ago. The July 22 grain export pact, brokered by Turkey and the United Nations, was further underpinned as the parties issued procedures for merchant ships carrying Ukrainian grain, including a 10-nautical-mile military exclusion zone, according to a document seen by Reuters.\n\nBefore the invasion, Russia and Ukraine together accounted for nearly a third of global wheat exports. Russia says it is waging a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine to rid it of nationalists and protect Russian-speaking communities. Ukraine and the West describe Russia's actions as an unprovoked war of aggression.\n\nThe conflict has displaced millions, killed thousands of civilians and left cities, towns and villages in ruins.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_18_18_10_5703828.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 23, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 32, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144113063", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "15:13:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T15:13:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T14:23:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "url": "https://journalnow.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/nuclear-plant-in-ukraine-is-shelled-rising-dangers-feared/article_9ddb6355-128a-5047-afec-9cf568d26381.html", "title": "Nuclear plant in Ukraine is shelled; Rising dangers feared", "body": "By SUSIE BLANN - Associated Press\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia and Ukraine traded accusations Monday that each side is shelling Europe's biggest nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine.

Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Monday that the Ukrainian attack a day earlier at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant caused a power surge and smoke erupted at its switch facility, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished the fire, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged Western powers to force Kyiv to stop attacking the plant.\n\n\"Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous,\" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. \"It's fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for the entire Europe.\"\n\nBut Yusov, Ukraine's military intelligence chief, said Monday: \"We have seen the Russian shelling of the Ukrainian nuclear power plant.\"\n\nHe added that, \"If it's not so, if it doesn't conform to reality, the Russians can make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA, if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nYusov said the Russians used similar tactics at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant when they had occupied it early in the war.\n\n\"This is a strategy of terror and scorched earth used by the Russians ahead of an inevitable Ukrainian counteroffensives in the south,\" he said.\n\nOn the high seas, meanwhile, the first of the ships to leave Ukraine under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis has arrived in Turkey.

Mayor Ivan Fyodorov said on Telegram that some 100 Russian troops were killed. His claims could not be independently verified, and the Russian military did not immediately comment.\n\nKirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region, said Monday morning that Ukrainian shelling again damaged the Antonivskiy bridge over the Dnieper River.\n\nThe bridge, a key artery for Russian military supplies, has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling and plans to reopen it on Wednesday were shelved due to the latest attack, Stremousov said.\n\nRussian forces also kept shelling Nikopol, a city just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine's presidential office said. Nikopol's gas pipelines, plumbing and power lines are no longer functioning, and thousands of people are left without electricity.\n\nA total of 12 ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- ten outbound and two headed for Ukraine. Some 322,000 metric tons of agricultural products have left Ukrainian ports, the bulk of it corn but also sunflower oil and soya.\n\nFour ships that left Ukraine on Sunday are expected to anchor near Istanbul on Monday evening and be inspected on Tuesday to make sure they are carrying only food items south and no weapons into Ukraine.\n\nBut the grain deal remains far from plain sailing. The first cargo ship to leave Ukraine, the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, left Odessa on Aug. 1 heading for Lebanon with 26,000 metric tons of corn for chicken feed. But it has run into a business dispute and will no longer dock in Lebanon, the Tripoli port chief told The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nUkraine's embassy in Beirut tweeted Monday that the corn's final buyer in Lebanon refused to accept the cargo due to the delivery delay beyond a contractual limit and that the shipper was now looking for another buyer for the corn.\n\nKareem Chehayeb in Beirut, Mehmet Guzel in Derince, Turkey, and Andrew Wilks in Istanbul contributed.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

International anxiety about the Kremlin's potential to use weapons of mass destruction has festered for months, as the U.S. and European states have equipped Ukrainian forces to thwart the main objectives of the invading Russian forces while tempering the weapons transfers in a bid to avoid Russian retaliation.\n\n\"In Hiroshima, I made two concrete asks: First, ask [the] nuclear-armed countries to commit to no-first-use of nuclear weapons and ask nuclear-armed countries never to use or threaten non-nuclear-armed countries with the use of nuclear weapons, with full transparency in relation to their arsenals,\" Guterres said. \"I hope these asks will be taken seriously because we are witnessing a radicalization in the geopolitical situation that makes the risk of a nuclear war again something we cannot completely forget.\"\n\nPENTAGON PROJECTS RUSSIAN CASUALTY COUNT IN UKRAINE TO BE NEAR 70,000-80,000\n\nThe value of \"no-first-use\" policies is a subject of debate among American policymakers, as the formal pledge not to be the first country to use a nuclear weapon in a conflict could lead other countries to believe they can win a war if the U.S. doesn't have a strong enough conventional military presence in a given conflict zone.\n\nScenarios involving a Russian nuclear strike have derived plausibility from Russian President Vladimir Putin's intermittent references to Moscow's nuclear arsenal, as well as the NATO member-state assessments that the Kremlin has embraced a theory that so-called tactical nuclear weapons could be used in Europe without provoking a nuclear retaliation from the U.S. And as the war has unfolded, Ukraine's battlefield successes have raised the possibility that Kyiv can launch counterattacks to reclaim territory lost in the first weeks of the war.\n\n\"The Ukrainians are starting to put some pressure down south, and the Russians have been forced to redeploy their forces down there,\" Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told reporters at the Pentagon. \"So yes, both sides are taking casualties, the war is the most intense conventional conflict in Europe since the Second World War, but the Ukrainians have a lot of advantages, not the least of which their will to fight.\"\n\nGuterres, fresh off brokering a deal to allow for the resumption of grain shipments out of blockaded Ukrainian ports, cast doubt on the idea that this limited agreement might lead to an end of the fighting.\n\n\"The difficult thing in relation to a ceasefire comes from a simple fact: Ukraine cannot accept a situation in which its territory is taken by another country, and the Russian Federation doesn't seem ready to accept that the areas that Russian forces have taken will not be annexed by Russian Federation or give way to new independent states,\" Guterres said. \"So these two positions, at the present moment, are not possible to conciliate.\"\n\nA Kremlin proxy in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region -- home to one of the largest nuclear power plants in the world, a facility currently occupied by Russia -- announced Monday that he plans to hold \"a referendum on the Zaporizhzhia region's reunification with Russia.\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected these \"pseudo-referendums in the occupied areas,\" saying that the attempt to carve the territory away will preclude peace talks.\n\n\"The position of our state remains the same: We will not give up anything of ours, and if the occupiers follow the path of these pseudo-referendums, they will close for themselves any possibility of negotiations with Ukraine and the free world, which the Russian side will definitely need in a certain moment,\" he said Sunday.\n\nThe prospect of a radiological catastrophe arose on Saturday around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russian troops are \"using the plant as a military base to fire at Ukrainians,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken alleged last week, and the warring parties blamed each other for explosions near the plant.\n\n\"There is no such nation in the world that can feel safe when a terrorist state fires at a nuclear plant,\" Zelensky said Sunday. \"God forbid, if something irreparable happens, no one will stop the wind that will spread the radioactive contamination. Therefore, a principled response of the international community to these Russian attacks on the Zaporizhzhia NPP -- the largest in Europe -- is needed right now.\"\n\nRussia has accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the plant as a means of \"taking all of Europe hostage\" to their war aims.\n\n\"The Ukrainians are taking aim at themselves,\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Monday. \"We regularly send the IAEA updated information 'from the scene,' which is reflected in the information circulars of the agency, which clearly expose the criminal actions of the Ukrainian armed forces, the command of which has completely lost the ability to think straight.\"\n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Rafael Grossi invokes the Ukrainian government energy agency as its primary source of information on the facility.\n\n\"Any military firepower directed at or from the facility would amount to playing with fire, with potentially catastrophic consequences,\" Grossi said Saturday. \"And I condemn any violent acts carried out at or near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant or against its staff. The Ukrainian staff operating the plant under Russian occupation must be able to carry out their important duties without threats or pressure undermining not only their own safety but also that of the facility itself.\"\n\nGuterres, the U.N. chief, backed Grossi's push for the IAEA watchdogs to inspect the occupied facility.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"Any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,\" he said. \"And I hope that those attacks will end.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Monday that the Ukrainian attack Sunday caused a power surge, and smoke at its switch facility, triggering an emergency shutdown.

The facility continues to operate with Ukrainian staff under Russian control.\n\nOn Friday, Moscow accused Ukrainian troops of firing artillery shells at the plant, following allegations of several attempted drone attacks over the past month. A senior non-proliferation and arms control official at the Russian Foreign Ministry warned that the attacks on the plant risk triggering an event similar to the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said \"parts of the equipment\" at the plant were out of power due to the shelling, and a fire broke out at the facility and was quickly put out. The ministry claimed that \"by sheer luck,\" the Ukrainian shells did not cause a bigger fire and \"a possible nuclear disaster.\"\n\nUkrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, however, claimed that the shelling of the nuclear plant came from Russian troops themselves. On Saturday, Ukrainian media accused Moscow of another attack on the facility, claiming that a \"rocket attack\" damaged several radiation sensors and hurt a worker.\n\nAt the same time, officials in Kiev have been accusing Russia of using the plant as a \"military base.\" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken claimed last week that Moscow is using it as the \"equivalent of a human shield\" for its soldiers, \"knowing that [the Ukrainians] can't and won't shoot back.\" On Sunday, Zelensky urged Western governments to sanction Russia's nuclear industry over Moscow's supposed \"nuclear terrorism.\"", "source": {"uri": "northernirelandnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northern Ireland News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/rtc1659946413.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 6, "stanza_neu": 14, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 20, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7143773510", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "10:12:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T10:12:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T10:12:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "url": "https://www.chinadailyhk.com/article/284747#Ukrainian-EU-leaders-discuss-situation-at-nuclear-plant", "title": "Ukrainian, EU leaders discuss situation at nuclear plant", "body": "This April 27, 2022 file photo shows a general view of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the Russian-controlled area of Enerhodar, seen from Nikopol.

The Kremlin echoed that statement Monday, claiming that Ukrainian shelling could create \"catastrophic\" consequences for Europe.\n\nRafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has warned that the way the plant was being run under Russian forces and the fighting going on around it are posing grave health and environmental threats.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence chief, Andriy Yusov, countered the Russian statements by saying his organization had received credible information from several sources that Russian forces have planted explosives at the Zaporizhzhia plant to head off an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive in the region.

Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Monday that the Ukrainian attack a day earlier at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant caused a power surge and smoke erupted at its switch facility, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished the fire, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged Western powers to force Kyiv to stop attacking the plant.\n\n\"Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous,\" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. \"It's fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for the entire Europe.\"\n\nBut Yusov, Ukraine's military intelligence chief, said Monday: \"We have seen the Russian shelling of the Ukrainian nuclear power plant.\"\n\nHe added that, \"If it's not so, if it doesn't conform to reality, the Russians can make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA, if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nYusov said the Russians used similar tactics at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant when they had occupied it early in the war.\n\n\"This is a strategy of terror and scorched earth used by the Russians ahead of an inevitable Ukrainian counteroffensives in the south,\" he said.\n\nOn the high seas, meanwhile, the first of the ships to leave Ukraine under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis has arrived in Turkey. The Turkey-flagged Polarnet docked at the port of Derince in the Gulf of Izmit after setting off from the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk on Friday laden with 12,000 tons of corn.\n\n\"This sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Ukraine won't abandon you,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. \"If Russia sticks to its obligations, the 'grain corridor' will keep maintaining global food security.\"\n\nYet Polarnet Captain Ahmet Yucel Alibeyler highlighted the risks faced by grain-carrying ships trying to cross the Black Sea.\n\n\"These were, of course, dangerous areas, corridors that had been cleared, demined,\" he said.\n\nOn the front lines of the war, the Kremlin reasserted Monday that Russia will keep up its military attacks on Ukraine until it achieves its goals.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said Monday that the Russian military shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the past 24 hours, killing five people and wounding 20 more.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south of the country overnight, local officials said, again hitting a strategic bridge in the southern city of Kherson.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol, a Russian-controlled city in the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region, said Ukrainian forces used U.S. HIMARS rocket launchers to shell several facilities where the Russian military was stationed. Mayor Ivan Fyodorov said on Telegram that some 100 Russian troops were killed. His claims could not be independently verified, and the Russian military did not immediately comment.\n\nKirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region, said Monday morning that Ukrainian shelling again damaged the Antonivskiy bridge over the Dnieper River.\n\nThe bridge, a key artery for Russian military supplies, has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling and plans to reopen it on Wednesday were shelved due to the latest attack, Stremousov said.\n\nRussian forces also kept shelling Nikopol, a city just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine's presidential office said. Nikopol's gas pipelines, plumbing and power lines are no longer functioning, and thousands of people are left without electricity.\n\nA total of 12 ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- ten outbound and two headed for Ukraine. Some 322,000 metric tons of agricultural products have left Ukrainian ports, the bulk of it corn but also sunflower oil and soya.\n\nFour ships that left Ukraine on Sunday are expected to anchor near Istanbul on Monday evening and be inspected on Tuesday to make sure they are carrying only food items south and no weapons into Ukraine.\n\nBut the grain deal remains far from plain sailing. The first cargo ship to leave Ukraine, the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, left Odessa on Aug. 1 heading for Lebanon with 26,000 metric tons of corn for chicken feed. But it has run into a business dispute and will no longer dock in Lebanon, the Tripoli port chief told The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nUkraine's embassy in Beirut tweeted Monday that the corn's final buyer in Lebanon refused to accept the cargo due to the delivery delay beyond a contractual limit and that the shipper was now looking for another buyer for the corn.\n\nKareem Chehayeb in Beirut, Mehmet Guzel in Derince, Turkey, and Andrew Wilks in Istanbul contributed.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Previously, Ukrainian officials have said Russia is launching attacks from the plant and using Ukrainian workers there as human shields.\n\nYusov called on Russia to \"make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nUkraine's ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, likewise urged that the United Nations, the IAEA and the international community send a delegation to \"completely demilitarize the territory\" and provide security guarantees to plant employees and the city where the plant is based, Enerhodar.\n\nThe IAEA is the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog. Its director-general, Rafael Grossi, told The Associated Press last week that the situation surrounding the Zaporizhzhia plant \"is completely out of control,\" and issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to allow experts to visit the complex to stabilize the situation and avoid a nuclear accident.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced support for that idea Monday, saying, \"any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing.\"\n\nOne expert in nuclear materials at Imperial College London said the reactor at Zaporizhzhia is modern and housed inside a heavily reinforced steel-and-concrete building designed to protect against disasters.\n\n\"As such, I do not believe there would be a high probably of a breach of the containment building, even if it was accidently struck by an explosive shell, and even less likely the reactor itself could be damaged,\" said Mark Wenman at the college's Nuclear Energy Futures.\n\nHe also said the complex's spent fuel tanks, where the shells reportedly hit, are strong and probably don't contain much spent fuel.\n\n\"Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would be illegal according to international law, the likelihood of a serious nuclear release is still small,\" he said.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the attack Sunday caused a power surge and smoke, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished flames, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nAnd the head of the Ukrainian company operating the plant said all but one power line connecting it to Ukraine's energy system had been destroyed. Petro Kotin, head of the Ukrainian state corporation Eherhoatom, blamed Russian shelling and said a blackout would be \"very unsafe for such a nuclear facility.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy decried \"the shelling and mining\" of the plant and called it \"nuclear blackmail.\" He called for sanctions against Moscow's nuclear industry.\n\nAs fighting continued on the front lines, the United States on Monday pledged another $1 billion in new military aid for Ukraine. It would be the biggest delivery yet of rockets, ammunition and other arms straight from U.S. Department of Defense stocks for Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe latest announcement brings total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine by the Biden administration to $9.1 billion since Russian troops invaded on Feb. 24.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said the Russians had shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the previous 24 hours, killing five people. Among the targets, it said, was Nikopol, just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia plant. Thousands of people were without electricity there.\n\nRussian rockets and artillery also hit across the Sumy region, killing one person, and the Ukrainian governor of the eastern Donetsk region said the cities of Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Lyman had emerged as fighting hotspots.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south, officials there said, including the strategic Antonivskiy bridge in the southern city of Kherson. An artery for Russian military supplies, the bridge has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling. Plans to reopen it on Wednesday were now shelved, said Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the ships that left Ukraine on Friday under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis arrived in Turkey, the first loaded vessel to reach its destination. The Turkey-flagged Polarnet was laden with 12,000 tons of corn.\n\n\"This sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Ukraine won't abandon you,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. \"If Russia sticks to its obligations, the 'grain corridor' will keep maintaining global food security.\"\n\nTwelve ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- 10 outbound and two inbound.

The area, including the city of Kherson, is now the target of a Ukrainian counter-offensive. Ukraine appealed for the area around the complex to be demilitarised and for the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, to be let in. Russia said it too favoured an IAEA visit, which it accused Ukraine of blocking while trying to \"take Europe hostage\" by shelling the plant.\n\nUkraine blamed Russia for weekend attacks around the complex, which is still being run by Ukrainian technicians. It said three radiation sensors were damaged and two workers injured by shrapnel. As of Monday morning, the plant appeared to still be running, said Petro Kotin, head of Ukraine's state nuclear power company Energoatom. He said 500 Russian soldiers and 50 pieces of heavy machinery, including tanks, trucks and armoured infantry vehicles were at the site.\n\nThe Ukrainian staff at the plant had nowhere to shelter, he added. Reuters could not independently verify either side's account.\n\nKotin called for peacekeepers to run the Zaporizhzhia site, flagging the risk of shells hitting its six containers of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel. In an evening video shared online, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new Western sanctions on Russia's nuclear industry \"for creating the threat of a nuclear disaster.\" Dr Mark Wenman, a nuclear expert at Imperial College London, played down the risk of a major incident, saying the Zaporizhzhia reactors were relatively robust and the spent fuel well protected.\n\n\"Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would be illegal ...the likelihood of a serious nuclear release is still small,\" he said in a statement. WORKING UNDER 'RUSSIAN GUNS'\n\nThe world's worst civil nuclear disaster occurred in 1986 when a reactor at the Chornobyl complex in northwest Ukraine exploded. Soon after this year's Feb. 24 invasion, Russian troops occupied that site, withdrawing in late March. Ukraine has said it is planning to conduct a major counter-offensive around Kherson and that it has already retaken dozens of villages.\n\nGRAIN EXPORTS PICK UP Adding weight to a rare diplomatic success since the war began, a deal to unblock Ukraine's food exports and ease global shortages gathered pace as two grain ships carrying almost 59,000 tonnes of corn and soybeans sailed out of Ukrainian Black Sea ports.\n\nThat raised the total to 12 since the first vessel left a week ago. The July 22 grain export pact, brokered by Turkey and the United Nations, was further underpinned as the parties issued procedures for merchant ships carrying Ukrainian grain, including a 10-nautical-mile military exclusion zone, according to a document seen by Reuters.\n\nBefore the invasion, Russia and Ukraine together accounted for nearly a third of global wheat exports. Russia says it is waging a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine to rid it of nationalists and protect Russian-speaking communities. Ukraine and the West describe Russia's actions as an unprovoked war of aggression.\n\nThe conflict has displaced millions, killed thousands of civilians and left cities, towns and villages in ruins.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_18_18_10_5703828.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 18, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 27, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144235296", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "17:09:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T17:09:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T16:49:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.658823549747467, "url": "https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/attacking-nuclear-plant-suicidal-un-chief-tells-journalists-japan", "title": "Attacking a nuclear plant 'suicidal,' UN chief tells journalists in Japan -

Russia claimed that Ukrainian shelling caused a power surge and fire and forced staff to lower output from two reactors, while Ukraine has blamed Russian troops for storing weapons there.\n\nNuclear experts have warned that more shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which was captured by Russia early in the war, is fraught with danger. The Kremlin echoed that statement Monday, claiming that Ukrainian shelling could create \"catastrophic\" consequences for Europe.\n\nRafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has warned that the way the plant was being run under Russian forces and the fighting going on around it are posing grave health and environmental threats.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence chief, Andriy Yusov, countered the Russian statements by saying his organization had received credible information from several sources that Russian forces have planted explosives at the Zaporizhzhia plant to head off an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive in the region. Previously, Ukrainian officials have said Russia is launching attacks from the plant and using its Ukrainian workers as human shields.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Monday that the Ukrainian attack a day earlier at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant caused a power surge and smoke erupted at its switch facility, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished the fire, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged Western powers to force Kyiv to stop attacking the plant.\n\n\"Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous,\" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. \"It's fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for the entire Europe.\"\n\nBut Yusov, Ukraine's military intelligence chief, said Monday: \"We have seen the Russian shelling of the Ukrainian nuclear power plant.\"\n\nHe added that, \"If it's not so, if it doesn't conform to reality, the Russians can make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA, if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nYusov said the Russians used similar tactics at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant when they had occupied it early in the war.\n\n\"This is a strategy of terror and scorched earth used by the Russians ahead of an inevitable Ukrainian counteroffensives in the south,\" he said.\n\nOn the high seas, meanwhile, the first of the ships to leave Ukraine under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis has arrived in Turkey. The Turkey-flagged Polarnet docked at the port of Derince in the Gulf of Izmit after setting off from the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk on Friday laden with 12,000 tons of corn.\n\n\"This sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Ukraine won't abandon you,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. \"If Russia sticks to its obligations, the 'grain corridor' will keep maintaining global food security.\"\n\nYet Polarnet Captain Ahmet Yucel Alibeyler highlighted the risks faced by grain-carrying ships trying to cross the Black Sea.\n\n\"These were, of course, dangerous areas, corridors that had been cleared, demined,\" he said.\n\nOn the front lines of the war, the Kremlin reasserted Monday that Russia will keep up its military attacks on Ukraine until it achieves its goals.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said Monday that the Russian military shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the past 24 hours, killing five people and wounding 20 more.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south of the country overnight, local officials said, again hitting a strategic bridge in the southern city of Kherson.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol, a Russian-controlled city in the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region, said Ukrainian forces used U.S. HIMARS rocket launchers to shell several facilities where the Russian military was stationed. Mayor Ivan Fyodorov said on Telegram that some 100 Russian troops were killed. His claims could not be independently verified, and the Russian military did not immediately comment.\n\nKirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region, said Monday morning that Ukrainian shelling again damaged the Antonivskiy bridge over the Dnieper River.\n\nThe bridge, a key artery for Russian military supplies, has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling and plans to reopen it on Wednesday were shelved due to the latest attack, Stremousov said.\n\nRussian forces also kept shelling Nikopol, a city just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine's presidential office said. Nikopol's gas pipelines, plumbing and power lines are no longer functioning, and thousands of people are left without electricity.\n\nA total of 12 ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- ten outbound and two headed for Ukraine. Some 322,000 metric tons of agricultural products have left Ukrainian ports, the bulk of it corn but also sunflower oil and soya.\n\nFour ships that left Ukraine on Sunday are expected to anchor near Istanbul on Monday evening and be inspected on Tuesday to make sure they are carrying only food items south and no weapons into Ukraine.\n\nBut the grain deal remains far from plain sailing. The first cargo ship to leave Ukraine, the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, left Odessa on Aug. 1 heading for Lebanon with 26,000 metric tons of corn for chicken feed. But it has run into a business dispute and will no longer dock in Lebanon, the Tripoli port chief told The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nUkraine's embassy in Beirut tweeted Monday that the corn's final buyer in Lebanon refused to accept the cargo due to the delivery delay beyond a contractual limit and that the shipper was now looking for another buyer for the corn.\n\nKareem Chehayeb in Beirut, Mehmet Guzel in Derince, Turkey, and Andrew Wilks in Istanbul contributed.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Firefighters said they were prevented from reaching the blaze for hours.\n\nEnergoatom initially shut off two of the reactors - and more recently a third - but the plant has continued to be operated by Ukrainian technicians under Russian control.\n\nThe IAEA has repeatedly said it wants to organise an inspection of the plant.\n\nThis was initially opposed by Ukrainian authorities but officials have sounded less adamant about the prospect recently.\n\nRenewed fighting\n\nUkraine on 21 July accused Moscow of storing heavy weapons at the plant after Russia said Ukraine's troops had fired on the facility.\n\nEnergoatom said Russia had moved over two dozen pieces of military equipment and ammunition into the engine room of the first reactor.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Moscow was using it as a \"military base to fire at Ukrainians, knowing that they can't and won't shoot back\".\n\nOn 5 August, Ukraine accused Russian forces of carrying out strikes near a reactor. Russia said Ukraine was behind them.\n\nFollowing the attacks, Energoatom said it would have to shut down another reactor because of damage to a power cable.\n\nAnother reactor is being repaired, meaning only two reactors are now functioning.\n\nUkraine says there are around 500 Russian troops at the plant and has called for the establishment of a demilitarised zone.\n\nDespite the tensions, Energoatom has said it is still in contact with the plant and receives data on radiation monitoring.\n\nIt said on Monday that there had been no change to radiation levels.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news24"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3388/335b163a456e48b7a0d49b314f49c341.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 3, "stanza_neu": 21, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 27, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7145224819", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-09", "time": "12:52:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-09T12:52:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-09T12:30:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "url": "https://www.startribune.com/ukraine-shelling-hits-town-near-russian-held-nuclear-plant/600196827/", "title": "Ukraine: Shelling hits town near Russian-held nuclear plant", "body": "KYIV, Ukraine -- At least three Ukrainian civilians were killed and 23 others wounded by Russian shelling in 24 hours, including an attack not far from a Russian-occupied nuclear power plant, the office of Ukraine's president reported Tuesday.\n\nThe Russians fired over 120 rockets from Grad multiple rocket launchers at the southern town of Nikopol, which is across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Dnipropetrovsk Gov. Valentyn Reznichenko said. Several apartment buildings and industrial facilities were damaged, he said.\n\nUkraine and Russia accused each other in recent days of shelling the nuclear plant, which is the largest one in Europe, and increasing the risks of a nuclear accident.\n\nIn his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy invoked the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine, which at the time was a Soviet republic. He called for new sanctions against Russia \"for creating the threat\" of another nuclear disaster.\n\n\"We are actively informing the world about Russian nuclear blackmail -- about the shelling and mining of the Zaporizhzhia NPP facilities,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Russia will not pay attention to words and concerns ... The Chernobyl disaster is an explosion in one reactor; the Zaporizhzhia NPP is six power units.\"\n\nThe Kremlin claimed Monday that Ukraine's military was attacking the plant and urged Western powers to force Kyiv to stop the activity.\n\nA Russian-installed official in the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia region said an air defense system at the plant would be reinforced in the aftermath of last week's shelling. Evgeny Balitsky, the head of the Kremlin-backed administration, told Russian state TV Tuesday that power lines and damaged blocks of the plant were restored.\n\n\"The plant is operating normally, but, of course, with an increased degree of security,\" Balitsky said.\n\nA Ukrainian counteroffensive and Russian defensive actions in occupied areas have increasingly drawn firepower to southern Ukraine.\n\nDrones are playing a crucial role in Ukraine's military operations in the southern Mykolaiv region where Russian shelling has been escalating in recent weeks.\n\nThe leader of a Ukrainian reconnaissance team named \"Fireflies\" -- who goes by the nom de guerre \"Baton\" -- said his unit is using drones to monitor and combat any Russian attempt to seize more territory in the region.\n\n\"This is a war of artillery and drones,\" Baton told reporters, as he observed smoke rising after an attack on a Russian position a few kilometers away on a monitor with the feed sent from the vehicle.\n\nDrones are the only \"eyes,\" Baton said.\n\nAfter failing to capture Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, early in the war, the Russian military focused its strength on trying to seize all of the country's eastern Donbas region. Pro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the region for eight years and control some territory as self-proclaimed republics.\n\nThe British Defense Ministry said Tuesday that Russian forces had made the most progress in the past month in moving toward the town of Bakhmut -- an advance limited to about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles).\n\n\"In other Donbas sectors where Russia was attempting to break through, its forces have not gained more than 3 km during this 30-day period; almost certainly significantly less than planned,\" the U.K. ministry said.\n\nHowever, the ministry cautioned that despite the attention required in southern Ukraine, Russia had maintained attacks on Ukrainian positions in the east.\n\nThe governor of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk province, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said the Russians were trying to press their offensive in several areas. Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, came under Russian shelling four times over the past 24 hours, and some city infrastructure was damaged.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1659992858", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 17, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 27, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144158783", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "15:56:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T15:56:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T15:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19451169/russia-blow-up-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant/", "title": "Russia 'threatening to blow up nuke plant with explosives', claims Ukraine", "body": "RUSSIA has threatened to blow up Europe's largest nuclear power plant and planted explosives on the site, Ukraine has claimed.\n\nState-run nuclear agency Energoatom accused Vladimir Putin's forces of being \"ready to blow up\" the atomic plant in Zaporizhzhia (ZNPP).\n\nRussia and Ukraine have both accused the other of shelling around the plant in recent days and damaging radiation sensors.\n\nThe fears of a nuclear catastrophe similar to Chernobyl are looming over the war-torn country with accusations of \"nuclear blackmail\".\n\nIt has been long feared that Russia wants to use ZNPP - the biggest nuke plant in Europe - as strategic leverage, a \"nuclear shield\", and to control part of the energy to southern Ukraine.\n\nEnergoatom has now outright accused Russia of \"declaring their readiness to blow up\" Zaporizhzhia.\n\nThe claim - which has not been independently verified - would be a significant escalation in the area, with the situation already being branded \"suicidal\" and \"out of control\".\n\nBlowing up the nuclear power plant could cause a nuclear disaster across Ukraine, southern Russia and that could reach into Europe.\n\n\"If [ZNPP] blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chernobyl,\" Ukraine foreign minister warned in April.\n\nRadiation from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 left more than 77,000 square miles of land contaminated - and the fallout cloud was even detected in the UK.\n\nUkrainian news agencies have also picked on the claims, which cite without source remarks by Russian Major General Valery Vasiliev.\n\nIt is reported the Russian commander boasted that around ZNPP \"there will either [be] Russian land or a scorched desert\".\n\nKyiv channels accused Russia of planting explosives at the plant, including on key infrasture.\n\nAgain, these claims have not been verified and are at this stage accusations levied at Russia by Ukraine.\n\nGeneral Vasiliev reportedly said: \"We mined all the important objects of the [ZNPP].\n\n\"And we do not hide this from the enemy. We warned them.\n\n\"The enemy knows that the station will be either Russian or nobody's. We are ready for the consequences of this step.\"\n\nHe added: \"If there is the most severe order - we must fulfill it with honor.\"\n\nThe quotes have been widely shared by Ukrainian media and officials, but their source remains unclear.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser in Volodymyr Zelensky's office, said: \"[Russia] now openly uses nuclear blackmailing at the Zaporizhzhya NPP.\"\n\nHe added: \"Europe is under threat.\"\n\nThe Sun Online has contacted the UK Ministry of Defence and the Russian Embassy in London for comment on the claims.\n\nUkraine's Centre for Strategic Communications and Information Security also repeated the accusations.\n\n\"Russian troops have wired energy units of Zaporizhia nuclear power plant with explosives,\" it said.\n\n\"Major General Vasilyev, commander of the garrison stationed at the plant, announced readiness to blow up the plant, leading to a nuclear catastrophe.\"\n\nAnd meanwhile, Ukrainian official Anton Gerashchenko said it was \"nuclear blackmail for the whole world\".\n\nSpeaking earlier today, Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, called for the ZNPP to be made a military free zone.\n\nAnd he warned shelling around the plant risks a \"Chernobyl-style nuclear disaster\".\n\nHe called for a team of peacekeepers to be deployed at the site in comments on television.\n\nMr Kotin said: \"If one container of spent nuclear fuel is broken, it will be a local accident in the plant and the surrounding area.\n\n\"If there are two or three containers, it will be much larger. It is impossible to assess the scale of this catastrophe.\"\n\nHe described the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) reaction to the situation at the site over the last five months as \"sluggish\", but said there were signs that that was changing.\n\n\"Now there is movement in their position, and we hope that the situation will be taken under the control of international organisations,\" he said.\n\nKotin said 500 Russian soldiers and 50 pieces of heavy machinery including tanks, trucks and armoured infantry vehicles were at the site.\n\nTwo people were wounded by shrapnel during the shelling and were in hospital, he said - and claimed Ukrainians on site were given no where to shelter.\n\nRussia has said it was ready to facility a visit by the IAEA to the ZNPP.\n\nIt comes after UN chief Antonio Guterres warned the world is starting down the \"loaded gun\" of nuclear armageddon.\n\nHe used his visit the Japanese city of Hiroshoma on the 77th anniversary of the first atomic bomb attack to sound the alarm.\n\n\"We must ask: What have we learned from the mushroom cloud that swelled above this city?\" he said.\n\n\"Humanity is playing with a loaded gun.\"\n\nAnd elsewhere, British general Sir Richard Barrons warned that Putin is \"likely\" to turn his warn in Ukraine nuclear if he thinks he might lose.\n\nThe decorated commander - who retired in 2016 - explained that the Russian doctrine accepts the use of small nuclear weapons as a means of \"coercion\".\n\n\"It would be the first use of nuclear weapons for 77 years, breaking an enormous taboo, but this is not inconceivable to Russians if the ends justify it in their eyes,\" he wrote in The Sunday Times.\n\nSir Richard warned the West needs to consider the fact Putin is now \"likely to employ tactical nuclear weapons\" if he faces being pushed back.\n\nHe explained that a Russian nuclear strike in Ukraine would not be using massive city-killing bombs which could completely level parts of London or New York.\n\nRussian doctrine instead demands smaller weapons for such battlefield use - possibly less powerful than the nukes dropped by the US as the end of World War 2.\n\nEven the comparably \"small\" size of these weapons - the Fat Man and Little Boy - killed more than 200,000 people and wrought unspeakable horrors on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nPutin had hoped his war would be over in a matter of days, with it suggested he could potentially launch a blitzkrieg assault to seize Kyiv.\n\nBut this never happened - and some 164 days on the war continues to be a bloody, brutal and grinding conflict laced with unspeakable atrocities committed by the Russians.\n\nAnd with every day, week and month that sleeps by, the looming shadow of nuclear war is cast long over Ukraine.\n\nMoscow's war doctrine is believed to be open to using nuclear weapons in a conventional conflict as an intimidation tactic - and use of such a weapon must be signed off personally by Putin.\n\nWestern nations continue to support Kyiv in its fight against Putin with weapons and aid - but the ongoing conflict has plunged the world into tensions not seen since the Cold War.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "henry_holloway@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Henry Holloway", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000752361915.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 22, "stanza_neu": 34, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 56, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7143571367", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "07:04:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T07:04:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T06:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "url": "https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/russia-highly-likely-using-indiscriminate-063703144.html", "title": "Russia 'highly likely' to be using indiscriminate 'butterfly mines' in eastern Ukraine, UK warns", "body": "Russia is highly likely to be using so-called \"butterfly mines\" in eastern Ukraine that are capable of inflicting widespread civilian casualties, UK defence chiefs claimed on Monday.\n\nIn its latest intelligence update, the Ministry of Defence warned Vladimir Putin's forces were probably deploying anti-peronnel mines to \"protect and deter freedom of movement along its defensive lines in the Donbas\".\n\nDefence chiefs said they can inflict widespread casualities amongst both the military and local residents.\n\n\"In Donetsk and Kramatorsk, Russia has highly likely attempted employment of PFM-1 and PFM-15 scatterable anti-personally mines,\" they claimed.\n\n\"Commonly called the 'butterfly mine', the PFM-1 series are deeply controversial, indiscriminate weapons\n\n\"PFM-1s were used to devastating effect in the Soviet-Afghan War where they allegedly maimed high numbers of children who mistook them for toys.\n\n\"It is highly likely that the Soviet-era stock being used by Russia will have degraded over time and are now highly unreliable and unpredictable.\n\n\"This poses a threat to both the local population and humanitarian mine clearance operations.\"\n\nAlso known as green parrot mines, PFMs can be deployed from mortars, helicopters and planes and glide to the ground without exploding.\n\nVladimir Putin's troops are trying to gain full control of the Donbas region of east Ukraine where pro-Moscow separatists seized territory after the Kremlin annexed Crimea to the south in 2014.\n\nRussian forces stepped up their attacks north and northwest of Donetsk city in the Donbas on Sunday, Ukraine's military said.

Here, controlled nuclear reactions create enough heat to turn water into steam, which is then used to create energy.\n\nThere are two types - boiling water reactors and pressurised water reactors.\n\nZaporizhzhia is home to the latter, which are much safer than the former ones used at the Chernobyl site, where the 1984 disaster resulted in a huge radiation leak and dozens of direct and indirect deaths.\n\nProfessor Claire Corkhill, chair in nuclear material degradation at the University of Sheffield, told Sky News: \"After Chernobyl, there were lots of lessons learned.\n\n\"One of the main ones was that reactors should be contained in very robust buildings, so now they are built in huge reinforced concrete containers.\n\n\"A plane could fly into those buildings and they wouldn't be damaged.\"\n\nThe reactors also feature built-in fire defences and if the electricity supply to them fails, they have back-up generators powered by diesel that last around three days.\n\nOther infrastructure still at risk\n\nThere are still other parts of the plant that are vulnerable to damage, however.\n\nOnce the radioactive fuel inside the reactor has been used to its full capacity it is placed in a large cooling pond for around two years before being transferred to a dry storage facility.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian nuclear regulator Energoatom, Saturday's strikes damaged three radiation monitors at one of the storage facilities for spent fuel.\n\nProfessor Corkhill says: \"A missile strike to the cooling pond building is of concern as the water is highly radioactive and a leak could spread radioactivity in the local area.\n\n\"A strike to the dry cask storage is less concerning, as the nuclear fuel is well protected by thick metal and concrete containers.\"\n\nBut as Tony Roulstone, lecturer in nuclear energy at Cambridge University, warns, a direct strike on either could still cause a leak.\n\n\"Those reinforcements are not designed against military grade-weapons,\" he said.\n\n\"This plant has got caught up in a war zone - and nuclear power and warfare don't mix.\"\n\nEach strike removes a vital safety defence\n\nWhen Friday's shelling hit a power line to the plant, the reactor was shut down as a safety measure.\n\nBut Mr Roulstone cautions that in the context of a war, once on-site diesel supplies run out, getting more could prove difficult.\n\n\"There are in-depth defences at any nuclear power plant,\" he said.\n\n\"But when you have collateral damage, you remove one or more of those defences and therefore increase the risk.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Ukraine War Diaries on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify and Spreaker\n\nProfessor Corkhill agrees, adding: \"The more missiles you fire in direction of a nuclear power plant, the higher the risk is of a catastrophic nuclear accident.\n\n\"If the electricity supply is damaged, but the diesel-powered generators are operational, it gives enough time to put the reactor into cold shutdown - essentially switch the reactor off and make it safe before a meltdown can happen.\n\n\"But if the electricity supply and the back-up generators are damaged, then the likelihood of an accident is very high.\n\n\"The Fukushima accident spread radioactivity over hundreds of kilometres - so the same could happen at Zaporizhzhia.\"\n\nDepending on the size of the leak, it could mean thousands of people evacuated from their homes and their health put at major risk from dangerous levels of radiation.\n\nIf all the nuclear reactors at the plant have to shut down, millions already struggling would be left without electricity.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/22/08/1600x900/skynews-russia-ukraine-power_5858379.jpg?20220808120221", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 25, "stanza_neu": 22, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 49, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7143849728", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "11:19:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T11:19:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T11:11:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "url": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/headlines/2137200-wrapup-6-ukraine-calls-for-demilitarised-zone-around-nuclear-plant-hit-by-shelling", "title": "WRAPUP 6-Ukraine calls for demilitarised zone around nuclear plant hit by shelling | Headlines", "body": "\"Any attack (on) a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,\" U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres told a news conference on Monday in Japan, where he attended the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony on Saturday to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing. Petro Kotin, head of Ukraine's state nuclear power company Energoatom, called for a team of peacekeepers to be deployed at the Zaporizhzhia site, which is still run by Ukrainian technicians.\n\n\"The decision that we demand from the world community and all our partners ... is to withdraw the invaders from the territory of the station and create a demilitarised zone on the territory of the station,\" Kotin said on television. \"The presence of peacekeepers in this zone and the transfer of control of it to them, and then also control of the station to the Ukrainian side would resolve this problem.\"\n\nRussia's defence ministry said on Monday that Ukrainian shelling had damaged high-voltage power lines servicing the Soviet-era plant and forced it to reduce output by two of its six reactors to \"prevent disruption\". A Russian-installed official in the Zaporizhzhia region said earlier that the facility was operating normally.\n\nUkraine blamed Russia for renewed shelling in the area of the plant that it said damaged three radiation sensors, with two workers hospitalised for shrapnel injuries. The Zaporizhzhia region's Russian-installed authority said Ukrainian forces hit the site with a multiple rocket launcher, damaging administrative buildings and a storage area.\n\nReuters could not verify either side's version of what happened. In a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the shelling was \"extremely dangerous\" and added: \"We expect the countries that have absolute influence on the Ukrainian leadership to use this influence in order to rule out the continuation of such shelling.\"\n\nUkraine's Kotin flagged the danger of shells hitting spent containers of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel as especially dire. If two or more containers were broken, \"it is impossible to assess the scale of this catastrophe\". The world's worst civil nuclear disaster occurred in 1986 when a reactor at the Chornobyl complex in northwest Ukraine exploded. The plant was occupied by Russian forces soon after the Feb. 24 invasion before they withdrew in late March.\n\nGuterres said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) needed access to the Zaporizhzhia plant. \"We fully support the IAEA in all their efforts in relation to creat(ing) the conditions for stabilisation of the plant,\" he said. Ukraine has said it is planning to conduct a major counter-offensive in the Russian-occupied south, apparently focused on the city of Kherson, west of Zaporizhzhia, and that it has already retaken dozens of villages.\n\nGRAIN EXPORTS PICK UP STEAM Elsewhere, a deal to unblock Ukraine's food exports and ease global shortages gathered pace as two grain ships sailed out of Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Monday, raising the total to 12 since the first vessel left a week ago.\n\nThe two latest outgoing ships were carrying almost 59,000 tonnes of corn and soybeans and were bound for Italy and southeastern Turkey. The four that left on Sunday bore almost 170,000 tonnes of corn and other food. The July 22 grain export pact brokered by Turkey and the United Nations represents a rare diplomatic triumph as fighting churns on in Ukraine and aims to help ease soaring global food prices arising from the war.\n\nBefore the invasion, Russia and Ukraine together accounted for nearly a third of global wheat exports. The disruption since then has raised the spectre of famine in parts of the world. Ukraine has said it hopes to export 20 million tonnes of grain in silos and 40 million from its new harvest to help rebuild its wrecked economy.\n\nRussia says it is waging a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine to rid it of nationalists and protect Russian-speaking communities. Ukraine and the West describe Russia's actions as an unprovoked imperial-style war to reassert control over a pro-Western neighbour lost when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The conflict has displaced millions, killed thousands of civilians and left cities, towns and villages in ruins.\n\nRussian forces are trying to gain full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region where pro-Moscow separatists seized territory after the Kremlin annexed Crimea to the south in 2014. \"Ukrainian soldiers are firmly holding the defence, inflicting losses on the enemy and are ready for any changes in the operational situation,\" Ukraine's general staff said in an operational update on Monday.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a

Ukrainian forces Monday of firing on Europe's largest nuclear power plant in occupied Ukraine and warned the alleged attacks could have \"catastrophic consequences\".\n\nKyiv said Moscow was responsible and called for the area to be demilitarised, adding that two employees had been wounded in recent attacks.\n\nFighting continued meanwhile along battle lines stretching across eastern Ukraine, and Russia continued its crackdown on dissent at home.\n\nEach side has blamed the other for the escalation in fighting around the nuclear facility in Zaporizhzhia in southeastern Ukraine, which was captured by Russian forces soon after their late February invasion.\n\nRecent fighting at the plant has prompted the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to warn of \"the very real risk of a nuclear disaster\".\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky also raised the spectre of a catastrophe in his nightly address Monday, invoking the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.\n\n\"The world should not forget about Chernobyl and should remember that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is the biggest in Europe,\" Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine said the plant should be cleared of Russian forces and called for the establishment of an international security and energy team to oversee the site.\n\n\"What needs to be done is to remove occupying forces from the station and to create a de-militarised zone on the territory of the station,\" said Petro Kotin, president of Ukraine's nuclear energy company, Energoatom.\n\n\"There should be a peacekeeping mission including experts from the IAEA and other security organisations,\" he added.\n\n\"Their presence and initially giving control to them and then to the Ukrainian side would have solved this problem\".\n\n- 'Nuclear terrorism' -\n\nKotin said Russia had deployed some 500 Russian troops and 50 pieces of hardware including tanks at Zaporizhzhia, echoing earlier claims from Kyiv that Moscow was using the site for military cover.\n\nUkraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmygal meanwhile accused Russia of \"nuclear terrorism,\" urging the world to \"unite now to prevent a catastrophe\".\n\nThe Kremlin has captured swathes of Ukrainian territory since February, introducing Russian currency and announcing plans to formally annex the areas by holding votes, including in the Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nThe head of its Moscow-installed administration Yevgeny Balitsky said on social media Monday he had signed a decree \"on the issue of organising a referendum on the reunification of the Zaporizhzhia region with the Russian Federation\".\n\nThe plans follow a similar move by Moscow in 2014 after it annexed the Crimean peninsula, a highly controversial vote that has not been recognised by most Western countries.\n\nAs Russian forces continued shelling across the sprawling eastern frontline, one woman was killed and four more were injured in the Kharkiv region in the northeast, Kyiv said.\n\nUkrainian forces in turn said they had bombed a strategic bridge over the Dnipro river overnight in the Russian-held city of Kherson in the south.\n\nMore than five months of fighting has taken a heavy toll on Russian forces, with up to 80,000 of Moscow's troops killed or wounded and 3-4,000 armoured vehicles lost, a senior Pentagon official said Monday.\n\nThere were also fresh pledges of Western aid.\n\nThe Pentagon announced military aid for Ukraine worth $1 billion including additional precision ammunition for the Himars system that has helped Kyiv's forces attack Russian troops far behind the front lines.\n\nThe World Bank said it was mobilising another $4.5 billion in US-provided financial support to help Kyiv pay for services and pensions, key to easing the invasion's economic impacts.\n\nBut the United Nations said Monday that more than 17 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance due to the Ukraine conflict, and increased an appeal for funds to respond to the crisis from $2.25 billion to $4.3 billion.\n\n- Fresh fine for journalist -\n\nThe authorities in Moscow pursued their crackdown on opposition to the war, handing down a new fine to journalist Marina Ovsyannikova.\n\nOvsyannikova shot to prominence in March for interrupting a live broadcast to denounce Russia's military intervention in Ukraine.\n\nOn Monday, her lawyer did not rule out the possibility of her facing another criminal probe.\n\nA Ukrainian court meanwhile jailed a Russian tank crewman for 10 years for firing on a multi-storied apartment block in the northern city of Chernigiv early on in the invasion, according to authorities in Kyiv.\n\nSecurity officials also said they arrested Russian agents who were planning to assassinate the defence minister and the military intelligence chief.\n\nThere was progress on one rare area of compromise between Russian and Ukraine Monday, after the first cargo ship that left a Ukrainian port reached its final destination under a recent deal brokered by Ankara and the UN docked in Turkey.\n\nWhile Kyiv welcomed the news, officials also said there was a delay in the first delivery to leave Ukrainian ports because the buyer had refused delivery, citing a five-month delay in shipment.", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS)"}, "authors":

Evgeny Balitsky, the head of the Kremlin-backed administration, told Russian state TV Tuesday that power lines and damaged blocks of the plant were restored.\n\n\"The plant is operating normally, but, of course, with an increased degree of security,\" Balitsky said.\n\nA Ukrainian counteroffensive and Russian defensive actions in occupied areas has increasingly drawn firepower to southern Ukraine.\n\nAfter failing to capture Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, early in the war, the Russian military focused its strength on trying to seize all of the country's eastern Donbas region. Pro-Moscow separatists have fought Russian forces in the region for eight years and control some territory as self-proclaimed republics.\n\nThe British Defense Ministry said Tuesday that Russian forces had made the most progress in the past month in moving toward the town of Bakhmut - an advance limited to about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles).\n\n\"In other Donbas sectors where Russia was attempting to break through, its forces have not gained more than 3 km during this 30-day period; almost certainly significantly less than planned,\" the U.K. ministry said.\n\nHowever, the ministry cautioned that despite the attention required in southern Ukraine, Russia had maintained attacks on Ukrainian positions in the east.\n\nThe governor of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk province, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said the Russians were trying to press their offensive in several areas.

Damage to three radiation detectors makes it impossible to determine whether any radiation had leaked. The statement added that none of the casks containing spent fuel appeared to be damaged, meaning that the site probably remained safe, but its safety could not be guaranteed with additional strikes.\n\n\"This time a nuclear catastrophe was miraculously avoided,\" the statement read. \"But miracles cannot last forever. The actions of [Russian forces] must be urgently put to an end in order to protect Ukraine and the world from a nuclear disaster.\"\n\nThe Russian military immediately denied attacking the site, asserting that it occupied the site, thus unlikely to fire on its own troops, and claiming that a Ukrainian rocket strike caused the damage. However, Energoatom also alleged that the Russian forces present at the facility had entered a bunker before the shelling, suggesting advanced knowledge of the attack.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky discussed the Zaporizhzhia strike in his nightly video address, describing it as an instance of \"Russian nuclear terror\" and calling for further international sanctions on the Kremlin.

Long convoys of Russian military trucks, tanks, artillery and other things continue to move from the Donbas to the south-west,\" said the UK's defence ministry, confirming early assertions by Ukraine's deputy military intelligence chief.\n\nAccording to a separate source with Ukraine's military intelligence, Russian forces are creating fire damage along the frontlines in the occupied Kherson region to stop Ukrainian forces from pushing out of their positions, and adding more units to attack Mykolaiv and south Dnipropetrovsk region, as well as conducting aerial reconnaissance of the area with drones. In occupied Zaporizhzhia region, the Russians are actively attacking Ukrainian troops while bringing in new units to strengthen their numbers, according to the same source.\n\nOne of the major obstacles to Ukraine's offensive in the south could be the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, Europe's largest, which was shelled on Saturday. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said it was a crime and \"an act of terror\", saying the shelling was carried out by Russian forces. In a phone call on Sunday with the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, about the plant, Zelenskiy called for sanctions on Russia's nuclear industry and nuclear fuel in response.\n\nBut the head of Zaporizhzhia's occupying authorities, Evgeniy Balitskyi, said that Ukrainian forces were to blame and had \"decided to put the whole of Europe on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe\" by shelling the plant.\n\nIt was not possible on Saturday to independently determine which side was responsible for the attack on the power station.\n\nUkraine says Russia has turned the plant into a military base, making it extremely hard to target the Russian troops and equipment inside. According to the New York Times, Russia has been using the plant as cover from which to fire on Ukrainian forces since mid-July.\n\nThe Washington-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessed on 3 August that Russian forces were likely to be using the power plant to \"play on western fears of a nuclear disaster in Ukraine in an effort to degrade western will to provide military support to a Ukrainian counteroffensive\". The ISW further said that Russia was \"effectively using the plant as a nuclear shield to prevent Ukrainian strikes on Russian forces and equipment\".\n\nUkraine's nuclear power agency, Energoatom, said that containers of spent fuel had been hit in the latest shelling, damaging three radiation monitoring sensors and injuring one employee. Spent fuel is highly radioactive, according to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In a statement on Telegram, Energoatom said the damage meant it was currently impossible to detect increased radiation or leakage of radiation from the spent fuel containers.\n\nThe UN nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to all military action near the plant. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said the size of the plant \"underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster that could threaten public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond\".\n\nThe UK's defence ministry predicts Russia's war in Ukraine will soon enter a \"new phase\" as it believes the fighting will shift from Donbas to a 217-mile front stretching south-west from near Zaporizhzhia to Kherson.\n\nAt present, the brunt of Russia's attacks is around what remains of Ukrainian-controlled eastern Donbas. Russian forces are still trying to achieve their aim of capturing the whole of Donbas. Russian forces now control Luhansk oblast, with the exception of a few small settlements, and about half of Donetsk oblast.\n\nRussia is currently carrying out two offensives to capture the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka and continuing to shell dozens of towns and villages from all directions, according to a statement by Ukraine's general staff.\n\nRussian forces now appear to be occupying the southern part of Pisky, a village in Donetsk oblast near Avdivvka, as well as the small settlement of Travneve, 11 miles south of Bakhmut, according to the ISW, which reported that the Ukrainian army seemed to be holding the line elsewhere.\n\nUkraine's general staff said on Sunday that Russia was deploying troops and air defence systems to Belarus. However, the same Ukrainian military intelligence source said no offensive formations had been detected in Belarus, though rocket attacks from its northern neighbour continued to be a threat.\n\nMeanwhile, four more ships successfully left Ukraine's ports, raising hopes that the deal brokered by Turkey and the UN to end Russia's blockade of Ukraine's ports might hold. Russia's decision to strike Odesa port hours after the deal was signed cast doubt on that.\n\nThe deal is valid for 120 days and can be renewed if both sides agree.

accuses Kyiv of shelling nuclear plant", "body": "KYIV, Aug 9 -- The Kremlin accused Ukrainian forces yesterday of firing on Europe's largest nuclear power plant in occupied Ukraine and warned the alleged attacks could have \"catastrophic consequences\".\n\nKyiv said Moscow was responsible and called for the area to be demilitarised, adding that two employees had been wounded in recent attacks.\n\nFighting continued meanwhile along battle lines stretching across eastern Ukraine, and Russia continued its crackdown on dissent at home.\n\nEach side has blamed the other for the escalation in fighting around the nuclear facility in Zaporizhzhia in southeastern Ukraine, which was captured by Russian forces soon after their late February invasion.\n\nRecent fighting at the plant has prompted the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to warn of \"the very real risk of a nuclear disaster\".\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky also raised the spectre of a catastrophe in his nightly address Monday, invoking the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.\n\n\"The world should not forget about Chernobyl and should remember that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is the biggest in Europe,\" Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine said the plant should be cleared of Russian forces and called for the establishment of an international security and energy team to oversee the site.\n\n\"What needs to be done is to remove occupying forces from the station and to create a de-militarised zone on the territory of the station,\" said Petro Kotin, president of Ukraine's nuclear energy company, Energoatom.\n\n\"There should be a peacekeeping mission including experts from the IAEA and other security organisations,\" he added.\n\n\"Their presence and initially giving control to them and then to the Ukrainian side would have solved this problem\".\n\n'Nuclear terrorism'\n\nKotin said Russia had deployed some 500 Russian troops and 50 pieces of hardware including tanks at Zaporizhzhia, echoing earlier claims from Kyiv that Moscow was using the site for military cover.\n\nUkraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmygal meanwhile accused Russia of \"nuclear terrorism,\" urging the world to \"unite now to prevent a catastrophe\".\n\nThe Kremlin has captured swathes of Ukrainian territory since February, introducing Russian currency and announcing plans to formally annex the areas by holding votes, including in the Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nThe head of its Moscow-installed administration Yevgeny Balitsky said on social media yesterday he had signed a decree \"on the issue of organising a referendum on the reunification of the Zaporizhzhia region with the Russian Federation\".\n\nThe plans follow a similar move by Moscow in 2014 after it annexed the Crimean peninsula, a highly controversial vote that has not been recognised by most Western countries.\n\nAs Russian forces continued shelling across the sprawling eastern frontline, one woman was killed and four more were injured in the Kharkiv region in the northeast, Kyiv said.\n\nUkrainian forces in turn said they had bombed a strategic bridge over the Dnipro river overnight in the Russian-held city of Kherson in the south.\n\nMore than five months of fighting has taken a heavy toll on Russian forces, with up to 80,000 of Moscow's troops killed or wounded and 3-4,000 armoured vehicles lost, a senior Pentagon official said yesterday.\n\nThere were also fresh pledges of Western aid.\n\nThe Pentagon announced military aid for Ukraine worth US$1 billion (RM4.45 billion) including additional precision ammunition for the Himars system that has helped Kyiv's forces attack Russian troops far behind the front lines.\n\nThe World Bank said it was mobilising another US$4.5 billion in US-provided financial support to help Kyiv pay for services and pensions, key to easing the invasion's economic impacts.\n\nBut the United Nations said Monday that more than 17 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance due to the Ukraine conflict, and increased an appeal for funds to respond to the crisis from US$2.25 billion to US$4.3 billion.\n\nFresh fine for journalist\n\nThe authorities in Moscow pursued their crackdown on opposition to the war, handing down a new fine to journalist Marina Ovsyannikova.\n\nOvsyannikova shot to prominence in March for interrupting a live broadcast to denounce Russia's military intervention in Ukraine.\n\nYesterday, her lawyer did not rule out the possibility of her facing another criminal probe.\n\nA Ukrainian court meanwhile jailed a Russian tank crewman for 10 years for firing on a multi-storied apartment block in the northern city of Chernigiv early on in the invasion, according to authorities in Kyiv.\n\nSecurity officials also said they arrested Russian agents who were planning to assassinate the defence minister and the military intelligence chief.\n\nThere was progress on one rare area of compromise between Russian and Ukraine Monday, after the first cargo ship that left a Ukrainian port reached its final destination under a recent deal brokered by Ankara and the UN docked in Turkey.\n\nWhile Kyiv welcomed the news, officials also said there was a delay in the first delivery to leave Ukrainian ports because the buyer had refused delivery, citing a five-month delay in shipment. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors": [], "image":

The statement was made by the Russian embassy in the United States. Located in southern Ukraine, the ZNPP is the largest nuclear plant in Europe and has been occupied by Russia since March this year. The Russian embassy also urged American media to refrain from mentioning the attack on the nuclear plant in their \"Russophobic\" approach.\n\n\"We drew attention to the disinformation campaign unfolding in the local media in order to attribute responsibility to our country for the situation with the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It is stated indiscriminately that the Russian military carried out artillery strikes on the territory of the nuclear power plant. The real state of affairs is exactly the opposite,\" the embassy stated on Telegram. It also accused the Ukrainian Armed Forces of intentionally shelling the nuclear plant in order to shift the blame on Russia.\n\nThe Russian embassy further stated, \"We note that this is not the first provocation of Kyiv at radiation-hazardous facilities. In order to discredit Russia, the Ukrainian authorities do not disdain anything, creating a real threat to nuclear security not only in Ukraine but also in Europe.\" According to the Interdepartmental Coordinating Headquarters of the Russian Federation for Humanitarian Response in Kyiv, Ukrainian forces fired artillery shells on the territory of the specified facility on August 5. It further claimed that at least two high-voltage power lines and a water pipe were damaged as a result of the shelling.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that the war between Russia and Ukraine has been continuing for well over five months now with no sign of ending anytime soon.

Previously, Ukrainian officials have said Russia is launching attacks from the plant and using its Ukrainian workers as human shields.\n\nBefore Sunday's shelling, the nuclear plant came under fire last week and each side accused the other of the attack.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Monday that the Ukrainian attack a day earlier at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant caused a power surge and smoke erupted at its switch facility, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished the fire, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged Western powers to force Kyiv to stop attacking the plant.\n\n\"Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous,\" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. \"It's fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for the entire Europe.\"\n\nBut Yusov, Ukraine's military intelligence chief, said Monday: \"We have seen the Russian shelling of the Ukrainian nuclear power plant.\"\n\nHe added that, \"If it's not so, if it doesn't conform to reality, the Russians can make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA, if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nYusov said the Russians used similar tactics at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant when they had occupied it early in the war.\n\n\"This is a strategy of terror and scorched earth used by the Russians ahead of an inevitable Ukrainian counteroffensives in the south,\" he said.\n\nOn the high seas, meanwhile, the first of the ships to leave Ukraine under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis has arrived in Turkey. The Turkey-flagged Polarnet docked at the port of Derince in the Gulf of Izmit after setting off from the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk on Friday laden with 12,000 tons of corn.\n\n\"This sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Ukraine won't abandon you,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. \"If Russia sticks to its obligations, the 'grain corridor' will keep maintaining global food security.\"\n\nYet Polarnet Captain Ahmet Yucel Alibeyler highlighted the risks faced by grain-carrying ships trying to cross the Black Sea.\n\n\"These were, of course, dangerous areas, corridors that had been cleared, demined,\" he said.\n\nOn the front lines of the war, the Kremlin reasserted Monday that Russia will keep up its military attacks on Ukraine until it achieves its goals.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said Monday that the Russian military shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the past 24 hours, killing five people and wounding 20 more.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south of the country overnight, local officials said, again hitting a strategic bridge in the southern city of Kherson.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol, a Russian-controlled city in the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region, said Ukrainian forces used U.S. HIMARS rocket launchers to shell several facilities where the Russian military was stationed. Mayor Ivan Fyodorov said on Telegram that some 100 Russian troops were killed. His claims could not be independently verified, and the Russian military did not immediately comment.\n\nKirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region, said Monday morning that Ukrainian shelling again damaged the Antonivskiy bridge over the Dnieper River.\n\nThe bridge, a key artery for Russian military supplies, has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling and plans to reopen it on Wednesday were shelved due to the latest attack, Stremousov said.\n\nRussian forces also kept shelling Nikopol, a city just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine's presidential office said. Nikopol's gas pipelines, plumbing and power lines are no longer functioning, and thousands of people are left without electricity.\n\nA total of 12 ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- ten outbound and two headed for Ukraine. Some 322,000 metric tons of agricultural products have left Ukrainian ports, the bulk of it corn but also sunflower oil and soya.\n\nFour ships that left Ukraine on Sunday are expected to anchor near Istanbul on Monday evening and be inspected on Tuesday to make sure they are carrying only food items south and no weapons into Ukraine.\n\nBut the grain deal remains far from plain sailing. The first cargo ship to leave Ukraine, the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, left Odessa on Aug. 1 heading for Lebanon with 26,000 metric tons of corn for chicken feed. But it has run into a business dispute and will no longer dock in Lebanon, the Tripoli port chief told The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nUkraine's embassy in Beirut tweeted Monday that the corn's final buyer in Lebanon refused to accept the cargo due to the delivery delay beyond a contractual limit and that the shipper was now looking for another buyer for the corn.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/WUAWAyDQFfl07Lz6IF_9_KTgCUg=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/XIO54C4J5IWJLBEMHJ62YKHRM4.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 24, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 36, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144250281", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "17:25:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T17:25:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T17:25:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/kremlin-accuses-kyiv-shelling-nuclear-plant-3599321", "title": "Kremlin Accuses Kyiv Of Shelling Nuclear Plant", "body": "The Kremlin accused Ukrainian forces on Monday of firing on Europe's largest nuclear power plant in occupied Ukraine and warned that the alleged attacks could have \"catastrophic consequences\".\n\nKyiv said Moscow was responsible and called for the area to be demilitarised, saying two employees had been wounded in recent attacks.\n\nFighting continued meanwhile along battle lines stretching across eastern Ukraine, and Russia continued its crackdown on dissent at home.\n\nEach side has blamed the other for the escalation in fighting around the facility in Zaporizhzhia, southeast Ukraine, which was captured by Russian forces early in their invasion, launched in late February.\n\nRecent fighting at the plant has prompted the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to warn of \"the very real risk of a nuclear disaster\".\n\nUkraine said that the plant should be cleared of Russian military and called for the establishment of an international security and energy team to oversee the sight.\n\n\"What needs to be done is to remove occupying forces from the station and to create a de-militarised zone on the territory of the station,\" said Petro Kotin, president of Ukraine's nuclear energy company, Energoatom.\n\n\"There should be a peacekeeping mission including experts from the IAEA and other security organisations,\" he added.\n\n\"Their presence and initially giving control to them and then to the Ukrainian side would have solved this problem\".\n\nKotin said that Russia had deployed some 500 Russian troops and 50 pieces of hardware including tanks at Zaporizhzhia, echoing earlier claims from Kyiv that Moscow was using the site for military cover.\n\nUkraine Prime Minister Denys Shmygal meanwhile accused Russia of \"nuclear terrorism,\" urging the world to \"unite now to prevent a catastrophe.\"\n\nThe Kremlin has captured swathes of Ukrainian territory since February, introducing Russian currency and by announcing plans to formally annex the areas by holding votes, including in the Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nThe head of its Moscow-installed administration Yevgeny Balitsky said on social media Monday he had signed a decree \"on the issue of organising a referendum on the reunification of the Zaporizhzhia region with the Russian Federation\".\n\nThe plans follow a similar move by Moscow in 2014 after it annexed the Crimean peninsula, a highly controversial vote that has not been recognised by most Western countries.\n\nAlthough attention was focused on the fallout from fighting at Zaporizhzhia, Russian forces continued shelling across the sprawling eastern frontline.\n\nAmong the attacks, Ukraine said that one woman had died and four more were injured in Russian bombardments on Kharkiv region in the north east.

power plant caught in Ukraine war", "body": "The Russian-held Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine, which is at the centre of international concern amid mutual accusations of shelling by Moscow and Kyiv, is Europe's biggest nuclear plant.\n\nRecent fighting around the plant has prompted the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to warn of the \"very real risk of a nuclear disaster\", while Kyiv has accused Moscow of \"nuclear terrorism\".\n\nFears of a possible incident have brought back haunting memories of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in then Soviet Ukraine, which left hundreds dead and spread radioactive contamination across Europe.\n\nHere are some key facts about the facility:\n\nHistory\n\nLocated near the city of Energodar on the Dnipro River, the plant has six of Ukraine's 15 reactors - enough to power four million homes.\n\nZaporizhzhia's reactors are Soviet-designed VVER-1000 pressurised water reactors, which are considered among the safest, with a total capacity of around 6,000 megawatts.\n\nThe reactors were all switched on between 1984 and 1995, according to the Ukrainian state agency Energoatom, which runs the plant.\n\nBefore the war, the plant was generating around a fifth of Ukraine's electricity.\n\nThe country, which has significant uranium reserves, is the seventh-largest producer of nuclear power in the world, according to the IAEA.\n\nIt began developing nuclear energy in the 1970s with the construction of Chernobyl, near the capital Kyiv, and has made major improvements in nuclear safety over the years since that cataclysmic event.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant is \"relatively modern\", Mark Wenman of Imperial College London told the Science Media Centre earlier, noting that its reactor components are housed inside a heavily reinforced containment building that can \"withstand extreme external events, both natural and man-made, such as an aircraft crash or explosions\".\n\nCapture\n\nThe power plant - located close to the Crimean peninsula which was annexed by Moscow in 2014 - was captured by Russian forces on 4 March following a battle in the early days of Moscow's invasion.\n\nThe fighting caused a fire at a training facility. Firefighters said they were prevented from reaching the blaze for hours.\n\nEnergoatom initially shut off two of the reactors - and more recently a third - but the plant has continued to be operated by Ukrainian technicians under Russian control.\n\nThe IAEA has repeatedly said it wants to organise an inspection of the plant.\n\nThis was initially opposed by Ukrainian authorities but officials have sounded less adamant about the prospect recently.\n\nRenewed fighting\n\nUkraine on 21 July accused Moscow of storing heavy weapons at the plant after Russia said Ukraine's troops had fired on the facility.\n\nEnergoatom said Russia had moved over two dozen pieces of military equipment and ammunition into the engine room of the first reactor.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Moscow was using it as a \"military base to fire at Ukrainians, knowing that they can't and won't shoot back\".\n\nOn 5 August, Ukraine accused Russian forces of carrying out strikes near a reactor. Russia said Ukraine was behind them.\n\nFollowing the attacks, Energoatom said it would have to shut down another reactor because of damage to a power cable.\n\nAnother reactor is being repaired, meaning only two reactors are now functioning.\n\nUkraine says there are around 500 Russian troops at the plant and has called for the establishment of a demilitarised zone.\n\nDespite the tensions, Energoatom has said it is still in contact with the plant and receives data on radiation monitoring.\n\nIt said today that there had been no change to radiation levels.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://img.rasset.ie/001c374a-1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 23, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 30, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7143968218", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "13:05:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T13:05:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T11:35:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6313725709915161, "url": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-accuses-ukraine-of-shelling-nuclear-power-station-again-41897186.html", "title": "Russia accuses Ukraine of shelling nuclear power station again", "body": "Russia has again accused Ukrainian forces of shelling Europe's largest nuclear power station.\n\nMoscow said the Zaporizhzhia plant had been shelled from Marganets on the opposite bank of the Dnipro River on Sunday.\n\nThe station, occupied for months by Russian forces, also came under fire late on Saturday and each side accused the other of the attack.\n\nRussian Defence Ministry spokesman Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov said in a statement on Monday that the Ukrainian attack a day earlier caused a power surge and smoke erupted at the power plant's switch facility, causing an emergency shutdown.\n\nFire teams extinguished the blaze and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No 5 and No 6 to 500 megawatt, Lt Gen Konashenkov said.\n\nRafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), recently warned that the way the plant was being run and the fighting going on around it posed grave health and environmental threats.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged western powers to force Kyiv to stop attacking the plant.\n\n\"Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous,\" Mr Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. \"It's fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for the entire Europe.\"\n\nBut Ukrainian military intelligence chief Andriy Yusov said his organisation had received credible information from several sources that the Russians had planted explosives at the Zaporizhzhia plant to head off an expected Ukrainian counter-offensive in the region.\n\n\"We have seen the Russian shelling of the Ukrainian nuclear power plant,\" Mr Yusov said. \"If it's not true, the Russians can make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA, if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nHe said the Russians used similar tactics at the Chernobyl nuclear plant when they occupied it.\n\n\"This is a strategy of terror and scorched earth used by the Russians ahead of an inevitable Ukrainian counter-offensive in the south,\" he said.\n\nThe Kremlin also reaffirmed that Russia will continue its military action in Ukraine until it achieves its goals, saying Kyiv has shown no interest in talks since March.\n\nAsked if plans for referendums in Russia-occupied areas in south-eastern Ukraine would effectively thwart any possible talks, Mr Peskov said those votes are being organised by local authorities, not Moscow.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south of the country overnight, according to Ukrainian and Russian-installed officials, including again hitting a strategic bridge in the southern city of Kherson.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol, a Russian-controlled city in the neighbouring Zaporizhzhia region, said Ukrainian forces shelled several facilities where Russian troops were stationed with US-provided HIMARS rocket launchers.\n\nIvan Fyodorov said on Telegram that 100 Russian troops were killed.

which had \"launched a new initiative in relation to a possible start of peace negotiations\".\n\nBut he explained that Ukraine cannot accept that \"its territory is taken by another country\", and that Russia \"does not seem ready to accept\" that areas it had taken \"will not be annexed by the Russian Federation or give way to new independent States\".\n\nMr. Guterres' comments followed a visit to Hiroshima over the weekend, where the Secretary-General marked the 77th anniversary of the world's first nuclear attack on 6 August 1945, destroying the city and killing 140,000 people.\n\nAmidst Russian threats of a nuclear attack, since it invaded Ukraine in February, fears of a third atomic bombing have grown.\n\nDuring Monday's news conference, the UN chief reiterated his warning over the use of nuclear weapons, saying that if used, the UN would probably be unable respond because \"we might all not be here anymore\".\n\nAgainst the backdrop that the world currently has 13,000 nuclear bombs while continuing to make huge investments into modernizing atomic arsenals, Mr. Guterres warned that after decades of nuclear disarmament efforts, we are \"moving backwards\".\n\n\"Stop it,\" he appealed, underscoring that the billions of dollars being leveraged into the arms race need to be used in \"fighting climate change, fighting poverty, [and] addressing the needs of the international community\".\n\n\"We all want that resolution to correspond to a peaceful environment,\" he said, calling for common sense and restraint to allow for an \"extremely important\" de-escalation.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "image":

showed sunbathers fleeing a nearby beach as huge clouds of smoke from the explosions rose over the horizon.\n\nThe defense ministry emphasized that the Saki base hadn't come under shelling. Ukrainian social networks were abuzz with speculation that Ukrainian long-range missiles could have been fired at it.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Ukrainian authorities.\n\nCrimea's head Sergei Aksyonov said ambulances and medical helicopters were scrambled to the Saki air base, but wouldn't say if there were any casualties. He added that authorities sealed off the area within a radius of five kilometers (about three miles) from the base.\n\nRussia annexed Crimea in 2014 and officials in Moscow have warned Ukraine that any attack on the peninsula would trigger a massive retaliation, including strikes on \"decision-making centers\" in Kyiv.\n\nThe Saki base allowed Russian warplanes stationed there to strike areas in Ukraine's south at short notice.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the office of Ukraine's president said that at least three Ukrainian civilians were killed and 23 others wounded by Russian shelling in 24 hours, including an attack not far from a Russian-occupied nuclear power plant, the office of Ukraine's president reported Tuesday.\n\nThe Russians fired over 120 rockets from Grad multiple rocket launchers at the southern town of Nikopol, which is across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Dnipropetrovsk Gov. Valentyn Reznichenko said. Several apartment buildings and industrial facilities were damaged, he said.\n\nUkraine and Russia accused each other in recent days of shelling the nuclear plant, which is the largest one in Europe, and increasing the risks of a nuclear accident.\n\nIn his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy invoked the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine, which at the time was a Soviet republic. He called for new sanctions against Russia \"for creating the threat\" of another nuclear disaster.\n\n\"We are actively informing the world about Russian nuclear blackmail -- about the shelling and mining of the Zaporizhzhia NPP facilities,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Russia will not pay attention to words and concerns ... The Chernobyl disaster is an explosion in one reactor; the Zaporizhzhia NPP is six power units.\"\n\nThe Kremlin claimed Monday that Ukraine's military was attacking the plant and urged Western powers to force Kyiv to stop the activity.\n\nA Russian-installed official in the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia region said an air defense system at the plant would be reinforced in the aftermath of last week's shelling. Evgeny Balitsky, the head of the Kremlin-backed administration, told Russian state TV Tuesday that power lines and damaged blocks of the plant were restored.\n\n\"The plant is operating normally, but, of course, with an increased degree of security,\" Balitsky said.\n\nA Ukrainian counteroffensive and Russian defensive actions in occupied areas have increasingly drawn firepower to southern Ukraine.\n\nDrones are playing a crucial role in Ukraine's military operations in the southern Mykolaiv region where Russian shelling has been escalating in recent weeks.\n\nThe leader of a Ukrainian reconnaissance team named \"Fireflies\" -- who goes by the nom de guerre \"Baton\" -- said his unit is using drones to monitor and combat any Russian attempt to seize more territory in the region.\n\n\"This is a war of artillery and drones,\" Baton told reporters, as he observed smoke rising after an attack on a Russian position a few kilometers away on a monitor with the feed sent from the vehicle.\n\nDrones are the only \"eyes,\" Baton said.\n\nAfter failing to capture Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, early in the war, the Russian military focused its strength on trying to seize all of the country's eastern Donbas region. Pro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the region for eight years and control some territory as self-proclaimed republics.\n\nThe British Defense Ministry said Tuesday that Russian forces had made the most progress in the past month in moving toward the town of Bakhmut -- an advance limited to about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles).\n\n\"In other Donbas sectors where Russia was attempting to break through, its forces have not gained more than 3 km during this 30-day period; almost certainly significantly less than planned,\" the U.K. ministry said.\n\nHowever, the ministry cautioned that despite the attention required in southern Ukraine, Russia had maintained attacks on Ukrainian positions in the east.\n\nThe governor of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk province, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said the Russians were trying to press their offensive in several areas. Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, came under Russian shelling four times over the past 24 hours, and some city infrastructure was damaged.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri": "accesswdun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Access WDUN"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://binaryapi.ap.org/68507ed4aa474defbb29acb45ef31e26/preview.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 25, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 36, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144311690", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "18:34:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T18:34:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T18:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "url": "http://theindianawaaz.com/un-chief-calls-for-international-inspectors-to-be-given-access-to-ukrainian-nuclear-plant/", "title": "UN Chief calls for international inspectors to be given access to Ukrainian nuclear plant", "body": "United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres today asserted that the international inspectors to be given access to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant after Ukraine and Russia traded accusations over the shelling of Europe's largest atomic plant.

The opposite banks of the Dnieper, one of Europe's longest and biggest rivers, are controlled by Ukrainian forces. At the Kakhovka Reservoir, between 3 miles and 5 miles of water separate the two warring sides.\n\nSince Friday, parts of the plant were damaged after coming under attack. By Monday, Russian authorities said the power facility was operating normally, but outside inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency have not yet been allowed to visit the site as both sides trade accusations.\n\n\"Any attack on nuclear power plants is a suicidal thing,\" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters in Tokyo. \"I hope that these attacks will end.\" He said IAEA must be given access to the plant.\n\nRussia accuses Ukrainian troops of firing on the plant from across the river. At least two high-voltage power lines, radiation sensors and a water pipeline were damaged, prompting an emergency shutdown of a power unit after a fire broke out.

But combat is growing more fierce in southern Ukraine as both sides build up their forces and fight for control over Black Sea ports, cities and territories.\n\nOn Monday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, accused Ukraine of shelling the nuclear plant.\n\n\"It's fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for the entire Europe,\" he told reporters, as reported by Tass, a Russian state news agency.\n\nUkraine's state nuclear agency, Enerhoatom, said parts of the plant were \"seriously damaged\" after a station containing oxygen and nitrogen and an \"auxiliary building\" were struck by shelling. It accused Russia of firing on the plant.\n\nEnerhoatom's personnel continue to run the plant, though Russian soldiers and staff from Rosatom, Russia's state nuclear corporation, are also on site.\n\nEnerhoatom said the plant is \"operating at risk of violating the norms of radiation and fire protection\" and that the facility must be declared a demilitarized zone.\n\nFighting continues to rage in the main theater of the war, the eastern Donbas region.\n\nFor days, Russian artillery and airplanes have been pounding Ukrainian forces in the Donetsk region even harder than before. Slow Russian advances continued over the weekend against this heavily fortified section of the front line. So far, Russia has seized about 20% of Ukraine's territory, according to military maps.\n\nOver the past eight years, Ukraine's army built a series of bunkers, trenches and other fortifications in Donbas as part of a \"frozen war\" between Kyiv and Russia-backed separatists of the self-declared \"people's republics\" of Donetsk and Luhansk. The heavy line of fortifications and fierce Ukrainian resistance has slowed progress by Russian and Ukrainian separatist forces.\n\nAs the war rages in Ukraine, a parallel diplomatic contest is playing out between Russia and the West to win sway over world leaders.\n\nIn recent weeks, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has been traveling hard in Africa, Asia and the Middle East to rally developing nations to Russia's side.\n\nSince Russia's banishment from the U.S.-dominated financial system following the Ukraine invasion, the Kremlin has cranked up its efforts to create rival financial and trade systems. Russia is also reeling from massive Western sanctions.\n\nMany analysts believe the war is strengthening the so-called BRICS association, which is made up of major emerging and developing counties. BRICS is an acronym for the group's major members: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. These countries - and others such as Pakistan - have not condemned Russia for its invasion.\n\nIn launching the Ukraine war, Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to break U.S. dominance over world affairs - what is known as a \"unipolar\" system - and foster a \"multi-polar\" world order where the U.S. has to share power with other superpowers. Other non-Western major countries also are pushing to obtain more influence in world affairs, complicating the West's uncompromising stance on Russia.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in South Africa as part of a 10-day trip to Asia and Africa.

Your support matters!\n\nThe Kremlin accused Ukrainian forces on Monday of firing on Europe's largest nuclear power plant in occupied Ukraine and warned that the alleged attacks could have \"catastrophic consequences\".\n\nKyiv said Moscow was responsible and called for the area to be demilitarised, saying two employees had been wounded in recent attacks.\n\nFighting continued meanwhile along battle lines stretching across eastern Ukraine, and Russia continued its crackdown on dissent at home.\n\nEach side has blamed the other for the escalation in fighting around the facility in Zaporizhzhia, southeast Ukraine, which was captured by Russian forces early in their invasion, launched in late February.\n\nRecent fighting at the plant has prompted the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to warn of \"the very real risk of a nuclear disaster\".\n\nUkraine said that the plant should be cleared of Russian military and called for the establishment of an international security and energy team to oversee the sight.\n\n\"What needs to be done is to remove occupying forces from the station and to create a de-militarised zone on the territory of the station,\" said Petro Kotin, president of Ukraine's nuclear energy company, Energoatom.\n\n\"There should be a peacekeeping mission including experts from the IAEA and other security organisations,\" he added.\n\n\"Their presence and initially giving control to them and then to the Ukrainian side would have solved this problem\".\n\nKotin said that Russia had deployed some 500 Russian troops and 50 pieces of hardware including tanks at Zaporizhzhia, echoing earlier claims from Kyiv that Moscow was using the site for military cover.\n\nUkraine Prime Minister Denys Shmygal meanwhile accused Russia of \"nuclear terrorism,\" urging the world to \"unite now to prevent a catastrophe.\"\n\nThe Kremlin has captured swathes of Ukrainian territory since February, introducing Russian currency and by announcing plans to formally annex the areas by holding votes, including in the Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nThe head of its Moscow-installed administration Yevgeny Balitsky said on social media Monday he had signed a decree \"on the issue of organising a referendum on the reunification of the Zaporizhzhia region with the Russian Federation\".\n\nThe plans follow a similar move by Moscow in 2014 after it annexed the Crimean peninsula, a highly controversial vote that has not been recognised by most Western countries.\n\nAlthough attention was focused on the fallout from fighting at Zaporizhzhia, Russian forces continued shelling across the sprawling eastern frontline.\n\nAmong the attacks, Ukraine said that one woman had died and four more were injured in Russian bombardments on Kharkiv region in the north east. It has been under persistent Russian shelling for weeks.\n\nUkrainian forces in turn said they had bombed a strategic bridge over the Dnipro river overnight in the Russian-held city of Kherson in the south.\n\nThe authorities in Moscow pursued their crackdown on opposition to the war, handing down a new fine to journalist Marina Ovsyannikova.\n\nOvsyannikova shot to prominence in March for interrupting a live broadcast to denounce Russia's military intervention in Ukraine.\n\nOn Monday, her lawyer did not rule out the possibility of her facing another criminal probe.\n\nThere was progress on one rare area of compromise between Russian and Ukraine Monday, after the first boat to leave Ukrainian ports under a recent deal Ankara and UN reached its destination in Turkey.\n\nWhile Kyiv welcomed the news, officials also said there was a delay in the first delivery to leave Ukrainian ports because the buyer had refused delivery, citing a five-month delay in shipment.\n\nInfrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on social media that a cargo ship carrying grain had departed for the first time from the Black Sea port of Pivdennyi.", "source": {"uri": "legit.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Legit.ng - Nigeria news."}, "authors": [], "image": "https://netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1faf9def7c0a18c0.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 16, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 27, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144807110", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-09", "time": "06:41:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-09T06:41:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-09T06:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "url": "https://www.euronews.com/2022/08/09/ukraine-war-what-you-need-to-know-this-tuesday", "title": "Ukraine war: What you need to know this Tuesday", "body": "Ukraine said on Tuesday its military has captured ground around Kharkiv in the northeast and is resisting a heavy Russian assault in frontline towns near the eastern city of Donetsk.\n\nUkrainian officials said Russian troops were launching waves of attacks as they try to seize control of the industrialised Donbas region.\n\n\"The situation in the region is tense - shelling is constant throughout the front line ...

February, a senior Pentagon official estimated.\n\n\"The Russians have probably taken 70 or 80,000 casualties in less than six months,\" Under Secretary of Defense Colin Kahl said on Monday.\n\nHe added that Moscow's armed forces have also lost \"3,000 to 4,000\" armoured vehicles, and could be running low on precision-guided missiles, including air and sea-launched cruise missiles.\n\nKahl admitted that Ukraine had also suffered significant troop losses, however stopped short of giving an exact figure.\n\n\"Both sides are taking casualties,\" he said. \"The war is the most intense conventional conflict in Europe since the Second World War.\"\n\n\"But the Ukrainians have a lot of advantages, not the least of which is their will to fight,\" Kahl added.\n\nKahl said Russia was running low on missiles after firing a large number on Ukraine targets since launching the invasion in February.\n\nHe pointed to a slowdown in Russia's use of longer-range and precision-guided missiles as an indicator that supplies were being depleted.\n\nRussia's losses are \"pretty remarkable considering the Russians have achieved none of Vladimir Putin's objectives at the beginning of the war,\" he told reporters.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have again accused one another of bombing Europe's biggest nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine.\n\nMoscow claimed on Monday that Ukrainian shelling had caused a power surge and fire at Zaporizhzhia, forcing staff to reduce activity in two nuclear reactors.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine blamed Russia for basing troops and military equipment at the site.\n\nZaporizhzhia, which was captured by Russian forces early on in the war, is an increasing cause of concern for international observers, with both the UN and International Atomic Energy Agency issuing stark warnings about the risks of fighting near the plant.\n\n\"Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told AP. \"It's fraught with catastrophic consequences ... for the entire Europe.\"\n\nUkraine's military spokesman, Andriy Yusov, responded that Russian forces have laid explosives at Zaporizhzhia to stop a potential Ukrainian counteroffensive in the region.\n\nIn the past, Ukrainian officials have said Russia is using Zaporizhzhia to stage attacks on its forces, turning the Ukrainian workers at the plant into \"human shields.\"\n\nThe head of Ukraine's state nuclear power company Energoatom called on Monday for Zaporizhzhia to be made a military-free zone, warning of a Chornobyl-style nuclear disaster.\n\nRussia announced on Monday it will no longer allow the US to inspect its nuclear arsenal as part of an international arms control treaty.\n\nMoscow said the move, which it described as temporary, was in response to Western sanctions that have hamstrung its ability to monitor US facilities.\n\nThis is the first time Russia has halted US inspections under the Obama-era New START nuclear arms control treaty, coming amid heightened tensions between the old Cold War foes.\n\nAnnouncing the freeze, the Russian Foreign Ministry said the sanctions imposed on Russian flights, visa restrictions and other obstacles imposed by the West have made it increasingly impossible for Russian military experts to visit US nuclear weapons sites.\n\nThis gave Washington \"unilateral advantages,\" it claimed.\n\nThe Biden administration did not immediately comment on the development.\n\nAnkit Panda, an expert on nuclear policy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Russia was attempting to \"pressure\" the US over Western sanctions due to its Ukraine invasion.\n\n\"They basically are using New START inspections -- something the US cares about -- to force Washington's hands,\" Panda said.\n\nThe New START treaty, signed in 2010 by then US President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, limits the number of nuclear warheads each country can deploy to 1,550, alongside 700 missiles and bombers.\n\nOn-site inspections are part of the deal to ensure it is being honoured.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com",

"body": "Kyiv said Moscow was responsible and called for the area to be demilitarised, adding that two employees had been wounded in recent attacks.\n\nFighting continued meanwhile along battle lines stretching across eastern Ukraine, and Russia continued its crackdown on dissent at home.\n\nEach side has blamed the other for the escalation in fighting around the nuclear facility in Zaporizhzhia in southeastern Ukraine, which was captured by Russian forces soon after their late February invasion.\n\nRecent fighting at the plant has prompted the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to warn of \"the very real risk of a nuclear disaster\".\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky also raised the spectre of a catastrophe in his nightly address Monday, invoking the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.\n\n\"The world should not forget about Chernobyl and should remember that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is the biggest in Europe,\" Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine said the plant should be cleared of Russian forces and called for the establishment of an international security and energy team to oversee the site.\n\n\"What needs to be done is to remove occupying forces from the station and to create a de-militarised zone on the territory of the station,\" said Petro Kotin, president of Ukraine's nuclear energy company, Energoatom.\n\n\"There should be a peacekeeping mission including experts from the IAEA and other security organisations,\" he added.\n\n\"Their presence and initially giving control to them and then to the Ukrainian side would have solved this problem\".\n\nKotin said Russia had deployed some 500 Russian troops and 50 pieces of hardware including tanks at Zaporizhzhia, echoing earlier claims from Kyiv that Moscow was using the site for military cover.\n\nUkraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmygal meanwhile accused Russia of \"nuclear terrorism,\" urging the world to \"unite now to prevent a catastrophe\".\n\nThe Kremlin has captured swathes of Ukrainian territory since February, introducing Russian currency and announcing plans to formally annex the areas by holding votes, including in the Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nThe head of its Moscow-installed administration Yevgeny Balitsky said on social media Monday he had signed a decree \"on the issue of organising a referendum on the reunification of the Zaporizhzhia region with the Russian Federation\".\n\nThe plans follow a similar move by Moscow in 2014 after it annexed the Crimean peninsula, a highly controversial vote that has not been recognised by most Western countries.\n\nAs Russian forces continued shelling across the sprawling eastern frontline, one woman was killed and four more were injured in the Kharkiv region in the northeast, Kyiv said.\n\nUkrainian forces in turn said they had bombed a strategic bridge over the Dnipro river overnight in the Russian-held city of Kherson in the south.\n\nMore than five months of fighting has taken a heavy toll on Russian forces, with up to 80,000 of Moscow's troops killed or wounded and 3-4,000 armoured vehicles lost, a senior Pentagon official said Monday.\n\nThere were also fresh pledges of Western aid.\n\nThe Pentagon announced military aid for Ukraine worth $1 billion including additional precision ammunition for the Himars system that has helped Kyiv's forces attack Russian troops far behind the front lines.\n\nThe World Bank said it was mobilising another $4.5 billion in US-provided financial support to help Kyiv pay for services and pensions, key to easing the invasion's economic impacts.\n\nBut the United Nations said Monday that more than 17 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance due to the Ukraine conflict, and increased an appeal for funds to respond to the crisis from $2.25 billion to $4.3 billion.\n\nThe authorities in Moscow pursued their crackdown on opposition to the war, handing down a new fine to journalist Marina Ovsyannikova.\n\nOvsyannikova shot to prominence in March for interrupting a live broadcast to denounce Russia's military intervention in Ukraine.\n\nOn Monday, her lawyer did not rule out the possibility of her facing another criminal probe.\n\nA Ukrainian court meanwhile jailed a Russian tank crewman for 10 years for firing on a multi-storied apartment block in the northern city of Chernigiv early on in the invasion, according to authorities in Kyiv.\n\nSecurity officials also said they arrested Russian agents who were planning to assassinate the defence minister and the military intelligence chief.\n\nThere was progress on one rare area of compromise between Russian and Ukraine Monday, after the first cargo ship that left a Ukrainian port reached its final destination under a recent deal brokered by Ankara and the UN docked in Turkey.\n\nWhile Kyiv welcomed the news, officials also said there was a delay in the first delivery to leave Ukrainian ports

whose safety is in doubt after coming under attack last week.\n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency inspectors have said there's a \"very real risk of a nuclear disaster\" at Europe's biggest atomic power plant amid fighting in the area. The Zaporizhzhia site, with six reactors worth tens of billions of dollars, has been occupied by Russian forces since March.\n\nThe Kremlin's envoy to the IAEA has invited an international mission to Zaporizhzhia to conduct \"activities within the framework of the implementation of safeguards, as well as monitoring the state of nuclear safety and security,\" according to a note circulated among diplomats in Vienna.\n\nThe Russian move is just one of a series of steps required for the IAEA to send inspectors. Speaking at the United Nations last week, IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said he needs permission from Ukraine's government, as well as security guarantees and a safe passage through the war zone.\n\n\"Going there is a very complex thing because it requires the cooperation and understanding of a number of actors,\" Grossi said. \"It's a Ukrainian facility, so it requires Ukraine to agree. At the same time, the plant is occupied by Russia and I have to talk to everybody.\"\n\nUkraine's nuclear utility, Energoatom, appeared to back the suggestion for an international mission to Zaporizhzhia on Monday.\n\n\"We call on our partners to make a demilitarized zone at the station,\" Energoatom President Petro Kotin said in a broadcast interview. \"There should be a mission of peacekeepers and experts from the IAEA and other organizations.\"\n\nUkraine believes there to be about 500 Russian soldiers in and around the Zaporizhzhia site, which continues to be operated by Ukrainian technicians. The shelling damaged cables at a nearby coal-power plant, which provides electricity for cooling and circulation at the nuclear site, according to regulators.\n\nWithout constant electricity flows to moderate atomic fission, nuclear reactors run the risk of melting down.

Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Monday that the Ukrainian attack a day earlier at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant caused a power surge and smoke erupted at its switch facility, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished the fire, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged Western powers to force Kyiv to stop attacking the plant.\n\n\"Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous,\" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. \"It's fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for the entire Europe.\"\n\nBut Yusov, Ukraine's military intelligence chief, said Monday: \"We have seen the Russian shelling of the Ukrainian nuclear power plant.\"\n\nHe added that, \"If it's not so, if it doesn't conform to reality, the Russians can make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA, if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nYusov said the Russians used similar tactics at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant when they had occupied it early in the war.\n\n\"This is a strategy of terror and scorched earth used by the Russians ahead of an inevitable Ukrainian counteroffensives in the south,\" he said.\n\nOn the high seas, meanwhile, the first of the ships to leave Ukraine under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis has arrived in Turkey. The Turkey-flagged Polarnet docked at the port of Derince in the Gulf of Izmit after setting off from the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk on Friday laden with 12,000 tons of corn.\n\n\"This sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Ukraine won't abandon you,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. \"If Russia sticks to its obligations, the 'grain corridor' will keep maintaining global food security.\"\n\nYet Polarnet Captain Ahmet Yucel Alibeyler highlighted the risks faced by grain-carrying ships trying to cross the Black Sea.\n\n\"These were, of course, dangerous areas, corridors that had been cleared, demined,\" he said.\n\nOn the front lines of the war, the Kremlin reasserted Monday that Russia will keep up its military attacks on Ukraine until it achieves its goals.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said Monday that the Russian military shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the past 24 hours, killing five people and wounding 20 more.\n\nUkrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south of the country overnight, local officials said, again hitting a strategic bridge in the southern city of Kherson.\n\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol, a Russian-controlled city in the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region, said Ukrainian forces used U.S. HIMARS rocket launchers to shell several facilities where the Russian military was stationed. Mayor Ivan Fyodorov said on Telegram that some 100 Russian troops were killed. His claims could not be independently verified, and the Russian military did not immediately comment.\n\nKirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region, said Monday morning that Ukrainian shelling again damaged the Antonivskiy bridge over the Dnieper River.\n\nThe bridge, a key artery for Russian military supplies, has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling and plans to reopen it on Wednesday were shelved due to the latest attack, Stremousov said.\n\nRussian forces also kept shelling Nikopol, a city just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine's presidential office said. Nikopol's gas pipelines, plumbing and power lines are no longer functioning, and thousands of people are left without electricity.\n\nA total of 12 ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- ten outbound and two headed for Ukraine. Some 322,000 metric tons of agricultural products have left Ukrainian ports, the bulk of it corn but also sunflower oil and soya.\n\nFour ships that left Ukraine on Sunday are expected to anchor near Istanbul on Monday evening and be inspected on Tuesday to make sure they are carrying only food items south and no weapons into Ukraine.\n\nBut the grain deal remains far from plain sailing. The first cargo ship to leave Ukraine, the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, left Odessa on Aug. 1 heading for Lebanon with 26,000 metric tons of corn for chicken feed. But it has run into a business dispute and will no longer dock in Lebanon, the Tripoli port chief told The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nUkraine's embassy in Beirut tweeted Monday that the corn's final buyer in Lebanon refused to accept the cargo due to the delivery delay beyond a contractual limit and that the shipper was now looking for another buyer for the corn.\n\nKareem Chehayeb in Beirut, Mehmet Guzel in Derince, Turkey, and Andrew Wilks in Istanbul contributed.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Firefighters said they were prevented from reaching the blaze for hours.\n\nEnergoatom initially shut off two of the reactors -- and more recently a third -- but the plant has continued to be operated by Ukrainian technicians under Russian control.\n\nThe IAEA has repeatedly said it wants to organise an inspection of the plant.\n\nThis was initially opposed by Ukrainian authorities but officials have sounded less adamant about the prospect recently.\n\nUkraine on July 21 accused Moscow of storing heavy weapons at the plant after Russia said Ukraine's troops had fired on the facility.\n\nEnergoatom said Russia had moved over two dozen pieces of military equipment and ammunition into the engine room of the first reactor.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Moscow was using it as a \"military base to fire at Ukrainians, knowing that they can't and won't shoot back\".\n\nOn August 5, Ukraine accused Russian forces of carrying out strikes near a reactor. Russia said Ukraine was behind them.\n\nFollowing the attacks, Energoatom said it would have to shut down another reactor because of damage to a power cable.\n\nAnother reactor is being repaired, meaning only two reactors are now functioning.\n\nUkraine says there are around 500 Russian troops at the plant and has called for the establishment of a demilitarised zone.\n\nDespite the tensions, Energoatom has said it is still in contact with the plant and receives data on radiation monitoring.\n\nIt said on Monday that there had been no change to radiation levels.", "source": {"uri":

company Energoatom, called for a team of peacekeepers to be deployed at the Zaporizhzhia site which is still run by Ukrainian technicians.\n\n\"The decision that we demand from the world community and

areas of Ukraine's south.\n\nHe called for a UN-led mission to the plant by the end of this month.\n\n\"We really need it urgently, as soon as possible,\" Mr Tsymbaliuk said.\n\nThe RIA Novosti news agency quoted Moscow's ambassador to the IAEA who said Russia was ready to facilitate a visit to the reactor complex.\n\nThe world's worst civil nuclear disaster occurred in 1986 when a reactor at the Chornobyl complex in northwest Ukraine exploded.\n\nMr Guterres said IAEA personnel needed access to the Zaporizhzhia to \"create conditions for stabilisation\".\n\nUkraine said it is planning to conduct a major counter-offensive in the Russian-occupied south, apparently focused on the city of Kherson, west of Zaporizhzhia, and that it has already retaken dozens of villages.\n\nElsewhere, a deal to unblock Ukraine's food exports and ease global shortages gathered pace as two grain ships sailed out of Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Monday, raising the total to 12 since the first vessel left a week ago.\n\nThe two latest outgoing ships were carrying almost 59,000 tonnes of corn and soybeans and were bound for Italy and southeastern Turkey.\n\nThe four that left on Sunday bore almost 170,000 tonnes of corn and other food.\n\nThe July 22 grain export pact brokered by Turkey and the United Nations represents a rare diplomatic triumph as fighting churns on in Ukraine and aims to help ease soaring global food prices arising from the war.\n\nBefore the invasion, Russia and Ukraine accounted for nearly a third of global wheat exports.\n\nThe disruption since then has raised the spectre of famine in parts of the world.\n\nUkraine said it hopes to export 20 million tonnes of grain in silos and 40 million from its new harvest to help rebuild its wrecked economy.\n\nRussian

the site was struck without damage to its reactors. The area, including the city of Kherson, is now the target of a Ukrainian counter-offensive. Ukraine appealed for the area around the complex to be demilitarised and for the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, to be let in. Russia said it too favoured an IAEA visit, which it accused Ukraine of blocking.\n\nBoth sides blamed the other for weekend attacks around the complex, which is still being run by Ukrainian technicians. Ukraine said three radiation sensors were damaged and two workers injured by shrapnel. Petro Kotin, head of Ukraine's state nuclear power company Energoatom, said 500 Russian soldiers and 50 pieces of heavy machinery, including tanks, trucks and armoured infantry vehicles were at the site.\n\nHe called for peacekeepers to run the plant, and warned of the risk of shells hitting the plant's six containers of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel. Russia's defence ministry said Ukrainian attacks had damaged power lines servicing the plant and forced it to reduce output by two of its six reactors to \"prevent disruption\".\n\nReuters could not independently verify either side's account. In an evening video shared online, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new Western sanctions on Russia's nuclear industry \"for creating the threat of a nuclear disaster.\"\n\nDr Mark Wenman, a nuclear expert at Imperial College London, played down the risk of a major incident, saying the Zaporizhzhia reactors were relatively robust and the spent fuel well protected.

Overall, the United States has contributed more than $18 billion to Ukraine this year.\n\nRussia says it is waging a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine to rid it of nationalists and protect Russian-speaking communities. Ukraine and the West describe Russia's actions as an unprovoked war of aggression.

A shattered window. A punctured roof.\n\nThe fins of a missile casing planted in the ground, amid a stand of birch trees, just a few hundred metres from the closest of the six reactors that make up the Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.\n\nControlled by invading Russian forces since March, the nuclear facility in Enerhodar -- a name that means \"the gift of energy\" -- is the largest in Europe and one of the biggest sources of global fear in this, the sixth month of the war in Ukraine.\n\nFrom the Ukrainians come accusations that the occupying Russians have mined the plant, moved in weapons and military hardware and are carrying out sabotage attacks as part of a plot to cut Ukrainians off from their largest source of energy.\n\nThe concert of actions amount to \"nuclear terrorism,\" Ukrainian Human Rights Commissioner Dmytro Lubinets said Monday in calling for a United Nations security mission to be sent to Zaporizhzhia.\n\n\"The destructive consequences of nuclear terrorism and the spread of radioactivity do not 'respect' state borders and radioactive emissions spread uncontrollably, the consequences of radioactive pollution remains for decades,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe urgent call cited the words of a Russian general addressing his troops: \"There will be either Russian land or a scorched desert. ... We are ready for the consequences of this step.\"\n\nThe quote, which appeared online and quickly vanished, is disputed.\n\nThe gravity of the consequences in the event of a misfire, a wayward strike, a rambunctious Rambo from either side, are not.\n\nThe Russians started this -- both the overall conflict back in February and a novel, sinister sort of nuclear gambit -- when they first seized the Zaporizhzhia plant, with guns blazing, back in early March.\n\nSince then, the Ukrainian staff of the nuclear facility have continued working under the watch of the Russian military and, reportedly, experts at Russia's nuclear agency, Rosatom.\n\nMoscow says its forces have been contending with Ukrainian drone strikes on and around the nuclear plant and, this weekend, a volley of rocket and artillery strikes at the facility.\n\nThe Ukrainians deny responsibility for the strikes, which are said to have caused a fire at a water pipeline, damage to nearby buildings and come dangerously close to an open-air yard containing 174 casks of spent nuclear fuel.\n\nMoscow's hand-picked administrator for the Zaporizhzhia region, Evgeny Balitsky, published the above-mentioned video of the damage Sunday.\n\nOn Monday, he was busy with another matter -- announcing a future referendum that would make Zaporizhzhia, in Ukraine's southeast, part of Vladimir Putin's Russia.\n\nThere is no date yet for the vote, but it points to the larger game that Russia has put into play in Ukraine.\n\nYes, Moscow has been cast in the role of the nuclear madman right from the beginning of this horrible show.\n\nPutin's performance began when he placed Russia's nuclear deterrent forces on high alert due to nothing more than the assertion by British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss that Putin's aggression could lead to a larger conflict with NATO countries if he wasn't stopped in Ukraine.\n\nBut Russia displayed its utter recklessness or absolute ignorance when an invasion force churned up and dug into the poisoned earth of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone -- located in a toxic swath of land near the northern Ukrainian border with Belarus -- either unaware or unconcerned about the real risks of radiation poisoning from the 1986 nuclear disaster before they were driven out by defensive Ukrainian troops in March.\n\nIt was around the same time that the Russians took control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after an armed attack that resulted in a fire at a nearby training facility.\n\n\"By the grace of God, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night,\" the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the United Nations Security Council the following day.\n\nNuclear experts later came to the rescue, weighing down the lofty rhetoric with facts and explaining that the risks of another Hiroshima, Chernobyl or Fukushima-like disaster were low.\n\nBut Moscow persists in using a gut-level fear of nuclear disaster to its military advantage.\n\nLast week, the New York Times reported that Russian forces had parked Grad multiple rocket launchers between the Zaporizhzhia reactor buildings and armoured personnel carriers and military trucks in the turbine room of one of the reactors, information it attributed to a former mayor of Enerhodar.\n\nIf such claims are accurate, it would mean that Moscow is treating Zaporizhzhia's six red-roofed reactors as something akin to human shields, allowing it to fire at will without the fear of provoking a serious counter-barrage.\n\n\"It's a potentially catastrophic radiation shield which NATO and the West probably won't do anything against,\" said Lt.-Col. (Ret'd) Steve Nash, a former commander of the Canadian Joint Incident Response Unit, a military special operations military unit that responds to nuclear, chemical and biological incident.\n\n\"The chance of a big event is not great, but the catastrophic nature of any event there could be. It could be a new Chernobyl, which affected the world for a couple of decades.\"\n\nIt was Putin's main NATO adversaries who have given him the courage to think that such a strategy might work.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden laid it out in March. He did not say the word \"nuclear,\" but he didn't have to.\n\n\"Direct confrontation between NATO and Russia is World War Three,\" he said, \"something we must strive to prevent.\"\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine, the West pulled its military training teams, delayed heavy weapon deliveries, refused Kyiv's pleas for a no-fly zone and rejected fighter jet donation schemes. All of this to avoid the Kremlin conclusion that Russia faced an existential threat, the doctrinal red line for Putin to deploy actual nuclear weapons.\n\nIn its extreme reticence to avoid an escalation and a hypothetical nuclear spillover, the West tacitly set the table for the odious strategy now playing out in Zaporizhzhia.\n\nNow the nuclear plant is a Russian beachhead on the banks of the Dnipro River -- the crown of the contested southern lands that have been seized by Russia, but which Ukraine intends to retake.\n\nFrom the Zaporizhzhia plant's control centre, Putin will be able to cut energy supplies to recalcitrant or rebellious parts of Ukraine that don't bend to Russian rule.\n\nIn Europe, they are already fretting about the literal cold shoulder treatment from Russia, which is restricting oil and gas flows in advance of what will be brutal winter.\n\nBut Nash noted that Russians have a long history of taking the brutal cold and turning it to the country's military advantage.\n\nStalin's Red Army broke the back of Nazi Germany in the Second World War, he said.\n\n\"Read even Tolstoy's 'War and Peace', where Napoleon's armies captured Moscow. The Russians were fine in winter. They ate turnips and potatoes and they just waited to walk out and destroy the French army, Napoleon's army -- and they did.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://images.thestar.com/1m2FfXgHPr1_Q_hyt-TXDbM3mfY=/1200x800/smart/filters:cb(1660000811661):format(webp)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/analysis/2022/08/08/nuclear-terrorism-how-a-sinister-russian-gambit-is-playing-out-from-a-ukrainian-nuclear-power-plant/_main.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 14, "stanza_neu": 34, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 49, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7145165633", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-09", "time": "12:03:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-09T12:03:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-09T11:45:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6039215922355652, "url": "https://www.econotimes.com/Russia-Ukraine-conflict-Kyiv-calls-for-area-around-Zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-to-be-demilitarized-zone-1639010", "title": "Russia-Ukraine conflict: Kyiv calls for area around Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to be demilitarized zone - EconoTimes", "body": "Russia and Ukraine have been trading accusations at each other for the recent shelling of a nuclear power plant in the occupied region of Zaporizhzhia.

The facility, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, is under the occupation of Russian forces since March. Mikhail Ulyanov, the permanent representative of the Russian Federation to international organizations in Vienna, stated that Moscow is ready to organise the visit but the agency also needs to take into consideration the \"criminal actions\" of Kyiv carried out around the plant.\n\nWe have already issued a circular stating our readiness to assist the IAEA leadership in organizing such a visit to the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Russia is also interested in the agency having information about the criminal actions of Kyiv and the campaign of disinformation that the Zelenskyy's regime has been carrying out,\" Ulyanov told RIA Novosti. His remarks came as the IAEA has often expressed concerns over the security of the plant and is willing to send an expert mission to take stock of the facility.\n\nSince Russia launched a full-fledged war on Ukraine in late February, the situation at the plant has been a source of concern for the IAEA. The Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant is under Russian control but, is currently run by Ukrainians as the conflict between the two countries continues to escalate for more than 160 days now. Earlier on August 6, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi expressed his \"grave concern\" over shelling at the nuclear power plant, which is located in southern Ukraine. He also cautioned the attack highlights the possibility of a nuclear tragedy which may endanger the environment and human health in Ukraine and beyond.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian administration has also accused Ukraine of sheeling at Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, and also warned of \"catastrophic consequences\" of attacks. Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov stated Russia hopes that countries that have an absolute influence on Kyiv will use it to prevent such shelling in the future. Notably, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was attacked by Russian forces earlier on March 4, 2022.

He said it \"underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster that could threaten public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond\". He added: \"The IAEA has received information about this serious situation - the latest in a long line of increasingly alarming reports from all sides.\"\n\nAccording to Ukrainian sources, there has been no damage to the reactors themselves and no radiological release. However, there is damage elsewhere on the site. \"Military action jeopardising the safety and security of the Zaporizhzhia NPP is completely unacceptable and must be avoided at all costs,\" Grossi said. \"Any military firepower directed at or from the facility would amount to playing with fire, with potentially catastrophic consequences. I strongly and urgently appeal to all parties to exercise the utmost restraint in the vicinity of this important nuclear facility, with its six reactors. And I condemn any violent acts carried out at or near the Zaporizhzhia NPP or against its staff.\"\n\nHe stressed: \"This must stop and stop now. In order to help prevent the situation from spiralling even more out of control, the IAEA's presence to provide technical support for nuclear safety and security is of paramount importance.\" He added: \"And for the last four months now, I have been ready to lead a mission of IAEA safety, security and safeguards experts to the country's biggest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia.\" This would enable the delivery of nuclear safety and security equipment that is urgently needed and would allow IAEA safeguards inspectors to conduct essential verification activities at the plant.\n\n\"We would also provide impartial and independent information about the status of the Zaporizhzhia facility,\" Grossi noted. \"That this vital mission has not yet happened is not because of the IAEA. Despite our determined efforts, it has not been possible, so far. I will not give up. I will continue to push - and push again - for this IAEA mission to finally take place. But this will need the cooperation, understanding and facilitation from both Ukraine and Russia.\"\n\nIn a later update IAEA said Ukraine had informed the IAEA that the shelling had damaged the plant's external power supply system but that two power lines remained operational. It had also triggered the emergency protection system of one of the plant's three operating reactors. This unit was disconnected from the grid as a result.\n\nUkraine also informed the IAEA that there had been no damage to the reactors themselves, no radiological release and no reports of injuries. However, it said a nitrogen-oxygen station, which supports plant operations, and an auxiliary building were damaged. Firefighters had quickly extinguished a fire at the nitrogen-oxygen station, but it still needs to be repaired, Ukraine said. The IAEA has also received information about shelling near the used fuel storage facility.\n\nIAEA said that on 6 August, two of the ZNPP's six units were operating and the radiation situation was normal, according to Ukraine. Grossi said IAEA experts had made a preliminary assessment that the current nuclear safety and security situation at the ZNPP seemed stable, with no immediate threat to nuclear safety.\n\nReuters said on 5 August that Russia and Ukraine had accused each other of shelling ZNPP. Russia's defence ministry said it was only by luck that a radiation accident had been avoided after what it described as an artillery barrage. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Moscow was responsible and accused it of committing \"an open, brazen crime, an act of terror\".\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said the generating capacity of one unit had been reduced and power supply to another had been cut. In addition, the nearby city of Energodar, where most of the plant operators live, had power and water supply problems, it said.\n\n\"Fortunately, the Ukrainian shells did not hit the oil and fuel facility and the oxygen plant nearby, thus avoiding a larger fire and a possible radiation accident,\" a ministry statement said. The Russian-installed administration of Energodar said power lines at the plant had been cut by a Ukrainian artillery strike. Reuters said it was unable to verify the battlefield reports.\n\nEnergodar and ZNPP were taken over by Russian troops in early March. However, the facility continues to be run by its Ukrainian technicians. Reportedly some specialists from Russia's Rosatom are also at the plant. Russia has said on several occasions that it would facilitate an IAEA visit. However, Ukraine's nuclear utility Energoatom has repeatedly refused to permit this.

In early April, Ukrainian militants already made two attempts to blow up tanks with pesticides at the Zarya large chemical plant in the town of Rubizhnoe.\n\nThe staging of the use of WMD is usually aimed at accusing Russia of using prohibited weapons and then imposing various restrictions against it, including exclusion from various international organizations, including the UN Security Council.\n\nA possible scenario for the development of the situation is also to put pressure on countries loyal and friendly to the Russian Federation, including India and China, forcing them to impose sanctions.\n\nAn important circumstance is the fact that on September 27, 2017, the Russian Federation completely destroyed the existing chemical arsenal, which is confirmed by the OPCW certificate. In turn, the United States remains the only country party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which still has an impressive arsenal of toxic substances (672.5 tons), and continues to develop in this direction.\n\nThe United States is the only state in world history to have used all three types of WMD. The dropped nuclear bombs during the Second World War on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the use of toxic chemicals in Vietnam and Iraq - all these crimes were not properly assessed by relevant international organizations.", "source": {"uri": "thecitizen.co.tz", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Citizen"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/resource/blob/3907502/48214ff65d6e16be717d7d46ec4a9941/iaea-data.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 17, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 30, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144072329", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "14:36:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T14:36:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T14:30:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5764706134796143, "url": "https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/IAEA-Sees-Very-Real-Risk-Of-A-Nuclear-Disaster-In-Ukraine.html", "title": "IAEA Sees  ", "body": "The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has warned that there is a \"very real risk of a nuclear disaster\" due to the situation around the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine due to regular shelling.\n\nIn a tweet, Grossi said, \"The @iaeaorg team must go to Zaporizhia just as we did to Chornobyl and South Ukraine earlier in the year.

As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports, Ukraine and Russia accuse each other of shelling the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station -- a sprawling facility on Russian occupied ground that continues to function as the war rages around it.\n\nRussian emergency services released images of damage around the plant after both sides traded fresh accusations of shelling the compound.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the renewed shelling as \"Russian nuclear terror,\" as the United Nations-backed global nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, expressed grave concern about the safety of plant and called for a team of its inspectors to be allowed immediate access.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Monday morning that any that \"any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing.\"\n\nUkraine's nuclear power operator Energoatom said Russian shelling damaged three radiation monitors around a storage facility containing spent fuel rods at the Zaporizhzhia facility and left one worker injured. Russian news agencies quoted the Moscow-backed rebels who control the territory as saying Ukrainian forces had fired the shells.\n\nRussian or Russian-backed forces have controlled the nuclear plant for most of the last year, and Energoatom said the troops based at the facility took shelter in bunkers before the shells struck on Saturday.\n\nShelling around Zaporizhzhia was just one example of Russia's ongoing aerial assault amid fierce battles between Ukraine's military and Moscow's invading forces. As D'Agata reports, dozens of towns along the front lines in southeast Ukraine were hit over the weekend.\n\nRussian missiles and artillery hammered the city of Mykolaiv, southwest of the nuclear plant and just north of Ukraine's major Black Sea ports. Despite the fighting, more ships carrying vital food supplies have managed to leave those ports, including from the city of Odesa.\n\nAs of Monday about 10 more ships had been cleared to sail, but as D'Agata reports, there's a backlog of around 20 million tons of grain waiting to ship out under the protection of a deal struck last month between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nWhile the slow, but so-far-steady stream of ships chips away at that backlog to get the food out to the world, Ukraine's farmers in front-line towns and villages are putting their lives on the line to harvest this year's crops.\n\nD'Agata says that while the tug-of-war over the country's grain may have shifted in Ukraine's favor right now with the agreement on exports, in addition to the overflowing silos at the ports, millions more tons of wheat, corn and other food staples are still piling up on farms in the region. Third generation farmer Yurri Yalovchuk told CBS News that if the grain deal collapses, so too will his farm just north of Odesa. \"We do not have much trust in Russians,\" he told D'Agata. \"They can strike the grain ships with a missile at any moment.\"\n\nHe said he was banking on shipping out this year's harvest first, before clearing last year's backlogged crops, as his grain is worth more while it's still fresh, and he's got nowhere to store it anyway.\n\nYalovchuk's harvest from last year -- along with that of hundreds of other Ukrainian farmers -- is likely among the millions of tons of grain still stuck in warehouses across the country.\n\nBut even as the farmers work to pull in this year's crops, Russia's forces are attacking their fields, farms and storage facilities across the south and east. D'Agata says some have even started working their land in flak jackets.\n\nWhole fields of crops have been torched as the two sides exchange fire, with families' livelihoods wiped out and some of the world's hungriest people being starved of vital food supplies in the process.\n\nMassive disruptions to the supply chain predicted by experts\n\nUkraine says Russia is \"systematically\" stealing its children", "source": {"uri": "news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/B51jy4aAxgJxmTlozW7Wig--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_jtM3lYTYMiYrlFtdw4.8g--~B/aD0zNTcyO3c9NTM1ODthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbs_news_897/46a096560d85c68ae57e0df3d48a3314", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 21, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 28, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7145401930", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-09", "time": "15:24:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-09T15:24:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-09T14:39:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5764706134796143, "url": "https://journalnow.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/large-explosions-rock-russian-military-air-base-in-crimea/article_1ec3382d-7f96-5ee9-9cec-a99eb54478f8.html", "title": "Large explosions rock Russian military air base in Crimea", "body": "By SUSIE BLANN - Associated Press\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- An explosion of munitions caused a fire at a military air base in Russian-annexed Crimea Tuesday but no casualties or damage to stationed warplanes, Russia's Defense Ministry said.\n\nVideos posted on social networks showed sunbathers fleeing a nearby beach as huge clouds of smoke from the explosions rose over the horizon.\n\nThe defense ministry emphasized that the Saki base hadn't come under shelling.

Valentyn Reznichenko said. Several apartment buildings and industrial facilities were damaged, he said.\n\nUkraine and Russia accused each other in recent days of shelling the nuclear plant, which is the largest one in Europe, and increasing the risks of a nuclear accident.\n\nIn his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy invoked the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine, which at the time was a Soviet republic. He called for new sanctions against Russia \"for creating the threat\" of another nuclear disaster.\n\n\"We are actively informing the world about Russian nuclear blackmail -- about the shelling and mining of the Zaporizhzhia NPP facilities,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Russia will not pay attention to words and concerns ... The Chernobyl disaster is an explosion in one reactor; the Zaporizhzhia NPP is six power units.\"\n\nThe Kremlin claimed Monday that Ukraine's military was attacking the plant and urged Western powers to force Kyiv to stop the activity.\n\nA Russian-installed official in the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia region said an air defense system at the plant would be reinforced in the aftermath of last week's shelling. Evgeny Balitsky, the head of the Kremlin-backed administration, told Russian state TV Tuesday that power lines and damaged blocks of the plant were restored.\n\n\"The plant is operating normally, but, of course, with an increased degree of security,\" Balitsky said.\n\nA Ukrainian counteroffensive and Russian defensive actions in occupied areas have increasingly drawn firepower to southern Ukraine.\n\nDrones are playing a crucial role in Ukraine's military operations in the southern Mykolaiv region where Russian shelling has been escalating in recent weeks.\n\nThe leader of a Ukrainian reconnaissance team named \"Fireflies\" -- who goes by the nom de guerre \"Baton\" -- said his unit is using drones to monitor and combat any Russian attempt to seize more territory in the region.\n\n\"This is a war of artillery and drones,\" Baton told reporters, as he observed smoke rising after an attack on a Russian position a few kilometers away on a monitor with the feed sent from the vehicle.\n\nDrones are the only \"eyes,\" Baton said.\n\nAfter failing to capture Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, early in the war, the Russian military focused its strength on trying to seize all of the country's eastern Donbas region. Pro-Moscow separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the region for eight years and control some territory as self-proclaimed republics.\n\nThe British Defense Ministry said Tuesday that Russian forces had made the most progress in the past month in moving toward the town of Bakhmut -- an advance limited to about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles).\n\n\"In other Donbas sectors where Russia was attempting to break through, its forces have not gained more than 3 km during this 30-day period; almost certainly significantly less than planned,\" the U.K. ministry said.\n\nHowever, the ministry cautioned that despite the attention required in southern Ukraine, Russia had maintained attacks on Ukrainian positions in the east.\n\nThe governor of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk province, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said the Russians were trying to press their offensive in several areas. Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, came under Russian shelling four times over the past 24 hours, and some city infrastructure was damaged.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Construction began in 1980 and its sixth reactor was connected to the grid in 1995.\n\nPressurised water is used to transfer heat away from the reactor and to slow down neutrons to enable the Uranium 235 to continue its chain reaction.\n\nIf the water was cut, and auxiliary systems such as diesel generators failed to keep the reactor cool due to an attack, then the nuclear reaction would slow though the reactor would heat up very swiftly.\n\nAt such high temperatures, hydrogen could be released from the zirconium cladding and the reactor could start to melt down.\n\nAt least two reactors are still working at the plant.\n\nBesides the reactors, there is also a dry spent fuel storage facility at the site for used nuclear fuel assemblies, and spent fuel pools at each reactor site which are used to cool down the used nuclear fuel.\n\n\"The basins of spent fuel are just big pools with uranium fuel rods in them - they are really hot depending on how long they have been there,\" said Kate Brown, an environmental historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology whose book \"Manual for Survival\" documents the full scale of the Chernobyl disaster.\n\n\"If fresh water is not put in then the water will evaporate. Once the water evaporates then the zirconium cladding will heat up and it can catch on fire and then we have a bad situation - a fire of irradiated uranium which is very like the Chernobyl situation releasing a whole complex of radioactive isotopes.\"\n\nAn emission of hydrogen from a spent fuel pool caused an explosion at reactor 4 in the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.\n\nAccording to a 2017 Ukrainian submission to the IAEA, there were 3,354 spent fuel assemblies at the dry spent fuel facility and around 1,984 spent fuel assemblies in the pools.\n\nThat is a total of more than 2,200 tonnes of nuclear material excluding the reactors, according to the document.\n\nAfter invading Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russian forces took control of the plant in early March.\n\nUkrainian staff continue to operate it, but special Russian military units guard the facility and Russian nuclear specialists give advice.\n\nIf there was a nuclear accident, it is unclear who would deal with it during a war, said Brown.\n\n\"We don't know what happens in a wartime situation when we have a nuclear emergency,\" Brown said. \"In 1986 everything was running as well as it ran in the Soviet Union so they could mobilise tens of thousands of people and equipment and emergency vehicles to the site.\"\n\n\"Who would be taking charge of that operation right now?\"\n\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR?\n\nThe plant was struck in March but there was no radiation leak and the reactors were intact. Both Russia and Ukraine blamed each other for that strike. read more\n\nIn July, Russia said Ukraine had repeatedly struck the territory of the plant with drones and missiles. Pro-Ukrainian social media said \"kamikaze drones\" had struck Russian forces near the plant.\n\nReuters was unable to immediately verify battlefield accounts of either side.\n\n- Aug. 5: The plant was shelled twice. Power lines were damaged. An area near the reactors was hit.\n\nRussia said that Ukraine's 45th Artillery Brigade also struck the territory of the plant with 152-mm shells from the opposite side of the Dnipro river. Ukraine's state nuclear power company, Energoatom, said Russia fired at the plant with rocket-propelled grenades.\n\n- Aug. 6: shelled again, possibly twice. An area next to the dry spent nuclear fuel storage facility was hit.\n\nEnergoatom said Russia fired rockets at the plant. The Russian forces said Ukraine struck it with a 220-mm Uragan rocket launcher.\n\n- Aug. 7: shelled again\n\nRussia said Ukraine's 44th Artillery Brigade struck the plant, damaging a high-voltage line.

While we fully stand by our findings, we regret the pain caused.\"\n\nZelenskiy accused the group of trying to shift responsibility from Russian aggression, while Amnesty's Ukraine head, Oksana Pokalchuk, quit, saying the report was a propaganda gift for Moscow.\n\nUkrainian officials say they try to evacuate civilians from front-line areas. Russia, which denies targeting civilians, has not commented on the rights report.\n\nIn its email on Sunday, Amnesty said it had found Ukrainian forces next to civilian residences in 19 towns and villages it visited, exposing them to risk of incoming Russian fire.\n\n\"This does not mean that Amnesty International holds Ukrainian forces responsible for violations committed by Russian forces, nor that the Ukrainian military is not taking adequate precautions elsewhere in the country,\" it said.\n\n\"We must be very clear: Nothing we documented Ukrainian forces doing in any way justifies Russian violations.\"\n\nPope Francis welcomed the departure from Ukrainian Black Sea ports of the first ships carrying grain previously blockaded by Russia, saying the breakthrough could be a model for dialogue to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nAt his weekly address to pilgrims and tourists in St. Peter's Square on Sunday, Pope Francis said:\n\n.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}This step shows that it is possible to conduct dialogue to reach concrete results, which help everyone.\n\nThis event presents itself as a sign of hope and my own heartfelt wish is that following this path, it will be possible to bring an end to the fighting and reach a just and lasting peace.\n\nThe Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for stronger international response to Russia's \"nuclear terror\" after reported new shelling at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear power plant.

Construction began in 1980 and its sixth reactor was connected to the grid in 1995.\n\nPressurised water is used to transfer heat away from the reactor and to slow down neutrons to enable the Uranium 235 to continue its chain reaction.\n\nIf the water was cut, and auxiliary systems such as diesel generators failed to keep the reactor cool due to an attack, then the nuclear reaction would slow though the reactor would heat up very swiftly.\n\nAt such high temperatures, hydrogen could be released from the zirconium cladding and the reactor could start to melt down.\n\nAt least two reactors are still working at the plant.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE SPENT FUEL?\n\nBesides the reactors, there is also a dry spent fuel storage facility at the site for used nuclear fuel assemblies, and spent fuel pools at each reactor site which are used to cool down the used nuclear fuel.\n\n\"The basins of spent fuel are just big pools with uranium fuel rods in them - they are really hot depending on how long they have been there,\" said Kate Brown, an environmental historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology whose book \"Manual for Survival\" documents the full scale of the Chernobyl disaster.\n\n\"If fresh water is not put in then the water will evaporate. Once the water evaporates then the zirconium cladding will heat up and it can catch on fire and then we have a bad situation - a fire of irradiated uranium which is very like the Chernobyl situation releasing a whole complex of radioactive isotopes.\"\n\nAn emission of hydrogen from a spent fuel pool caused an explosion at reactor 4 in the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.\n\nAccording to a 2017 Ukrainian submission to the IAEA, there were 3,354 spent fuel assemblies at the dry spent fuel facility and around 1,984 spent fuel assemblies in the pools.\n\nThat is a total of more than 2,200 tonnes of nuclear material excluding the reactors, according to the document https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/national_report_of_ukraine_for_the_6th_review_meeting_-_english.pdf.\n\nWHO CONTROLS IT?\n\nAfter invading Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russian forces took control of the plant in early March.\n\nUkrainian staff continue to operate it, but special Russian military units guard the facility and Russian nuclear specialists give advice.\n\nIf there was a nuclear accident, it is unclear who would deal with it during a war, said Brown.\n\n\"We don't know what happens in a wartime situation when we have a nuclear emergency,\" Brown said. \"In 1986 everything was running as well as it ran in the Soviet Union so they could mobilise tens of thousands of people and equipment and emergency vehicles to the site.\"\n\n\"Who would be taking charge of that operation right now?\"\n\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR?\n\nThe plant was struck in March but there was no radiation leak and the reactors were intact. Both Russia and Ukraine blamed each other for that strike.\n\nIn July, Russia said Ukraine had repeatedly struck the territory of the plant with drones and missiles. Pro-Ukrainian social media said \"kamikaze drones\" had struck Russian forces near the plant.\n\nReuters was unable to immediately verify battlefield accounts of either side.\n\n- Aug. 5: The plant was shelled twice. Power lines were damaged. An area near the reactors was hit.\n\nRussia said that Ukraine's 45th Artillery Brigade also struck the territory of the plant with 152-mm shells from the opposite side of the Dnipro river. Ukraine's state nuclear power company, Energoatom, said Russia fired at the plant with rocket-propelled grenades.\n\n- Aug. 6: shelled again, possibly twice. An area next to the dry spent nuclear fuel storage facility was hit.\n\nEnergoatom said Russia fired rockets at the plant. The Russian forces said Ukraine struck it with a 220-mm Uragan rocket launcher.\n\n- Aug. 7: shelled again\n\nRussia said Ukraine's 44th Artillery Brigade struck the plant, damaging a high-voltage line. Russia's defence ministry said power at reactors 5 and 6 was reduced to 500 megawatts.\n\n(Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Andrew Heavens)", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vGsAo02SYCSakW2z_jKkfA--~B/aD01MjM7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/b5e5793f89e4211169b2b60cfa90ddb9", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 18, "stanza_neu": 24, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 43, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144352820", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "19:26:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T19:26:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T19:25:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5647059082984924, "url": "https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/russia-ukraine-trade-accusations-over-nuclear-plant-attacks-2022-08-08/", "title": "Russia, Ukraine trade accusations over nuclear plant attacks", "body": "In this handout photo taken from video and released by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Sunday, Aug. 7, 2022, a general view of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station in territory under Russian military control, southeastern Ukraine.

(AP Photo/Khalil Hamra)\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia and Ukraine traded accusations Monday that each side is shelling Europe's biggest nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. Russia claimed that Ukrainian shelling caused a power surge and fire and forced staff to lower output from two reactors, while Ukraine has blamed Russian troops for storing weapons there.\n\nNuclear experts have warned that more shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which was captured by Russia early in the war, is fraught with danger.\n\nThe Kremlin echoed that Monday, claiming that Kyiv was attacking the plant and urging Western powers to force a stop to that.\n\n\"Shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is highly dangerous,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. \"It's fraught with catastrophic consequences for vast territories, for the entire Europe.\"\n\nBut Ukraine's military intelligence spokesman, Andriy Yusov, countered that Russian forces have planted explosives at the plant to head off an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive in the region. Previously, Ukrainian officials have said Russia is launching attacks from the plant and using Ukrainian workers there as human shields.\n\nYusov called on Russia to \"make a goodwill gesture and hand over control of the plant to an international commission and the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), if not to the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nUkraine's ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, likewise urged that the United Nations, the IAEA and the international community send a delegation to \"completely demilitarize the territory\" and provide security guarantees to plant employees and the city where the plant is based, Enerhodar.\n\nHe accused Russia of \"nuclear terrorism.\"\n\nThe IAEA is the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog. Its director-general, Rafael Grossi, told The Associated Press last week that the situation surrounding the Zaporizhzhia plant \"is completely out of control,\" and issued an urgent plea to Russia and Ukraine to allow experts to visit the complex to stabilize the situation and avoid a nuclear accident.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced support for that idea Monday, saying, \"any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing.\"\n\nOne expert in nuclear materials at Imperial College London said the reactor at Zaporizhzhia is modern and housed inside a heavily reinforced steel-and-concrete building designed to protect against disasters.\n\n\"As such, I do not believe there would be a high probably of a breach of the containment building, even if it was accidently struck by an explosive shell, and even less likely the reactor itself could be damaged,\" said Mark Wenman at the college's Nuclear Energy Futures.\n\nHe also said the complex's spent fuel tanks, where the shells reportedly hit, are strong and probably don't contain much spent fuel.\n\n\"Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would be illegal according to international law, the likelihood of a serious nuclear release is still small,\" he said.\n\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the attack Sunday caused a power surge and smoke, triggering an emergency shutdown. Fire teams extinguished flames, and the plant's personnel lowered the output of reactors No. 5 and No. 6 to 500 megawatts, he said.\n\nOn the front lines of the war, the fighting continued as the United States pledged another $1 billion in new military aid for Ukraine. Monday's pledge promises the biggest yet delivery of rockets, ammunition and other arms straight from U.S. Department of Defense stocks for Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe latest announcement brings total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine by the Biden administration to $9.1 billion since Russian troops invaded on Feb. 24.\n\nUkraine's presidential office said the Russians had shelled seven Ukrainian regions over the previous 24 hours, killing five people. Russia said Monday it will keep up its military operation in Ukraine until it achieves its goals.\n\nAmong the targets, the presidential office said, was Nikopol, a city just across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Gas pipelines, plumbing and power lines were no longer functioning there, leaving thousands of people without electricity.\n\nElsewhere, Ukrainian forces struck Russian-controlled areas in the south, local officials said, including the strategic Antonivskiy bridge in the southern city of Kherson. An artery for Russian military supplies, the bridge has been closed in recent weeks because of earlier shelling. Plans to reopen it on Wednesday were now shelved, said Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of the Kherson region.\n\nIn Melitopol, a Russian-controlled city in the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region, the mayor said Ukraine used U.S. HIMARS rocket launchers to shell several Russian military facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the ships that left Ukraine under a deal to unblock grain supplies and stave off a global food crisis arrived in Turkey, the first loaded vessel to reach its destination. The Turkey-flagged Polarnet, laden with 12,000 tons of corn, docked at the port of Derince after setting off from the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk on Friday.\n\n\"This sends a message of hope to every family in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia: Ukraine won't abandon you,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. \"If Russia sticks to its obligations, the 'grain corridor' will keep maintaining global food security.\"\n\nYet Polarnet Captain Ahmet Yucel Alibeyler noted the risks faced by ships trying to cross the Black Sea.\n\n\"These were, of course, dangerous areas, corridors that had been cleared, demined,\" he said.\n\nA total of 12 ships have now been authorized to sail under the grain deal between Ukraine and Russia, which was brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- 10 outbound and two inbound. Some 322,000 metric tons of agricultural products have left Ukrainian ports, the bulk of it corn but also sunflower oil and soya.\n\nFour ships that left Ukraine on Sunday are expected to anchor near Istanbul on Monday evening for inspection Tuesday to make sure they are carrying only food items.\n\nThe first cargo ship to leave Ukraine, the Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, which left Odessa on Aug. 1, hit a snag with its cargo, however. It was heading for Lebanon with 26,000 metric tons of corn for chicken feed but ran into a business dispute and will no longer dock there, the Tripoli port chief said. Ukraine's embassy in Beirut tweeted Monday that the corn's buyer in Lebanon refused to accept the cargo, since it was delivered so much later than its contract. A new buyer is being sought.\n\n___\n\nKareem Chehayeb in Beirut, Mehmet Guzel in Derince, Turkey, and Andrew Wilks in Istanbul contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nWhoever coined the expression that patience is a virtue probably never invested money in the equity markets.

Region: France and French Territories -\n\nSource: United Nations - in French 2\n\nHeadline: War in Ukraine: attacking nuclear power plant is suicidal, says UN chief\n\nOn the 168th day of the conflict in Ukraine, the United Nations continues to alert after bombings on the site of the Ukrainian nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia.\n\nAt a press conference on Monday in Tokyo, Japan, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said it was inconceivable that nuclear power plants would be attacked in the context of the Ukrainian conflict. \"Any attack on nuclear power plants is a suicidal thing,\" Guterres said.\n\nHere in Japan, paper cranes symbolize the hope for a future without nuclear weapons.\n\nThere is only one solution to the nuclear threat: not to have nuclear weapons at all. pic.twitter.com/05QM9dHKNa\n\n-- Ant\u00f3nio Guterres (@antonioguterres) August 7, 2022\n\nOn Saturday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) deemed \"increasingly alarming\" information from the Zaporizhia power plant, one of whose reactors had to be shut down after Friday's attack.\n\n\"I hope these attacks will end. At the same time, I hope that the IAEA will be able to access the plant (Zaporijjia) and exercise the competences entrusted to it\", pointed out Mr. Guterres, recalling \"fully supporting the IAEA in all its efforts to create the conditions for stabilizing this plant\".\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Saturday deemed \"increasingly alarming\" the information from the Zaporizhzhia power plant, one of whose reactors had to be shut down after the attack the day before. \"Ukraine has informed the IAEA that the bombings damaged the power plant's external power supply system, but that two power lines remained operational,\" IAEA Director Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nAccording to the UN agency, these strikes also triggered the emergency protection system of one of the plant's three operating reactors. \"This unit was disconnected from the network following the events of Friday, said Ukraine\", indicated Mr. Grossi, noting that these strikes demonstrated a \"real risk of nuclear disaster that could threaten health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond\".\n\nDuring this press briefing in Japan, the Head of the UN also addressed the other challenges of the Ukrainian conflict. In response to a question about the next UN mission in this war, Mr. Guterres pointed out that there are \"many other problems in which the United Nations is ready to intervene\".\n\nIn this regard, he insisted on the role of humanitarian agencies and their important operations in this country. But all these efforts are conditioned in the long term by peace on the ground. \"We are ready to mediate on any practical issue where we can help resolve some of the issues, the pending issues, that are created by the conflict, but of course the most important goal is peace,\" he remarked.\n\nThe UN is \"always ready to use its good offices to promote a peaceful solution to the Ukrainian conflict\", in accordance with the UN Charter and international law.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This article is a translation.

Strikes in the area of the Antonovskiy bridge.\"\n\nNatalia Gumeniuk, the southern army command spokesperson, confirmed the attack, telling Ukrainian television, \"The firing system we have developed in recent days shows results.\"\n\nShe added, \"The impact has been considerable for both the Antonovskiy and Kakhovskiy bridges.\"\n\nRussian-backed forces also confirmed the strikes.\n\nThe Antonovskiy bridge provides the main land supply link between Russian-occupied Kherson and the south bank of the Dnieper River. On July 27, Ukraine partly destroyed the bridge, forcing Russia to rethink its supply lines.\n\nBy contrast, Kirill Stremusov, the deputy head of the Russian-backed Kherson regional administration, told Russian state-run RIA Novosti, \"There was one strike, a construction booth and a cement mixer caught fire. There is damage to the bridge floor, which means we will continue restoring it.\"\n\nStremusov said, \"There is no critical damage, the structural elements of the transport crossing were not damaged.\"\n\nRussia has resorted to pontoon boats to facilitate crossings.\n\nKherson is located only a few kilometers from the front line. It was the first major city to fall to Russia in the early days of the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUsing Western-supplied arms, Kyiv's forces hope to retake the city of almost 300,000. However, Moscow plans to stage referendums there with an eye toward annexing the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\nHere are the other main headlines from the war in Ukraine on August 8.\n\nRussia said it was suspending US on-site inspections under the strategic arms control treaty (START) with Washington.\n\nInspection conditions created \"unilateral advantages for the United States and effectively deprive the Russian Federation of the right to conduct inspections on American territory,\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\nRussia insisted it remained fully committed to complying with all the provisions of the nuclear arms pact.\n\nThe treaty limits each party to 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) or deployed submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), 1,550 nuclear warheads on deployed ICBMs and SLBMs, and 800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers.\n\nIt also envisions a rigorous inspection regime to verify compliance.\n\nThe statement indicated it had become hard for Moscow to conduct inspections on American soil due to Western sanctions, including the closure of air space for Russian planes and visa restrictions.\n\nMoscow also pointed to a new spike in coronavirus cases in the United States.\n\nThe United States will provide $1 billion ( \u20ac980 million) in new military aid for Ukraine the Pentagon said.\n\nIt would be the largest-yet delivery of arms from US stockpiles.\n\nPentagon spokesman Todd Breasseale said the delivery would include munitions for long-range weapons and armored medical transport vehicles.\n\nThe package adds to about $8.8 billion in aid the US has given Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February.\n\nIt also includes more surface-to-air missiles for defense against Russian aircraft and rockets, more Javelin anti-armor rockets, and other ammunition.\n\n\"These are all critical capabilities to help the Ukrainians repel the Russian offensive in the east, and also to address evolving developments in the south and elsewhere,\" said Under Secretary of Defense Colin Kahl.\n\nSeparately, the World Bank announced Monday $4.5 billion in aid for Ukraine paid for by the United States.\n\nThe funds will help Kyiv pay for services and pensions, key to easing economic impacts of the Russian invasion, the bank said in a statement.\n\n\"This economic assistance is critical in supporting the Ukrainian people as they defend their democracy against Russia's unprovoked war of aggression,\" US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for international inspectors to be granted access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant following fresh shelling at the facility, the largest in Europe, over the weekend.\n\nGuterres said an attack on a nuclear power plant \"is a suicidal thing,\" during a press conference in Japan.\n\nPetro Kotin, the head of Ukraine's state nuclear power company Enerhoatom, called for peacekeepers to be deployed at the plant following a worker injury due to shelling Sunday.\n\nWhile the plant is Russian-occupied, Ukrainian employees from Enerhoatom continue to do their best to manage the facility and prevent a Chernobyl-like catastrophe.\n\nYevhenii Tsymbaliuk, Ukraine's ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said Russia is shelling the nuclear power plant in an effort to cause blackouts in southern Ukraine. He reiterated calls for the IAEA and the UN to be given better access.\n\nWhile Ukraine blamed Russia for this weekend's shelling of the plant, the Russian Embassy in Washington claimed two high voltage powerlines and a water pipeline had been damaged during shelling it alleged was carried out by the Ukrainian side.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov tried to force blame on the Ukrainians for safety incidents at the plant since Russian forces seized it.\n\n\"We expect the countries that have absolute influence on the Ukrainian leadership to use this influence in order to rule out the continuation of such shelling,\" Peskov said.\n\nRussia's state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported Russia is ready to facilitate a visit from IAEA inspectors.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that a \"power surge\" occurred at the plant, causing smoke in a switch gear. The ministry said firefighters at the scene were unable to stop the smoke.\n\nDespite the statements of more senior officials, Yevgeniy Balitsky, the Russian-backed head of the local administration, claimed the plant continued to work in \"normal mode.\"\n\nThe Russia-installed head of the Zaporizhzhia region that is home to the nuclear plant also signed a decree paving the way for a referendum to join Russia, Russian state-run RIA Novosti said.\n\nUkraine's southern military command said it had received three Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft systems from Germany.\n\nThe Gepard air defense systems require three people to operate and can hit targets up to four kilometers (2.5 miles) away.\n\nIt is the latest shipment of weapons and war materiel Ukraine has confirmed it received from Western nations, many of which are members of the NATO alliance, such as Germany.\n\nUkraine is not a NATO member but has sought membership in the past. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said his country would not be at war now had NATO accepted Ukraine as a NATO member state.\n\nA new report from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) defense think tank in the UK indicates that 450 foreign-made components were found in Russian weapons recovered in Ukraine. The evidence suggests Moscow acquired critical technology from companies in the West and Asia prior to launching its February 24 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSince then, Ukraine has captured and recovered from the battlefield a range of Russian weapons and weapons systems. Some of those systems were damaged in fighting while others remain largely intact.\n\nWhen the Ukrainians disassembled Russia's battlefield weapons, they found 27 weapons systems, including cruise missiles and air defense, had relied on Western components.\n\nRUSI found two-thirds of those components came from US-based manufacturers. Products by Analog Devices and Texas Instruments were the most popular in the Russian weapons systems Ukraine recovered.\n\nGermany, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Switzerland, and the UK also produced components located in the Russians' weapons systems.\n\nFor instance, a Russian 9M727 cruise missile capable of maneuvering at low altitude to evade radar systems that can also hit targets from a distance of hundreds of kilometers, was found to contain 31 different foreign parts. Those parts came from companies including Texas Instruments Inc, Advanced Micro Devices Inc, and Germany's Cypress Semiconductor, now owned by Infineon AG.\n\nThe research is the most detailed public assessment to date of the role Western components have played in Russia's military operations. Companies asked about their components being found in Russian weapons systems said they had followed export law and had now ceased selling parts to Russia.\n\nRUSI's research also serves to highlight that Russia remains dependent on foreign microchips for use in everything from tactical radios to drones and precision-guided long-range munitions.\n\nPolarnet, a Turkish-flagged ship carrying Ukrainian maize, reached the port of Kocaeli on the Sea of Marmara, becoming the first ship carrying Ukrainian grain to reach its final destination since Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nAt least 10 ships have left Ukraine's ports following a deal brokered by Turkey and the UN with Kyiv and Moscow to bring Ukrainian grain to market, averting a global food crisis triggered by high prices and supply shortages.\n\nThe first vessel to leave the Pivdennyi port in Ukraine also sailed for Italy Monday.\n\nThe UK's morning military intelligence briefing focused on Russia's use of anti-personnel mines, calling their deployment \"highly likely\" along their defensive lines in the Donbas.\n\nSpecifically, the UK suggested Russia may be deploying PFM-1 series, known as butterfly mines. The UK believes Russia is likely setting those mines in Kramatorsk and Donetsk, calling them \"deeply controversial, indiscriminate weapons.\"\n\nSpeaking in Japan, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned broadly of a nuclear arms race, calling on nuclear-armed nations to re-commit to a policy of no first use of those weapons in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nGermany's SPD has decided not to expel former German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der over his controversial work for Russian-state energy firms since he left office in 2005, allowing that he has not broken any party rules while garnering a tremendous amount of controversy.\n\nEmerging concerns about energy availability in Germany next winter in the wake of the war in Ukraine has left an open question as to how Germany's export-based economy may be shaped by a coming crisis.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.dw.com/image/62744690_6.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 16, "stanza_neu": 58, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 76, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7143929895", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "12:29:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T12:29:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T11:45:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5490196347236633, "url": "https://www.rador.ro/2022/08/08/ukraine-81/", "title": "UKRAINE", "body": "U.N.

They hit near the station's dry spent nuclear fuel cask storage facility. One of the employees of the station was injured, reported Energoatom, the state enterprise responsible for the operation of all nuclear stations in the country.\n\nThe company believes that Russians aimed precisely at dry cask storage containers with spent nuclear fuel, which is stored in the open near the sites of shelling. In total, there are 174 containers, each with 24 assemblies of spent nuclear fuel.\n\nAs a result of the shelling, three radiation monitoring sensors around the site were damaged. Energoatom explains that it is now impossible to detect and react in a timely manner in case of deterioration of the radiation situation or leakage of radiation from containers of spent nuclear fuel.\n\nAbout 800 square meters of window surfaces in various buildings of the station were damaged due to numerous small fragments from the explosions. As a result of the explosions, an employee of the ZNPP also received a shrapnel wound. He was hospitalized.\n\nEnergoatom assures that all Russian military personnel and personnel of the Russian Rosatom hid in advance in the plant's bunkers. In total, up to 500 Russian military personnel have been at the ZNPP site since the day it was captured.\n\nThe invaders also fired near the territory of the lightweight steel factory and at the water intake of the city of Enerhodar.\n\nBackground\n\nAfter the occupiers attacked the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on August 5, the power unit there was turned off. As of the morning of August 6, the ZNPP was operating with the risk of violating radiation and fire safety standards.\n\nEnergoatom said that as a result of the attack, the nitrogen-oxygen station and the combined auxiliary building were seriously damaged. There are also risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances, and the fire hazard is high.\n\nIn addition, the Russian military \"hid\" in the basements of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant -- they occupied all the basements where they hide from shelling. Regional governor Oleksandr Starukh said that after two power lines were damaged as a result of the Russians' attack on the ZNPP, a fire broke out, which was extinguished by employees of the State Emergency Service.\n\nCiting its source, The Insider writes that the Russian occupying forces were probably replacing the engine room of one of the power units of the ZNPP.

The design of the reactors at the ZNNP is much safer than at Chornobyl, but the entire Soviet Union liquidated the Chornobyl disaster, Now, in conditions of hostilities, no-one will liquidate this accident. Ukraine does not have the resources for this.\" she explained.\n\nOn August 8, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called for international inspectors to be given access to the nuclear facility.\n\n\"Any attack on a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,\" Guterres told a news conference in Japan. Guterres said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) needed access to the plant. \"We fully support the IAEA in all their efforts on creating the conditions of stabilization of the plant,\" Guterres said.\n\nAccording to experts, after a possible accident at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, radioactive isotopes of Cesium, iodine, and, in smaller quantities, strontium are released into the environment. It was what people faced as the result of the accident at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant in April 1986.\n\nCaesium is an analog of potassium. Potassium is important in our body and is found primarily in the muscles. On the other hand, Caesium easily replaces it and, while it is in the body, irradiates it, increasing the likelihood of cancer. The metal remains in ecosystems for a long time, from where it is difficult to remove and, therefore, difficult to avoid.\n\nIodine has a relatively short half-life of eight and a half days. In other words, it will almost disappear from the environment after a possible accident.\n\nThe problem is that the local Ukrainian population has an iodine deficiency. Radioactive iodine (if it appears in the environment) compensates for this deficiency and accumulates primarily in the thyroid gland. Its radioactive decay leads to irradiation of this organ and increases the likelihood of thyroid cancer appearing.\n\nStrontium, from the point of view of biology, is an analog of calcium (it is part of the bones). It means that it will also replace it in human beings and lead to the irradiation of tissue and organs.\n\nThe geographical territory of the damage will depend on the direction of the wind at the time of any accident. The Black Sea connects with the Mediterranean Sea, which means that in the event of a potential accident, radioactive pollution will spread throughout the basin and affect many European countries.",

This is the only way to influence Vladimir Putin,\" he added.\n\nMore than 450 foreign-made components have been found in Russian weapons recovered in Ukraine, evidence that Moscow acquired critical technology from companies in the United States, Europe and Asia in the years before the invasion, according to a new report.\n\nSince the start of the war five months ago, the Ukrainian military has captured or recovered from the battlefield intact or partially damaged Russian weapons.\n\nWhen disassembled, 27 of these weapons systems, ranging from cruise missiles to air defence, were found to rely predominantly on Western components, according to research by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) defence think-tank.\n\nThe US Defense Department Monday announced a $1 billion package of additional weapons and security assistance for Ukraine in the latest round of military aid.\n\nIt is \"the largest single drawdown of US arms and equipment\" since August 2021 using presidential authorities to drawdown from US military stockpiles, according to a Pentagon statement. This marks the eighteenth drawdown by the Pentagon.\n\nThe package for the first time will have munitions for the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), a US-Norwegian air defense system the Ukrainians need for shooting down Russian cruise missiles aimed at population centers.\n\nThe transfer of NASAMS itself could still be some days away according to US defense official. The first system to arrive is expected to be from Norway which can get it to Ukraine quicker than the US.\n\nThis assistance package focuses heavily on additional ammunition and weapons which Ukraine forces have used successfully against Russian forces in eastern Ukraine. There is additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), 75,000 rounds of 155mm artillery ammunition and 1,000 Javelin anti-tank weapons among key items. This is the first transfer of Javelin's announced since June. There are also hundreds of AT4 anti-armor weapons included.\n\nRussia is continuing acts of \"nuclear terrorism\" on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and its personnel, Dmytro Lubinets, Ukrainian Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights said.\n\nLubinets stated that according to \"International norms, an attack on a facility where nuclear or radiological materials are used is considered an act of nuclear terrorism. 'Nuclear terrorism' also includes actions aimed at disrupting, sabotaging, or manipulating operations at the plant that could lead to the release of radioactivity.\"\n\nLubinets called on the United Nations Secretary General, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the international community to take \"possible measures to send a security mission to the Zaporizhzhia NPP, to completely demilitarize the territory of the NPP, and to provide security guarantees to the employees of the nuclear plant and residents of the city of Enerhodar for the maintenance of the plant.\"\n\nHe added that he sent letters to international organizations with his appeal.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have traded blame for recent artillery and rocket fire around the nuclear plant in central Ukraine, which UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described as \"suicidal.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the director general of the IAEA, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said he was extremely concerned by the shelling \"which underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster that could threaten public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond.\"", "source": {"uri": "ifpnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Iran Front Page"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://ifpnews.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rank_math_overlay_thumb&id=254472&type=iran-front-page&secret=12fbbe327bdb475d3f1b8fa025ba1ce1", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 26, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 33, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144046237", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "14:13:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T14:13:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T13:39:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5137255191802979, "url": "https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2022/08/08/kremlin-accuses-kyiv-of-nuclear-plant-shelling-warns-of-catastrophic-consequences/", "title": "Kremlin accuses Kyiv of nuclear plant shelling, warns of 'catastrophic consequences' - Pakistan Today", "body": "Moscow: The Kremlin on Monday accused Ukrainian forces of firing on the Zaporizhzhia atomic power plant, warning of potential \"catastrophic consequences\" for Europe.\n\n\"The shelling of the territory of the nuclear plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is a potentially extremely dangerous activity... fraught with catastrophic consequences for a vast area, including the territory of Europe,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.\n\nHe called on Ukraine's allies \"to use their influence to prevent the continuation of such shelling\".\n\nRussia's defence ministry said on Monday that the Ukrainian army damaged a high-voltage power line that provides electricity to nearby regions.\n\nThe ministry added that a \"power surge\" took place at the station, causing smoke in a switchgear, used to protect electrical equipment.\n\nFirefighters at the scene were able to stop the smoke, the ministry said.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have blamed each other for strikes on the atomic power plant, where recent fighting sparked a UN warning of a potential nuclear disaster.", "source": {"uri": "pakistantoday.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pakistan Today"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Russian-flag.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 1, "stanza_neu": 6, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 7, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7142943680", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-07", "time": "13:52:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-07T13:52:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-07T13:52:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5098039507865906, "url": "https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2022/08/7/7362236/", "title": "Zelenskyy demands additional sanctions after strikes on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant", "body": "In a conversation with President of the European Council Charles Michel, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed the Russian attack on the Zaporizhzhia plant and demanded fresh sanctions on Russia's nuclear industry.\n\nSource: Zelenskyy on Twitter\n\nQuote from Zelenskyy: \"I spoke to Michel and told him about the situation on the battlefield, in particular at the Zaporizhzhia plant.

Reports from Ukraine suggest that Russia is shelling the site itself and satellite images reveal potential evidence of the bombing at the nuclear plant.\n\nThe latest update from Energoatom, Ukraine's state-controlled energy company, says that on 6 August Russians fired rockets at the ZNPP which landed directly next to spent fuel storage containers. It claims that three radiation monitoring sensors were damaged and one plant employee was taken to hospital with a shrapnel wound, but that the Russian troops still in control of ZNPP hid in bunkers at the site.\n\n\"This time a nuclear catastrophe was miraculously avoided, but miracles cannot last forever,\" said Energoatom. \"It is necessary to urgently put an end to the actions of Russian nuclear terrorists in order to protect Ukraine and the world from a nuclear disaster.\"\n\nRussian administrators in the region claim that it was Ukrainian forces that attacked the plant.\n\nThe director general of the IAEA, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said on 5 August that the situation at the ZNPP seemed stable and that there was no immediate threat to nuclear safety. But the IAEA has not been able to visit the facility in Ukraine's south since before the conflict began, and Grossi says efforts to restart inspections continue.\n\nThere are also unconfirmed reports that Russian troops have mined the ZNPP, with Ukraine's Centre for Strategic Communication claiming that a high-ranking Russian officer said \"there will be either Russian land or a scorched desert\" at the site.\n\nOlena Pareniuk, a scientist working at the Chernobyl site, which has since been returned to Ukrainian control, says that Russian troops at ZNPP seem to be taking risks with safety, as well as shelling the site itself.\n\n\"Russians took military vehicles with armour and explosives inside the machine hall of ZNPP,\" she says. \"That's literally the same building where the reactor is. They mounted artillery on the territory of NPP, shooting the nearest town, Nikopol. Ukrainians won't fire back, as no one wants to pose a danger to the NPP.\"\n\nShe warns that the same mistakes are being made with ZNPP as were with Chernobyl, risking the safety and effectiveness of staff to control the reactors.\n\n\"Staff could get tired and make a mistake, and it might be another Chernobyl. Explosives might explode, the turbine will be damaged and might also explode, and the nuclear fuel might leak into the environment,\" she says. \"Russians might be crazy enough to drain the cooling water from the spent nuclear fuel basin, the fuel will heat up and uranium will leak into the environment.\"", "source": {"uri": "newscientist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Scientist"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08141456/SEI_118434344.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 9, "stanza_neu": 11, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 20, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144221530", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "16:57:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T16:57:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T16:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4941176474094391, "url": "https://www.stiripesurse.ro/nationwide-measurements-confirm-normal-radiation-levels-in-romania_2504830.html", "title": "Nationwide measurements confirm normal radiation levels in Romania", "body": "Nationwide measurements in Romania confirm normal radiation levels, the National Commission for the Control of Nuclear Activities (CNCAN) announced on Monday following public information on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine.\n\n\"CNCAN, through its Operative Emergency Centre, constantly follows the developments by radiological monitoring,\" according to a press statement released by the commission on Monday.\n\nCNCAN says that the environmental monitoring system in Ukraine works normally and does not indicate exceeding normal values.\n\nIn Romania, the level of radiation is permanently monitored by the National Environmental Monitoring Network (RNSRM) with the National Environmental Protection Agency (ANPM).\n\nSpecialists of the National Radioactivity Reference Laboratory verify the monitored data 24/7 and submit them to the International Atomic Energy Agency so as to ensure prompt information to national and international decision-makers, as well as the public, Agerpres.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday called for international inspectors to have access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex after Ukraine and Russia accused each other of shelling Europe's largest nuclear facility over the weekend, according to the Reuters and France Presse news agencies.\n\n\"Any attack on a nuclear power plant is a suicidal thing,\" Guterres told a news conference in Japan.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Saturday considered increasingly alarming the information coming from the Zaporizhzhia power plant, where one of the reactors had to be stopped after an attack carried out the day before.", "source": {"uri": "stiripesurse.ro", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stiri pe surse"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://mediastiriv1.freenode.ro/image/201806/w800/media-152903976700314600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 2, "stanza_neu": 6, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 8, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144802745", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-09", "time": "06:37:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-09T06:37:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-09T06:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4941176474094391, "url": "https://www.sunnewsonline.com/concern-grows-over-situation-at-beleaguered-ukrainian-nuclear-plant/", "title": "Concern grows over situation at beleaguered Ukrainian nuclear plant -

Zaporizhzhya, the regional capital, is still under Kiev's control.\n\nIt is unclear how such a vote, which Ukraine would not recognise, will be organised.\n\nZelensky has already warned that referendums organised by the occupying forces would end all chances of peace talks with Russia.\n\nBalytskyi did not give a specific date for the planned vote. In the past, the beginning of September was discussed as a possible period.\n\nMeanwhile, a Russian soldier in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv was sentenced to 10 years in prison on charges of war crimes.\n\nThe court considered it proven that the tank soldier fired on a multi-storey apartment building, carrying out an order shortly after the war began at the end of February, Ukrainian public television reported on Monday.\n\nThe soldier had pleaded guilty and is to be imprisoned for 10 years, but the sentence will only become final after a possible appeal.

But Russia's seizures of Zaporizhzhia and the defunct power plant at Chernobyl in the early days of the war - though Chernobyl later returned to Ukrainian control - have highlighted that a decision to increase reliance on nuclear power would carry risks even beyond the familiar ones.\n\nAs Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic pointed out during Grossi's recent visit to this country, Australia has an exemplary record on nuclear safety. But one of the most important reasons for this is that we have a ban on using nuclear fission for power generation and have committed not to develop a nuclear arsenal under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\n\nIn recent times both these bans have returned to the spotlight, as the Coalition in opposition has raised the possibility of domestic nuclear power plants to address our energy needs.

This in effect amounts to rigging the power units containing two nuclear reactors with explosives, at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe.\n\nMoreover, the Russian forces have also planted mines along the shore of the ZNPP's cooling pond and the shore of the nearby Kakhovka reservoir.\n\n\"All of this might soon cause a nuclear and radiation disaster, the consequences of which will be felt not only by Ukraine, but by the whole of Europe,\" Energoatom has warned.\n\nEarlier: On 5 August, the Russian occupying forces seriously damaged the nitrogen-oxygen unit and the combined auxiliary building at the Zaporizhzhia NPP.

up attacks on Ukrainian positions in the eastern Donetsk region but has only managed to advance about 10 kilometers in the past month on its \"most successful axis\" there, according to U.K. military intelligence.\n\nIn its latest regular assessment, on August 9, British Defense Intelligence said Russian forces had not advanced more than three kilometers elsewhere in Donetsk, one of the two eastern regions where Russia-backed separatists have held large swaths of territory for the past eight years.\n\nSuch a pace is \"almost certainly significantly less than planned,\" the intelligence added.\n\n\"Despite its continued heavy use of artillery in these areas, Russia has not been able to generate capable combat infantry in sufficient numbers to secure more substantial advances,\" it said.\n\nBritish intelligence previously warned on August 8 that Russia was using anti-personnel mines in an effort to defend and hold its defense lines, with resulting risks to both the military and local civilian populations.\n\nThe Ukrainian Army's General Staff said early on August 9 that a Russian offensive is continuing toward the hub cities of Bakhmut and Avdiyivka in the eastern Donetsk region as the enemy tries to inflict \"maximum losses\" on Ukrainian forces.\n\nIt said the Russian Air Force was bombarding military facilities in the direction of Donetsk in support of artillery and other ground operations aimed at dislodging Ukrainian units from the front lines.\n\nBattlefield reports from either side in the rapidly developing conflict are difficult to confirm.\n\nBut Kyiv's military planners said their forces had repelled reconnaissance and offensive operations in a handful of settlements around Ivano-Daryivka, Bakhmut, and Zaitseve.\n\nThey said Russian forces had withdrawn after unsuccessful pushes around Avdiyivka and Krasnohorivka.\n\nWATCH: German-Built Howitzers Pound Russian Targets In Ukraine\n\nKyiv said two Russian warships armed with Kalibr cruise missiles are poised for battle off Ukraine's Black Sea coast.\n\nMeanwhile, international concern persisted over the weekend shelling of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant over potential for disaster at Europe's largest atomic facility.\n\nThe head of the Ukrainian nuclear power company Enerhoatom has urged that Zaporizhzhya be declared a military-free zone to avoid nuclear catastrophe.\n\nZaporizhzhya was seized early in the five-month-old invasion but continues to be manned by Ukrainian staff.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that \"any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing\" in calling on August 8 for international inspectors to be given access to Zaporizhzhya.\n\nThe Russian-installed head of the local administration was quoted by Interfax as saying on August 8 that the facility was operating \"in normal mode.\"\n\nWashington and the World Bank announced more support for Ukraine on the heels of U.S. President Joe Biden's committing this week to the single largest package of security assistance under his so-called drawdown authority with $1 billion in aid that includes long-range weapons and medical transport

since Russia's invasion began in February.\n\nThe World Bank said it will implement the U.S. grant, which it said is aimed at urgent needs including health-care, pensions, and social payments.\n\nAlso, Reuters cited a document in which Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and the United Nations pledged to ensure a 10-nautical-mile buffer zone for ships exporting Ukrainian grain through the

the plant creates a \"real risk of a nuclear disaster,\" as Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of shelling the facility.\n\n\"If, God forbid, the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant is damaged and a disaster happens, two missiles will instantly land in your decision-making centers,\" said panelist Yuri Kot, \"one in Washington and the other in London.\"\n\nThe video was tweeted by BBC Monitoring's Francis Scarr, who wrote, \"for those of you perhaps concerned about the absence of recent nuclear missile threats on Russian state TV, there was a new one today.\"\n\nRussian state television outlets have been pushing propaganda over the invasion of Ukraine in which guests and anchors have boasted about their country's nuclear weapons capabilities.\n\nThese threats have been stepped up following the successful test of the Sarmat international continental missile (ICBM).\n\nThe TV guests have said the capitals of western countries that back Kyiv could be targets for Russia's nuclear might, although they don't talk about Europe's missile defense systems, or the prospect of NATO retaliating if one of its members were attacked.\n\nThe military backing Kyiv has received from the U.K. and the U.S. and their allies has been a considerable bone of contention for Russian state television.\n\nThe U.S. and Ukraine have said the American-supplied M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) have helped Kyiv's forces hit Russian command centers and ammunition depots.\n\nIn July, Olga Skabeyeva said on the Russia-1 channel that U.S. military support for Ukraine could cause the war to spill over into a conflict between Russia and NATO, telling viewers, \"we'll go all the way to Warsaw.\"\n\nOn Monday, Kot also took aim at western military backing for Kyiv and how the war was being framed by Ukrainian allies.\n\n\"We all understand very well that they're generating a fictional reality and then there's the real reality which we're dealing with. I think it would make sense to directly address Ukraine and the countries supporting it,\" Kot said.\n\nNewsweek has contacted the British foreign office and the U.S. State Department for comment.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brendan_cole@newsweek.com", "name": "Brendan Cole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2093973/russian-yars.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=e073fa75a5e55a84981a94fc31aaabfa", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 6, "stanza_neu": 9, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 16, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144069464", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "14:33:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T14:33:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T14:23:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4470588266849518, "url": "https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/moscow-says-ukraine-taking-europe-hostage-by-shelling-nuclear-plant", "title": "Moscow says Ukraine 'taking Europe hostage' by shelling nuclear plant", "body": "MOSCOW -- Russia on Monday accused Kyiv of trying to \"take Europe hostage\" by shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine.\n\nIn a statement, Russia's foreign ministry said it wanted the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to visit the plant, Europe's largest nuclear facility, but that Kyiv was blocking a potential visit.\n\n\"They are taking the whole of Europe hostage and are not against setting fire to it for the sake of their Nazi idols,\" Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.", "source": {"uri": "nationalpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Post"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 1, "stanza_neu": 2, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 3, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7142545453", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-07", "time": "04:17:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-07T04:17:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-07T04:17:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4470588266849518, "url": "https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3545204-isw-explains-why-russian-forces-use-power-plants-as-nuclear-shield.html", "title": "  ISW explains why Russian forces use power plants as nuclear shield  ", "body": "The report was published on the ISW's website on August 6, Ukrinform reports.\n\n\"Russian forces are likely using the NPP to play on Western fears of a nuclear disaster in Ukraine in an effort to degrade Western will to provide military support to a Ukrainian counteroffensive, while also effectively using the plant as a nuclear shield to prevent Ukrainian strikes on Russian forces and equipment,\" the report reads.\n\nAs reported, on August 5, Russian troops fired twice at the Zaporizhzhia NPP.

This will be the destruction of the planet,\" Guterres said. \"What is clear is if nobody uses for the first time then there will be no nuclear war.\"\n\nFears of a third atomic bombing have been on the rise amid Russia's threats of a nuclear attack since its war on Ukraine began in February.\n\nOn Thursday, Moscow shelled the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, which holds Europe's largest nuclear plant. When asked about the attack, Guterres said, \"Any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing.\"\n\nHe said he fully supports the International Atomic Energy Agency in their effort to stabilize the plant and have access to the facility to exercise its mandate.\n\nGuterres said that after decades of nuclear disarmament efforts, the world is now \"moving backwards,\" noting that the world already has 13,000 nuclear bombs and huge investment going into modernization of atomic arsenals. \"So this is the time to say: Stop it.\"\n\nGuterres said that the billions of dollars being used in the arms race should be spent on other pressing issues.\n\n\"The billions that are being used in this arms race need to be used to fighting climate change, fighting poverty, addressing the needs of the international community,\" he said.\n\nHe said he will be also going to Mongolia and South Korea to discuss ways to address North Korea's nuclear development.\n\nAt a time when geopolitical tensions are rising and the nuclear threat is back in focus, Japan's strong and consistent voice on peace is more important than ever, Guterres said, urging Japan to use its unique position as the world's only country to have suffered atomic attacks to act as \"a bridge-builder and peacemaker to strengthen global cooperation and trust and solidarity.\"\n\nGuterres said he is counting on Japan's potential to take leadership on the global fight against climate change, and specifically urged Tokyo to stop funding coal plants.\n\nJapan, which has not clarified the timing when it will fully ban coal-fired plants, has been seen as reluctant to commit itself to banning coal power as soon as many European countries.\n\nCurrent efforts in Japan, the world's third-largest economy, are focused on developing methods to burn ammonia in conventional coal-fired plants and gradually phasing out use of coal possibly sometime in the 2040s. Japan also aims to promote the \"clean coal\" technology in Asia to achieve zero emissions.\n\nEnergy experts and critics say Japan currently has overly ambitious targets for nuclear energy to supply 20%-22% of its energy mix by 2030. By that time, the country has promised to cut emissions to 46% of 2013 levels.\n\n\"There is no such thing as clean coal,\" Guterres said. \"For a real change, I hope Japanese public and private capital will stop financing coal completely.\"\n\nGuterres said he expects Japan, through multilateral development banks, to \"immediately deliver investments and support for developing countries to expand renewables and build climate resilience\" to find solutions that fit their needs in addressing the climate emergency.\n\n\"I call for Japan to make the right choice -- for Japan and for the world,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/afd28b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3375+0+313/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2F15%2F9748fe7595a59449a811cdbbc673%2F01ee69b9694841d3ae62ecb55946053e", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 8, "stanza_neu": 16, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 25, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7143688870", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "08:57:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T08:57:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T08:57:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4235294163227081, "url": "https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2022/08/08/ukraine-Zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-shelling/6151659936565/", "title": "U.N. head calls for access to Ukraine's nuclear plant following attack", "body": "Aug. 8 (UPI) -- United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Monday called for international inspectors to be allowed access to Ukraine's besieged Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant after Kyiv officials said it was damaged in Russian shelling.\n\nDuring a trip to Japan to mark the 77th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the U.N. head told reporters that any attack on Europe's largest nuclear power plant is \"suicidal\" and that he hoped shelling would soon cease.\n\nAdvertisement", "source": {"uri": "upi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPI"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/6151659936565/2022/upi_com/9c930beceffc1ec7f1f8defd9322bb3e/v2.1/UN-head-calls-for-access-to-Ukraines-nuclear-plant-following-attack.jpg?lg=4", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 1, "stanza_neu": 2, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 3, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7145357144", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-09", "time": "14:45:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-09T14:45:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-09T14:13:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4196078479290009, "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/putin-captured-nuclear-reactors-141300047.html", "title": "What will Putin do with the captured nuclear reactors?", "body": "What will Putin do when it dawns on him that his scenarios aren't doable, that he, so great and terrible, will lose the war?\n\nAnd he will lose the war in Ukraine. After all, roughly speaking, Putin had hoped for a sort of Austrian Anschluss, with flowers, tears, and cheers from the \"Russian world's\" ecstatic supporters. The plan did not pan out anywhere in Ukraine.\n\nConscious of his failings and realizing the need to maintain power in Russia, what will Putin do? The nuclear topic is not a minor thing. The Russians keep putting it forward to talk about worldwide. And even when they reportedly deny the possibility of using tactical weapons, they make it clear they can actually do it if \"there's a threat to Russia.\"\n\nWhat is a threat to Russia? The very existence of Ukraine's statehood is being deemed a threat to Russia in the Kremlin's eyes. And there are calls to destroy it, as Dmitry Rogozin, formerly in charge of Roscosmos, recently did - to the general approval of the Russian political elite and Putin.\n\nDeclaring the occupied Ukrainian territories part of Russia - something Putin's regime is heading toward by preparing miserable, totally illegitimate \"referendums\" - should make Ukrainian resistance and de-occupation of these territories impossible in Moscow's mind. Now, it would be a threat to Russia's existence and an \"attack\" on \"its\" part (in fact, stolen from Ukraine). Moscow is also halting U.S. inspections of its nuclear weapons while continuing the act of terrorism in the south of Ukraine, where Russian troops have seized the Zaporizhzhya atomic power plant, the largest in Europe. This makes the nuclear package in Putin's arsenal quite significant.\n\nIs Putin ready to blow up a nuclear plant? Or will he keep the station hostage and use it to put pressure on the West so that the latter forces Ukrainians to capitulate, disarm, and walk in single file into an Olenivka like Russian concentration camp set up by the Putinists?\n\nThat is entirely in the spirit of Putin, who still thinks Ukrainians do not decide on or mean anything, while U.S. President Joe Biden can make them carry out a program of self-destruction for the sake of the rest of the planet or the part which Putin threatens to blow up and contaminate with radiation. Seizing a nuclear plant, destroying several energy transmission lines, and attempting to connect the plant to the Russian power grid have immensely increased the risks of a large-scale accident. What is absolutely certain is that Putin sincerely believes nuclear blackmail can be used to arm-wrestle the West into stopping military aid to Ukraine.\n\nI suggest we start thinking logically. Let's consider the worst-case scenario, when the West is scared and has begun to fulfill Putin's conditions in the same way one fulfills the demands of the terrorists seizing a passenger liner. So tell me, will Ukraine's catastrophe resolve the issue of nuclear safety under such a scenario? Or would it bring this same problem and danger closer to EU and NATO countries' borders?\n\nAfter all, Putin will have his hands not on one reactor but four (!). That means fifteen operating nuclear reactor with a total installed capacity of 13,835 MW plus the stopped Chornobyl NPPand spent nuclear fuel storage facilities. What considerable potential for strengthening the empire and nuclear blackmail of the West! You probably think the Russians would be stopped by border signs with countries' names on them and several thousand NATO soldiers stationed in the Baltic states. But where does this confidence of yours come from? Maybe it's just an honest belief in good things and childlike optimism.\n\nYet we must see the state of things without rose-coloured glasses. I think NATO is not ready for a war in Europe, or the Alliance might need time to prepare. Transferring howitzers piecemeal to Ukraine to deter such a powerful enemy can be explained not only by the reluctance to \"increase the degree of conflict\" but because, like the other weapons, the howitzers are worth their weight in gold in NATO countries themselves. They've been preparing for peace, not war, for years.\n\nDo you think Putin doesn't know this? Didn't he enjoy watching the political battles over theallies' attempt to reach the 2% defense spending guideline? Remember that the Russian dictator demanded that NATO \"roll back\" to its 1997 borders, i.e., by disarming (demilitarizing) countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, and others. Do you know what's going to happen after disarmament? \"Denazification\" and \"liberation\" the Russian way, with millions of refugees abandoning everything they owned: houses, apartments, cars, businesses, and jobs; just to save their lives.\n\nTherefore, the idea of ending support for Ukraine and giving up to Putin not only a considerable part of all the world's grain (which can be used to govern the planet's food balance and tools to blackmail with hunger) but also four more nuclear plants is not a good idea. Evil must be stopped and not allowed to increase, absorb, and digest everything in its path, including grain fields, captured territories, uranium mines, and nuclear plants.\n\nAnd if someone in the West thinks Putin won't ever do to them what he did to Ukrainians, I can only say one thing: you're being very naive.", "source": {"uri": "news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "eventUri": "eng-7930013", "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 29, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 42, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7144045949", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-08-08", "time": "14:13:00", "dateTime": "2022-08-08T14:13:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-08-08T12:50:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4156862795352936, "url": "https://www.newdelhitimes.com/tons-of-grain-leaving-ukraine/", "title": "Tons of Grain Leaving Ukraine   -    New Delhi Times   -   India Only International Newspaper", "body": "Four grain ships sailed from Ukraine's Black Sea ports Sunday.\n\nThe Joint Coordination Center, the body set up under the Black Sea Grain Initiative to monitor its implementation, authorized the departures through the maritime humanitarian corridor.\n\nThe ships moving out of Ukrainian ports are headed to China, Italy and two locations in Turkey.\n\nA fifth ship has been authorized to sail to Ukraine to pick up cargo.\n\nUkraine is one of the world's breadbaskets and the blockage of its ports has resulted in rising global food prices and the threat of famine.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in his daily address Saturday denounced Amnesty International for its \"eloquent silence\" in failing to address the Russian shelling of Zaporizhzhia NPP, the Ukrainian power plant that is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe.
