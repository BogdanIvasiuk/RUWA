While GlobalSecurity.org takes utmost care to accurately report this news story, we cannot independently verify the authenticity of all statements, photos and videos.\n\nOn 24 February 2022, Ukraine was suddenly and deliberately attacked by land, naval and air forces of Russia, igniting the largest European war since the Great Patriotic War. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" (SVO - spetsialnaya voennaya operatsiya) in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the \"Donbass republics\" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.\n\n\"To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.\" [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence reported that, over the last 24 hours, heavy fighting has taken place on three fronts: in the north, near Kharkiv; in the east in the Donbas; and in the south in Kherson Oblast. Russia's planned main effort is probably an advance on Bakhmut in the Donbas, but commanders face a dilemma of whether to deploy operational reserves to support this offensive, or to defend against continued Ukrainian advances in the south.\n\nMultiple concurrent threats spread across 500km will test Russia's ability to coordinate operational design and reallocate resources across multiple groupings of forces.\n\nEarlier in the war, Russia's failure to do this was one of the underlying reasons for the military's poor performance.\n\nThe General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that Russia continues to focus its efforts on establishing full control over the territory of Donetsk oblast, maintaining the captured districts of Kherson, part of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhya and Mykolaiv oblasts.

While GlobalSecurity.org takes utmost care to accurately report this news story, we cannot independently verify the authenticity of all statements, photos and videos.\n\nOn 24 February 2022, Ukraine was suddenly and deliberately attacked by land, naval and air forces of Russia, igniting the largest European war since the Great Patriotic War. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" (SVO - spetsialnaya voennaya operatsiya) in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the \"Donbass republics\" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.\n\n\"To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.\" [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]\n\nUkraine announced major advancements in a strategic military counteroffensive against Russian forces.

Lead elements have advanced up to 50km into previously Russian held territory on a narrow front.\n\nRussian forces were likely taken by surprise. The sector was only lightly held and Ukrainian units have captured or surrounded several towns. A Russian force around Izium is likely increasingly isolated. Ukrainian units are now threatening the town of Kupiansk; its capture would be a significant blow to Russia because it sits on supply routes to the Donbas front line.\n\nWith Ukrainian operations also continuing in Kherson, the Russian defensive front is under pressure on both its northern and southern flanks.\n\nThe General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that Russia continues to focus its efforts on establishing full control over the territory of the Donetsk oblast, maintaining the captured territories and disrupting the offensive of our troops in certain directions. Russian forces conduct aerial reconnaissance, continues to fire at the positions of Ukrainian units, takes measures to restore the lost position, and move troops for this purpose.

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" (SVO - spetsialnaya voennaya operatsiya) in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the \"Donbass republics\" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country.
