In 2015, the dictator launched the Akhmat MMA fight club, a state-sponsored combat sports facility that is home to many of Chechnya's top fighters, including several who compete in the UFC. The fight club is operated by Abuzayed Vismuradov, a life-long friend and ally to Kadyrov who emerged as one of the three most powerful men in Chechnya.\n\nChimaev, who emerged as Kadyrov's favorite fighter after earning back-to-back victories in the UFC in 2020, regularly visited the Akhmat MMA fight club for various public appearances, including training seminars for children and photo-ops with Kadyrov. He regularly donned the club's attire, which consisted of a T-shirt with the Akhmat MMA logo along with a picture of Ramzan Kadyrov's late father, Akhmad Kadyrov, the former president of Chechnya who was assassinated in 2004.\n\nWhile the Akhmat MMA Fight Club was placed under U.S. Treasury sanction in 2020 for bringing \"pride and profit\" to Kadyrov, Chimaev has continued to associate with the dictator and his fight club.

Chimaev visited the gym after his win over Gilbert Burns at UFC 273 in April, sparring with Kadyrov's teenage sons during a training session. Last January, Chimaev was gifted a Mercedes Benz by Kadyrov but the UFC star crashed it just three months later.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Khamzat Chimaev's friendship with Ramzan Kadyrov? Let us know in the comments section below\n\nChimaev's fighting career was almost over in 2020 after he broke promotional records for the fastest consecutive wins and quickest three-fight win streak in modern history. 'Borz' went through a long battle with Covid-19 he announced he was \"done\" with fighting, but Kadyrov seemingly pressured him to consider his decision and the following month Chimaev ended his retirement.\n\n\"Khamzat said that his recovery from the illness has been slow, and, in an attempt to be honest and frank with the fans, he decided not to give them hope. I told him that all Chechens were upset by this news. I reminded Chimaev that the youth, whom he inspires, are pinning their hopes and expectations on his success and if fans need to wait for his return, then we will all look forward to his return to the octagon with trepidation and patience,\" Kadyrov said.\n\nThe leader even sent a private plane to pick Chimaev up from Sweden and take him to Chechenya amid his health concerns. In May, Chimaev sparred with Kadyrov and seemingly allowed him to be ragdolled by the leader. Whilst voicing support for his \"motherland\", Chimaev also expressed his frustration for sport being mixed with politics in light of his relationship with Kadyrov.\n\nRead more", "source": {"uri": "msn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSN International Edition"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harry_davies@msn.com", "name": "Harry Davies", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA11F4YV.img?h=315&w=600&m=6&q=60&o=t&l=f&f=jpg&x=399&y=126", "eventUri": "eng-8015186", "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 5, "stanza_neu": 18, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 24, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7180648258", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-08", "time": "10:45:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-08T10:45:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-08T10:45:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7568627595901489, "url": "https://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/61246/", "title": "Kadyrov reports about sending fighters of elite military units to Ukraine", "body": "Fighters of the elite units, the \"Yug\" battalion and the \"Sever\" regiment, went to Ukraine, and many of them go there not for the first time, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov reports.\n\nThe \"Caucasian Knot\" has reported that on September 6, Ramzan Kadyrov announced that \"several thousand more determined volunteers and elite fighters\" were preparing to be sent to the special military operation zone.

On the southern side, Georgia has had its qualms with its northern neighbor. On the northern side, the multitude of regions still clash with the Russian Federation, despite being subjects to the Kremlin.\n\nChechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia, and North Ossetia-Alania comprise only a part of the more tumultuous areas Russia has attempted, and arguably still does attempt, to subjugate. This region's most famous figure is the head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov. The boisterous and domineering leader leads a multifaceted life, one he has not been shy to put on display on social media.\n\nDespite flaunting exotic cars, an opulent lifestyle, and lavish parties complete with Western celebrity visits, his family and people's roots come from centuries of anti-Russian sentiment. While Kadyrov also promulgates an image of devout conservatism and a commitment to Islam, he also broadcasts a strong man persona. Images abound of him with rifles and machine guns, armored cars, and selfies with members of his elite personal guard clad in the latest military kit.\n\nIn a recent video, the leader of Chechnya said he would be taking a \"long and indefinite vacation\" due to his lengthy time in public service. Shortly after this, he posted a reply saying that not only was it not appropriate to take personal time, but that all his followers should be committed to the cause in Ukraine.\n\nWhile referring to Ukraine and her Western supporters as \"global satanism,\" he claims \"several thousand more determined volunteers and elite fighters are preparing to be sent to help the advancing allied forces.\"\n\nKadyrov is best known in Western military expert and analyst circles as one who often uses his widely followed social media presence as a form of information warfare. This latest stunt is likely a move to cultivate support and draw attention. Since the region has had its history of being a problem for Moscow, it is Kadyrov who is responsible for any dissent.\n\nAnother recent video released shows the dissent that could be brewing on the northern side of the Greater Caucasus Mountains. A Chechen anti-Russian movement has reportedly begun in the region. A video shows several members, clad in combat gear and brandishing Kalashnikov-series rifles, set fire to a Russian flag while holding up the flag of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.\n\nIn their video, they declare war on Kaydrov's \"godless regime\" and call on all people to rise up against his pro-Putin government. In addition to saying that they have the means, arms, and people to support this movement, they say that much of Kadyrov's proverbial dirty laundry will be aired \"soon.\" While claims like this are made almost routinely in this contentious region, this is the largest and most credible in recent years. \"Kadyrov, the time that you were afraid of has come. Freedom to Ichkeria!,\" the group exclaims while concluding their video.\n\nThis shadowy group, calling themselves the \"Sons of Ichkeria,\" is not totally alone. The video has been released with narration and follow-on videos from Islam Belokiyev. Belokiyev is the spokesman for the Sheikh Mansur Battalion, a much better known unit of Chechens fighting in the Ukrainian Armed Forces against Russia, mostly in the eastern Donbas region.\n\nWhile no direct connection between the Sons of Ichkeria and the military authorities in Kyiv has been established, the two share a similar identity. According to Belokiyev, they have been \"conducting military training, the purpose of which is the de-occupation, decolonization, and subsequent denuclearization of the Russian Empire.\" Additionally, he says, now is the time to strike at Russia, calling them weak and vulnerable.\n\n\"Right now, Russia is very weak and has stretched its forces ... so we are closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine with the aim of rocking the Caucasian front. We will act when and where we want to,\" he claims in his statement. Elaborating, Belokiyev says the militant group in the North Caucasus is preparing arms, organizing assault groups, and preparing for the operation they have called \"Lightning in the Mountains.\"\n\nThis development gives context for Kadyrov's series of videos. As a propaganda move to motivate people to feel more sympathetic to the leader and rekindle their fervor against the opposition, it works as a galvanization of his power. This power is in a region that Moscow knows is held because Kadyrov is on the Kremlin's payroll, a number some say is in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nAs a result of this leverage, it's highly likely that Kadyrov knows he has this over the head of Vladimir Putin. Not wanting any military divergences from their \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, Putin is unlikely to act too rashly with Kadyrov. The Chechen leader will be free to act as he pleases, and if a popular front arises in his region, use the brutal repression techniques he is infamous for upon the Sons of Ichkeria.\n\nThis immense potential for instability in the North Caucasus puts Georgia in a peculiar position. While being involved isn't a notion, preventing the spill-over of hostilities and violence is paramount. Tbilisi and the nation's security forces will need to reckon with the potential of not only militants using the remote mountain regions as a resupply area and safe route to travel, but also a potential source of recruits.\n\nSimilar to the past issues with militant elements in the northeast of the country, Georgia's counterterror and police units should exercise area denial operations ahead of any potential outbreak of hostilities. The North Caucasus, while a geo-ethnic partner to the nation, is also a potential powder keg and southern front as popular support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine diminishes.", "source": {"uri": "georgiatoday.ge", "dataType": "news", "title": "Georgia Today on the Web"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://georgiatoday.ge/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trouble-in-the-Neighborhood-2.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-8015186", "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 7, "stanza_neu": 33, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 43, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7184008808", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-11", "time": "10:13:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-11T10:13:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-11T09:58:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "url": "https://meduza.io/en/news/2022/09/11/chechen-ruler-criticizes-russian-military-for-retreating-from-occupied-cities-in-ukraine-explain-yourselves", "title": "Chechen ruler criticizes Russian military for retreating from occupied cities in Ukraine.

The military has made some \"mistakes,\" Kadyrov said, expressing hope that \"they will draw the necessary conclusions.\"\n\n\"The Ministry of Defense clarified the situation, because of which they left the towns of Izyum, Kupyansk, Balakleya in the Kharkov area.

According to a report by the AFP, Ukrainian forces said that their counter-attack drove away Russian soldiers who fled hastily abandoning their posts.\n\nOver the weekend, Ukrainian forces said they thwarted Russian forces in the cities of Izyum, Kupiansk and Balakliya. Russia also fired back and Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky alleged that out of fear Russia chose to attack Ukrainian infrastructure forcing residents in Kharkiv and nearby cities to live without electricity and water.\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive sowed seeds of discontent and dissent among the Russian army. According to a report by the Guardian, Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, who was appointed by Russian president Vladimir Putin, criticised the Russian leadership.\n\nKadyrov was unhappy with Vladimir Putin because over the weekend the Russian president presided over an event where a huge observation wheel was inaugurated in Moscow as part of celebrations for Moscow Day.\n\n\"They have made mistakes and I think they will draw the necessary conclusions. If today or tomorrow no changes in strategy are made, I will be forced to speak with the leadership of the defence ministry and the leadership of the country to explain the real situation on the ground to them,\" the Guardian quoted Kadyrov as saying, citing an audio message posted to his Telegram channel on Sunday.\n\nKadyrov was not the only one, there were other pro-war Russian commentators who felt that the celebrations were a bit over the top at a time when Russian forces were suffering losses in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"The fireworks in Moscow on a tragic day of Russia's military defeat will have extremely serious political consequences. Authorities mustn't celebrate when people are mourning,\" Russian political analyst Sergei Markov said criticizing Putin.\n\nThe Russian Defence Ministry was quick to jump to its own defence. It said that the retreat of its forces from Izyum and other areas was done with the aim of replenishing and strengthening its forces.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Russia gave a similar explanation earlier this year during its troop pullback from Kyiv.\n\nKadyrov is a hyper loyalist but his messaging is not controlled by the Kremlin. He was once a rebel and Chechen rebels in the past decades have troubled the Kremlin.

The Chechen star had faced criticism for his actions prior to the opening bell having been booed by fans after grinning despite threatening to derail the event with his 7.5lb miss of weight.\n\nHe has also caused controversy outside of the ring due to his relationship with Chechen warlord Kadyrov, who has been accused of leading anti-gay purges and restricting the lives of women in the republic.

I reminded Chimaev that the youth, whom he inspires, are pinning their hopes and expectations on his success and if fans need to wait for his return, then we will all look forward to his return to the octagon with trepidation and patience.\"\n\nChimaev has expressed his frustration at politics being mixed with sport as there remains close examination of his friendship with Kadyrov and has voiced his support for the \"motherland\". The Chechen star now finds himself another step further in his UFC career and will be eyeing a shot at the title next which is currently held by Leon Edwards.\n\nDuring his post-fight speech, Chimaev saluted his hometown Chechenya and vowed to \"kill\" everybody. \"Hey, so what now, say something,\" he said after the final bell. This is Chechnya motherf******. I'm the most dangerous guy here, I've got guns for everyone, I'll kill everybody.\"\n\n\"I don't care about that s***, I'd kill that guy, I'll go through everybody.
