Yet methane has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere. And even though CO2\u202fhas a longer-lasting effect, at least 25 per cent of today's global warming is driven by methane from human actions. Startup Orbio Earth is working to increase awareness and action on methane emissions with a platform that provides actionable methane intelligence.\n\nOrbio Earth uses satellite data and its own proprietary algorithms to provide organisations with accurate and actionable methane intelligence. This can then be used to develop emission reduction plans and benchmarking efforts. Orbio utilises satellites to capture images of methane emissions every four days from any site on earth. The satellite emissions data is then cross-analysed with additional datasets to generate insights around how individual organisations can diagnose and reduce their emission events over time.\n\nUsing Orbio's platform, organisations can then focus on reduction opportunities, and make more transparent buying and supply chain decisions. The platform provides features that allow organisations to better understand the emissions profile of an asset, supply chain, partner company, and/or region.\n\nBy offering data aimed at decision-making, Orbio hopes to aid methane-emitting industries like waste and agriculture to reduce their methane emissions by 10 million metric tons by 2030. Robert Huppertz, CEO & Co-Founder of Orbio Earth said that, \"Although there is no silver bullet in the fight against climate change, we believe that the global deployment of ground-breaking technologies like satellite-based methane monitoring, can move the needle on climate action while solving real world customer problems ...\"\n\nAlthough the fight against methane is just ramping up, Springwise has already seen a number of innovations aimed at stemming emissions.

It is also the equivalent of one third of Denmark's total annual greenhouse gas emissions, a Danish official warned Wednesday.\n\n\"Whoever ordered this should be prosecuted for war crimes and go to jail,\" said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist. Two scientists looked at the official worst case scenario estimates provided by the Danish government -- 778 million cubic meters of gas -- for The Associated Press. Jackson and David Hastings, a retired chemical oceanographer in Gainesville, Florida each calculated that would be an equivalent of roughly half a million metric tons of methane. The Aliso Canyon disaster released 90-100,000 metric tons.\n\nAndrew Baxter, a chemical engineer who formerly worked in the offshore oil and gas industry, and is now at the environmental group EDF thought the Danish estimate was likely too high. He had a more conservative estimate. But it was still more than double the Aliso Canyon disaster.\n\n\"That's one thing that is consistent with these estimates,\" he said, \"It's catastrophic for the climate.\"\n\nKristoffer B\u00f6ttzauw, head of the Danish Energy Agency, said emissions from the three leaks on the underwater Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines correspond to approximately 32% of annual Danish carbon dioxide emissions. Danish emissions in 2020 were approximately 45 million tonnes of CO2.\n\nSabotage was suspected to have caused the leaks, and seismologists said Tuesday that explosions rattled the Baltic Sea before they were discovered. Some European officials and energy experts have said Russia is likely to blame since it directly benefits from higher energy prices and economic anxiety across Europe. But others cautioned against pointing fingers until investigators are able to determine what happened.\n\nMethane seen bubbling at the ocean surface was an indication of \"a strong upward flow,\" according to Paul Balcombe, a member of the engineering faculty at the department of chemical engineering at Imperial College London.\n\nThe loss of pressure in the pipe likely meant a large amount of gas was already lost, he said. The impacts of the gas leak are still coming into focus, Balcombe said, but are likely to be significant.\n\n\"It would have a very large environmental and climate impact indeed, even if it released a fraction of this,\" he said.\n\nMethane is a major contributor to climate change, responsible for a significant share of the climate disruption people are already experiencing. That is because it is 82.5 times more potent than carbon dioxide at absorbing the sun's heat and warming the Earth.\n\nB\u00f6ttzauw, told a press conference that the agency expects the gas to be out of the pipes, that run from Russia to Germany, by Sunday.\n\n\"We believe that half the gas is out by now of one of the two pipes,\" B\u00f6ttzauw said. \"We are talking about a huge spill of several million cubic meters of gas.\"\n\nThe Danish agency statement added that its calculation was based on information from operators Nord Stream AG and Nord Stream 2 AG about the content of natural gas in the three pipelines that are leaking.\n\nThe incidents come as the EU struggles to keep a lid on soaring gas and electricity prices.\n\n\"As long as there is gas, it dangerous to be there,\" B\u00f6ttzauw said, declining to say when experts would be able to go down and see the pipes, which he said was made of 12-centimeter (5-inch) thick steel coated with concrete. They lie on the seabed between 70 and 90 meters (230 feet and 295 feet) deep.\n\nThe leaks all were in international waters.

It builds on Canada's existing progress and commitments, including the 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan.\n\nFrom being the first country to establish national oil and gas methane reduction regulations to investing in our world-class science and clean tech sector, and helping other countries reduce their methane emissions, the Strategy announced today will position Canada to continue leading in reducing methane emissions domestically and driving ambitious reductions internationally.\n\nWith the measures outlined in the Strategy, Canada will reduce domestic methane emissions by more than 35 percent by 2030, compared to 2020 levels. This will exceed the Global Methane Pledge target of 30 percent that Canada signed on to last year.\n\nThe Methane Strategy outlines how Canada will:\n\nLowering methane emissions can also have positive impacts on air quality and public health. In particular, methane contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone that causes serious health problems such as reduced lung function and asthma attacks, and is responsible for half a million premature deaths globally.\n\nThe Government of Canada will continue to work closely with and support ongoing complementary action by provinces, territories, municipalities, Indigenous groups, industry sectors, and others to reduce methane emissions across the country.

"Nord Stream gas leaks may be a new disaster for the climate", "body": "The 700-metre wide pool of bubbling water in the Baltic Sea caused by the rupture of the Nord Stream gas pipelines points to a climate disaster.\n\nIt's the most visible of three major gas leaks emanating from the pipelines connecting Russia to Germany.\n\nScientists are scrambling to work out just how much methane, one of the most powerful greenhouse gases, has escaped into the atmosphere.\n\nThe fear is that it could be one of the worst releases ever.\n\n* European leaders blame Russian 'sabotage' after Nord Stream explosions\n\n* Powerful explosions that caused pipeline leaks under Baltic Sea were 'not an earthquake'; Russian sabotage suspected\n\n* How Putin could have carried out Nord Stream attack - and it may have been set up months ago\n\nThe cause of the three near-simultaneous pipeline ruptures hasn't been confirmed, but German and US officials said the incident looked like sabotage.\n\nWhile the Nord Stream 1 pipelines were halted - and Nordstream 2 had never even started - they all contained pressurised natural gas, the vast majority of which is methane.\n\n\"Given that, over 20 years, a ton of methane has a climate impact more than 80 times that of CO2, the potential for a massive and highly damaging emission event is very worrisome,\" said David McCabe, senior scientist at Clean Air Task Force, a climate non-profit. \"There are a number of uncertainties but, if these pipelines fail, the impact to the climate will be disastrous and could even be unprecedented.\"\n\nEstimating the precise amount of methane that has escaped into the atmosphere is an extremely challenging task. Many so-called super-emitting events - large continuous discharges of methane - are captured by satellite imagery over land-based pipelines or fossil-fuel production sites. But capturing accurate data over water, is far more challenging given the light that reflects of the surface.\n\nThere are a number of other key uncertainties - how much gas was in the pipelines at the time, what temperature and pressure it was being held at, and just how big the size of the rupture in the pipes was. Even when the gas escapes, some is likely to have dissipated into the water, but that also depends on the density of microbial life, as well as the depth. To obtain accurate readings, a plane would probably have to take measurements from the air.\n\nDespite that, scientists on social media were quick to do some back-of-the envelope calculations into just how much methane might have escaped. Andrew Baxter, director of energy strategy at the Environmental Defence Fund, estimated that around 115,000 metric tons of methane escaped, equivalent to around 9.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. In real terms, that's the same climate impact as the emissions from 2 million gasoline cars over the course of a year, or two-and-a-half coal-fired power stations.\n\nGreenpeace's European Union unit put the figure even higher - potentially as much as 30 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. If those estimates are close to being accurate, it would be one of the biggest methane leaks ever. The largest known release in the US, happened at gas storage facility in Aliso Canyon, Los Angeles, in 2015, where an estimated 97,100 metric tons of methane was emitted over several months. By comparison, the Nord Stream leaks may have happened over the course of several hours.\n\nGHGSat, a satellite emissions monitoring company, said that the breaches of the Nord Stream pipelines may have resulted in 500 metric tons of methane escaping per hour - 10 times more than the Aliso leak at its peak.\n\nOther scientists said that while the Nord Stream leaks were a disaster for the climate, they still pale in comparison to daily discharges from gas infrastructure globally, where around a tenth of the fossil fuel's supply is leaked into the atmosphere, according to Piers Forster, a professor of climate physics from the University of Leeds in the UK.\n\n\"The most direct effect of these gas leaks on climate is the extra dollop of the powerful greenhouse gas methane,\" said Dave Reay, executive director of Edinburgh Climate Change Institute. \"That said, this is a wee bubble in the ocean compared to the huge amounts of so-called 'fugitive methane' that are emitted every day around the world due to things like fracking, coal mining and oil extraction.\"\n\nWhile methane leaks are harmful to the climate, they do not pose a significant threat to the marine environment, the German Environment Ministry said in response to a request for comment, highlighting previous cases where the gas was discharged due to drilling in the North Sea. It added that they were exchanging information with experts from Denmark and Sweden.\n\nThe expulsion of methane, comes amid growing public consciousness of its effects on the climate. At the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, over 100 countries pledged to drastically curb emissions. The EU is also in the process of legislation that would raise the obligation on companies to reduce flaring of the gas, conduct regular inspections to stem leaks and boost transparency of leaks associated with imports.\n\nAt an event in the European Parliament on Tuesday evening to launch \"methane week\", lawmakers, scientists and environmentalists discussed how to measure the scale of the leak, but were united on one thing - it is likely to be an environmental disaster.\n\nThe Green group's co-lead negotiator for the bloc's methane regulation, Jutta Paulus, pointed the finger firmly toward Russia, coming the same week as the Baltic Pipeline - connecting Norway to Poland - was opened.\n\n\"'I don't think it's a coincidence that this is happened on the day the Baltic pipeline was opened,\" Paulus said at the event.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin is telling us \"be sure you know what you're doing when you're applying more sanctions on us.

Scientists say sharp cuts in methane emissions over the next few years will be a vital lever in curbing climate change.\n\nHARD TO QUANTIFY\n\nJasmin Cooper, a research associate at Imperial College London's Sustainable Gas Institute, said it would be difficult to quantify exactly how much gas was reaching the atmosphere - especially given scarce existing data on leaks from subsea pipelines.\n\n\"Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) will probably have an estimate based on gas throughputs, but in terms of how much gas/methane is emitted into the atmosphere ... they need to send out a team now to measure and monitor,\" she said, referring to the state-owned Russian gas firm.\n\nMethane leaks from onshore gas leaks can be picked up by a growing network of special satellites, but due to the different reflection of light on water it is challenging to use satellites to analyse offshore leaks, said Christian Lelong, director for climate solutions at satellite data firm Kayrros.\n\nFlyovers with planes or drones could be alternative solutions, analysts said.\n\nA \"conservative estimate\" based on available data suggests the leaks together were releasing more than 500 metric tons of methane per hour when first breached, with the pressure and flow rate decreasing over time, said Jean-Francois Gauthier, vice president of measurements at the commercial methane-measuring satellite firm GHGSat.\n\nBy comparison, the huge Aliso Canyon gas leak in the United States in 2016 spewed around 50 tons of methane per hour at its peak. \"So this would be an order of magnitude more,\" Gauthier said.\n\nA spokesman for Nord Stream 2 - one of the leaking pipelines, which never started operating and was shelved by Germany just before Russia invaded Ukraine - said this week the system held 300 million cubic metres of gas.\n\nReleasing that amount in entirety to the atmosphere would result in around 200,000 tonnes of methane emissions, said chemical engineer Paul Balcombe at London's Queen Mary University.\n\nGerman non-profit Deutsche Umwelthilfe gave a similar estimate of the pipeline's potential emissions.\n\nThat amount of methane would have about the same global warming potential over a 100-year timeframe as about 6 million tons of carbon dioxide, according to Reuters calculations based on IPCC conversion factors. That's roughly on par with the amount of CO2 emitted in an entire year by mid-sized cities such as Havana, or Helsinki or Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThe amount of gas leaking from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline system is less clear, with a pipeline spokesman declining to say how much was left in the system when it was taken offline for maintenance a few weeks ago.\n\nStefano Grassi, head of the European Union energy commissioner's cabinet, said Tuesday that the leaks risked becoming \"a climate and ecological disaster\".\n\n\"We are in contact with [EU member states] to look into what happened and find the fastest way to stop leaks and avoid worse damage,\" Grassi said in a tweet.\n\nEU countries were among more than 100 countries, including the United States, Brazil, Pakistan and Mexico that pledged last year to slash their combined methane emissions by 30% by 2030, in a bid to help stave off disastrous levels of climate change.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL RISK\n\nWhile oil spills can immediately affect and ultimately kill wildlife, authorities say the gas pipeline gas leaks pose a limited threat to the surrounding plant and animal life.\n\nThe German environment ministry said the leaks would not pose a significant threat to marine life, but Greenpeace raised concerns on Tuesday that fish may get caught in plumes of gas, which could interfere with their breathing.\n\nDenmark's Energy Agency told Reuters said it was too early to say who would investigate the Nord Stream 2 leak and no-one has been to look at the pipeline yet.\n\nIt added the leaks will likely continue for several days and perhaps even a week.\n\nSource: Reuters", "source": {"uri": "hellenicshippingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hellenic Shipping News"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 19, "stanza_neu": 11, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 30, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7205797302", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-29", "time": "00:34:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-29T00:34:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-29T00:25:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7843137383460999, "url": "https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-estimate-the-scale-of-the-nord-stream-pipelines-methane-leak", "title": "Experts Estimate The Scale of The Nord Stream Pipelines Methane Leak", "body": "Planet-heating methane spewing into the atmosphere from the damaged Nord Stream pipelines only has a modest impact on climate change, say scientists, but sharply highlights the risks of fossil-fuel-driven greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe European Union has said it believes the leaks to the strategically important pipelines, Nord Stream 1 and 2, were caused by a \"deliberate act\".\n\nWhile not in operation the pipelines still contained gas, and Danish authorities said they will now likely continue to empty out, with leaks expected to continue for at least a week.\n\nWith only rough estimates available as to how much natural gas might bubble up through the Baltic Sea, scientists expressed concerns about climate and environmental impacts - but stressed that the amounts of methane involved were a tiny fraction of global emissions.\n\n\"It is a real travesty, an environmental crime if it was deliberate,\" said Jeffrey Kargel, senior scientist at the Planetary Research Institute in Arizona, calling the leak \"disturbing\".\n\nBut he added: \"Although the amount of gas lost from the pipeline obviously is large, it is not the climate disaster one might think.\"\n\nNatural gas is composed primarily of methane.\n\nThis is about 28 times more powerful than carbon dioxide on a century-long timescale - although it only lingers in the atmosphere for about a decade, compared to hundreds or thousands of years for CO.\n\nSome of the methane emitted from the pipes will be oxidized in the water into CO, said Grant Allen, professor of Atmospheric Physics at the University of Manchester.\n\n\"But given how violent the venting of natural gas appears to be, most of the gas will reach the sea surface as methane,\" he said.\n\nMethane is responsible for roughly 30 percent of the global rise in temperatures to date, even though it is far less abundant in the atmosphere than CO.\n\nThis is the subject of much uncertainty, although some experts and organizations have attempted to calculate the potential amount of gas in the pipelines.\n\nOne estimate is that there was up to 177 million cubic meters of natural gas still in Nord Stream 2, said Allen.\n\n\"This is not a small amount of gas, and represents a reckless emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,\" he said, adding it was equivalent to the natural gas used by 124,000 UK homes in a year.\n\nGreenpeace has used similar figures to roughly estimate that the leak emissions could be equivalent to eight months of Denmark's total greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nPaul Balcombe, an honorary lecturer at the Department of Chemical Engineering at Imperial College London, said estimates for the gas in the pipes range from around 150 to 300 million cubic meters.\n\n\"It is unlikely that they will release all their contents,\" he told the Science Media Center.\n\nBut he added if just one of the pipes did completely empty out it would be about twice as much as the worst methane leak recorded in the United States, the 2015 Aliso Canyon leak.\n\n\"It would have a very large environmental and climate impact indeed, even if it released a fraction of this,\" he said.\n\nLauri Myllyvirta from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air said he has calculated an estimated potential leak of between 180 and 270 kilotons from the two pipelines.\n\nThis figure is significant but, he said, is probably only 1.5 percent of the total annual methane emissions from oil and gas operations in Russia.\n\nThe International Energy Agency estimates this was some 18 million tons in 2021.\n\nThe IEA has decried the enormous amount of methane that leaks from fossil fuel operations every year - estimating the amount lost last year globally was broadly similar to all the gas used in Europe's power sector.\n\nThe leak will certainly have a \"strong immediate warming effect and cause poor air quality\" Piers Forster, director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate at the University of Leeds.\n\nBut ultimately its effect is small compared to the daily leaks from the world's poorly-maintained gas networks, which see around 10 percent of global gas supply lost.\n\nExperts said the incident further underscores the need to urgently switch from polluting fossil fuels, both to combat climate change and ensure energy security.\n\nThis year's energy crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine has already \"supercharged the clean energy transition\", Myllyvirta said.\n\nKargel, who calculated that the Nord Stream leak was roughly equivalent to 2.5 hours of global emissions, said it was a reminder of the urgent need to slash greenhouse emissions.\n\n\"The global climate is changing drastically, with huge impacts on extreme climate mounting every year, decade after decade,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "sciencealert.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScienceAlert"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@sciencealert.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/09/NordStream1GasPipelineMethaneLeakBalticSea.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 9, "stanza_neu": 19, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 29, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7206954851", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-29", "time": "19:20:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-29T19:20:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-29T19:02:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7843137383460999, "url": "https://grist.org/accountability/nord-stream-gas-leaks-may-be-biggest-ever-with-warning-of-large-climate-risk/", "title": "Nord Stream gas leaks may be biggest ever, with warning of 'large climate risk'", "body": "Scientists fear methane erupting from the burst Nord Stream pipelines into the Baltic Sea could be one of the worst natural gas leaks ever and pose significant climate risks.\n\nNeither of the two breached Nord Stream pipelines, which run between Russia and Germany, was operational, but both contained natural gas. This mostly consists of methane -- a greenhouse gas that is the biggest cause of climate heating after carbon dioxide.\n\nThe extent of the leaks is still unclear but rough estimates by scientists, based on the volume of gas reportedly in one of the pipelines, vary between 100,000 and 350,000 tons of methane.\n\nJasmin Cooper, a research associate at Imperial College London's department of chemical engineering, said a \"lot of uncertainty\" surrounded the leak.\n\n\"We know there are three explosions but we don't know if there are three holes in the sides of the pipe or how big the breaks are,\" said Cooper. \"It's difficult to know how much is reaching the surface. But it is potentially hundreds of thousands of tons of methane: quite a big volume being pumped into the atmosphere.\"\n\nNord Stream 2, which was intended to increase the flow of gas from Russia to Germany, reportedly contained 300 million cubic meters of gas when Berlin halted the certification process shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nThat volume alone would translate to 200,000 tons of methane, Cooper said. If it all escaped, it would exceed the 100,000 tons of methane vented by the Aliso Canyon blowout, the biggest gas leak in U.S. history, which happened in California in 2015. Aliso had the warming equivalent of half a million cars.\n\n\"It has the potential to be one of the biggest gas leaks,\" said Cooper. \"The climate risks from the methane leak are quite large. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, 30 times stronger than CO2 over 100 years and more than 80 times stronger over 20 years.\n\nProfessor Grant Allen, an expert in Earth and environmental science at Manchester University, said it was unlikely that natural processes, which convert small amounts of methane into carbon dioxide, would be able to absorb much of the leak.\n\n\"This is a colossal amount of gas, in really large bubbles. If you have small sources of gas, nature will help out by digesting the gas. In the Deepwater Horizon spill, there was a lot of attenuation of methane by bacteria,\" Allen said.\n\n\"My scientific experience is telling me that -- with a big blow-up like this -- methane will not have time to be attenuated by nature. So a significant proportion will be vented as methane gas.\"\n\nUnlike oil spill, gas will not have as polluting an effect on the marine environment, Allen said.\n\n\"But in terms of greenhouse gasses, it's a reckless and unnecessary emission to the atmosphere.\"\n\nGermany's environment agency said there were no containment mechanisms on the pipeline, so the entire contents were likely to escape.\n\nThe Danish Energy Agency said on Wednesday that the pipelines contained 778 million cubic meters of natural gas in total -- the equivalent of 32 percent of Danish annual CO2 emissions.\n\nThis is almost twice the volume initially estimated by scientists. This would significantly bump up estimates of methane leaked to the atmosphere, from 200,000 to more than 400,000 tons. More than half the gas had left the pipes and the remainder is expected be gone by Sunday, the agency said.\n\nJean-Francois Gauthier, vice-president of measurements at the commercial methane-measuring satellite firm GHGSat, said evaluating the total gas volume emitted was \"challenging\".\n\n\"There is little information on the size of the breach and whether it is still going on\" Gauthier said. \"If it's a significant enough breach, it would empty itself.\n\n\"It's safe to say that we're talking about hundreds of thousands of tons of methane. In terms of leaks, it's certainly a very serious one.

Only one of the Nord Stream 2 lines was struck. It was not in operation but was filled with 177 million cubic meters of gas last year.\n\nEstimates of the total gas in the pipelines that are leaking range from 150 million cubic meters to 500 million cubic meters. The middle range of those estimates indicates a leak of around 200,000 tons of methane, according to Paul Balcombe, a lecturer in chemical engineering at Imperial College London.\n\nKristoffer B\u00f6ttzauw, the director of the Danish Energy Agency, told reporters on Wednesday that the leaks would equate to about 14 million tons of CO2, about 32 percent of Denmark's annual emissions.\n\nGermany's Federal Environment Agency estimated the leaks will lead to emissions of around 7.5 million tons of CO2 equivalent -- about 1 percent of Germany's annual emissions. The agency also noted there are no \"sealing mechanisms\" along the pipelines, \"so in all likelihood the entire contents of the pipes will escape.\"\n\nBecause at least one of the leaks is in Danish waters, Denmark will have to add these emissions to its climate balance sheet, the agency said.\n\nBut it is not clear whether all of the gas in the lines would actually be released into the atmosphere. Methane is also consumed by ocean bacteria as it heads through the water column.\n\nThe largest leak ever recorded in the U.S. was the 2015 Aliso Canyon leak of roughly 90,000 tons of methane over months. With the upper estimates of what might be released in the Baltic more than twice that, this week's disaster may be \"unprecedented,\" said David McCabe, a senior scientist with the Clean Air Task Force.\n\nJeffrey Kargel, a senior scientist at the Planetary Research Institute in Tucson, Arizona, said the leak was \"really disturbing.

But \"it is not the climate disaster one might think.\"\n\nAnnual global carbon emissions are around 32 billion tons, so this represents a tiny fraction of the pollution driving climate change. It even pales in comparison to the accumulation of thousands of industrial and agricultural sources of methane that are warming the planet.\n\n\"This is a wee bubble in the ocean compared to the huge amounts of so-called fugitive methane that are emitted every day around the world due to things like fracking, coal mining and oil extraction,\" said Dave Reay, executive director of the Edinburgh Climate Change Institute.\n\nLauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said it was roughly comparable to the amount of methane leaked from across Russia's oil and gas infrastructure on any given working week.\n\nWhile the gas is still leaking, the immediate vicinity is an extremely dangerous place. Air that contains more than 5 percent methane can be flammable, said Rehder, so the risk of an explosion is real. Methane is not a toxic gas, but high concentrations can reduce the amount of available oxygen.\n\nShipping has been restricted from a 5 nautical mile radius around the leaks. This is because the methane in the water can affect buoyancy and rupture a vessel's hull.\n\nMarine animals near the escaping gas may be caught up and killed -- especially poor swimmers such as jellyfish, said Rehder. But long-term effects on the local environment are not anticipated.\n\n\"It's an unprecedented case,\" he said. \"But from our current understanding, I would think that the local effects on marine life in the area is rather small.\"\n\nSome have suggested that the remaining gas should be pumped out, but a German economy and climate ministry spokesperson on Wednesday said this wasn't possible.\n\nOnce the pipeline has emptied, \"it will fill up with water,\" the spokesperson added. \"At the moment, no one can go underwater -- the danger is too great due to the escaping methane.\"\n\nAny repair would be the responsibility of pipeline owner Nord Stream AG, the Germans said.\n\nNot only would it look impressive, setting the gas on fire would hugely slash the global warming impact of the leak. Methane is made of carbon and hydrogen, when burned it creates carbon dioxide, which is between 30 and 80 times less planet-warming per ton than methane. Flaring, as it is known, is a common method for reducing the impact of escaping methane.\n\nFrom a pure climate perspective, setting the escaping methane on fire makes sense. \"Yes, definitely -- it will help,\" said Piers Forster, director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate at the University of Leeds.\n\nBut there would be safety issues and potential environmental concerns, including air pollution from the combustion. \"With land -- in particular the inhabited and touristic island of Bornholm -- nearby, you would not venture into this,\" said Rehder.\n\nNo government has yet indicated that this is under consideration.\n\n\"We expect that gas will flow out of the pipes until the end of the week. After that, first of all, from the Danish side, we will try to get out and investigate what the cause is, and approach the pipes, so that we can have it investigated properly. We can do that when the gas leak has stopped,\" Danish Energy Agency director B\u00f6ttzauw told local media.", "source": {"uri": "politico.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/28/GettyImages-1231058121-scaled.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 22, "stanza_neu": 31, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 53, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7205765354", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-28", "time": "23:39:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-28T23:39:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-28T23:39:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7803921699523926, "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nord-stream-pipeline-record-leak-methane-baltic-seas-potent-greenhouse-gas/", "title": "Record methane leak flows from damaged Baltic Sea pipelines: \"It's catastrophic for the climate\"", "body": "Methane leaking from the damaged Nord Stream pipelines is likely to be the biggest burst of the potent greenhouse gas on record, by far.\n\nThe Nord Stream pipeline leaks that were pumping huge volumes of methane into the Baltic Sea and atmosphere could discharge as much as five times as much of the potent greenhouse as was released by the Aliso Canyon disaster, the largest known terrestrial release of methane in U.S. history. It is also the equivalent of one third of Denmark's total annual greenhouse gas emissions, a Danish official warned Wednesday.\n\n\"Whoever ordered this should be prosecuted for war crimes and go to jail,\" said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist. Two scientists looked at the official worst case scenario estimates provided by the Danish government -- 778 million cubic meters of gas -- for The Associated Press. Jackson and David Hastings, a retired chemical oceanographer in Gainesville, Florida each calculated that would be an equivalent of roughly half a million metric tons of methane. The Aliso Canyon disaster released 90-100,000 metric tons.\n\nAndrew Baxter, a chemical engineer who formerly worked in the offshore oil and gas industry, and is now at the environmental group EDF thought the Danish estimate was likely too high. He had a more conservative estimate. But it was still more than double the Aliso Canyon disaster.\n\n\"That's one thing that is consistent with these estimates,\" he said. \"It's catastrophic for the climate.\"\n\nKristoffer B\u00f6ttzauw, head of the Danish Energy Agency, said emissions from the three leaks on the underwater Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines correspond to approximately 32% of annual Danish carbon dioxide emissions. Danish emissions in 2020 were approximately 45 million tonnes of CO2.\n\nSabotage was suspected to have caused the leaks, and seismologists said Tuesday that explosions rattled the Baltic Sea before they were discovered. Some European officials and energy experts have said Russia is likely to blame since it directly benefits from higher energy prices and economic anxiety across Europe. But others cautioned against pointing fingers until investigators are able to determine what happened.\n\nMethane seen bubbling at the ocean surface was an indication of \"a strong upward flow,\" according to Paul Balcombe, a member of the engineering faculty at the department of chemical engineering at Imperial College London.\n\nThe loss of pressure in the pipe likely meant a large amount of gas was already lost, he said. The impacts of the gas leak are still coming into focus, Balcombe said, but are likely to be significant.\n\n\"It would have a very large environmental and climate impact indeed, even if it released a fraction of this,\" he said.\n\nMethane is a major contributor to climate change, responsible for a significant share of the climate disruption people are already experiencing. That is because it is 82.5 times more potent than carbon dioxide at absorbing the sun's heat and warming the Earth.\n\nB\u00f6ttzauw, told a press conference that the agency expects the gas to be out of the pipes, that run from Russia to Germany, by Sunday.\n\n\"We believe that half the gas is out by now of one of the two pipes,\" B\u00f6ttzauw said. \"We are talking about a huge spill of several million cubic meters of gas.\"\n\nThe Danish agency statement added that its calculation was based on information from operators Nord Stream AG and Nord Stream 2 AG about the content of natural gas in the three pipelines that are leaking.\n\nThe incidents come as the EU struggles to keep a lid on soaring gas and electricity prices.\n\n\"As long as there is gas, it dangerous to be there,\" B\u00f6ttzauw said, declining to say when experts would be able to go down and see the pipes, which he said was made of 12-centimeter (5-inch) thick steel coated with concrete.

Neither pipeline was in operation, but both contained natural gas.\n\nNatural gas leaks are an environmental hazard The gas from the Nord Stream pipeline leaks would have been burned for energy use regardless of the leak, so it is unlikely that more emissions were released than normal.\n\nMethane is the main component of natural gas and significantly more harmful than carbon dioxide, the biggest contributor to climate change.\n\nThe only reason methane is not the biggest contributor to the warming of our planet is because there is far less of it in our atmosphere than CO2 -- only about 0.00017%, or 1.7 parts per million. There's around 200 times more CO2 floating around.\n\nResearch has found that methane emissions are 80 times worse than carbon dioxide emissions over a 20 year scale -- and that they already account for roughly 30% of global warming.\n\nMethane contributes to climate crisis via greenhouse effect Greenhouse gases such as methane act as a blanket insulating the Earth. They absorb energy and slow the rate at which heat leaves the planet through a process called the greenhouse effect.\n\nFor centuries, the greenhouse effect has occurred organically because of the natural release of methane and carbon dioxide from plants, animals and wetland areas.\n\nHuman activity over the past 150 years has prompted a huge rise in artificial greenhouse gas emissions, causing global temperatures to soar at an alarming rate.\n\nData show that the impact of a man-made climate crisis from greenhouse gas emissions is already being felt around the world -- including in Germany.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions increasing in Europe Global leaders have acknowledged that reducing methane emissions is vital to limiting global warming and averting the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nAt the UN global climate conference COP26 late last year, more than 100 nations pledged to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030. Governments in Europe have been criticized for U-turns on the pledges. Energy-related greenhouse gas emissions are currently 6% higher than they were when the conference took place less than a year ago.\n\nSince the start of the war in Ukraine, countries such as Germany have been scrambling to replace cheap natural gas imports from Russia with short-term solutions like the reopening of coal plants.\n\nWill closing Nord Stream change energy strategies? Nord Stream 1 and 2 are now shut down indefinitely because of the leaks -- but many countries in Europe, including Germany, rely on these gas pipelines for energy.\n\nRoughly 10% of Germany's energy comes from gas, and, although the country has stored enough to keep it going for some months, those stores will run out.\n\nIt is currently unclear how closing the Nord Stream pipelines will affect the European Union's energy strategies in the coming months.", "source": {"uri": "dailyfinland.fi", "dataType": "news", "title": "clickittefaq"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.dailyfinland.fi/assets/news_photos/2022/09/28/image-29153.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 15, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 29, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7207034493", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-29", "time": "20:55:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-29T20:55:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-29T20:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7764706015586853, "url": "https://gizmodo.com/pipeline-explosion-may-be-single-biggest-methane-leak-i-1849598645", "title": "Nord Pipeline Explosion May Have Caused Single Biggest Methane Leak in History", "body": "Experts say a massive amount of methane was released into the atmosphere due to possible explosions in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines.\n\nThe war between Europe and Russia may be responsible for a new horror: a shockingly large release of damaging greenhouse gas.\n\nEarlier this week, three leaks in two natural gas pipelines, the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, in the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Poland were discovered by officials, with monitoring stations logging big spikes in methane from the leaks. On Thursday, Swedish officials said that they have found a fourth leak in the pipelines, which run between Russia and Germany. Seismologists say that explosions and drops of pressure were logged in the area, leading several European officials to suggest the breaches may be an act of sabotage against European energy stability, possibly from Russia. Russia on Thursday denied responsibility.\n\nAccording to official estimates of the leak provided by the Danish government, in a worst-case scenario, the pipeline could have discharged 778 million cubic meters of gas. Two separate climate scientists told the AP that the damage could work out to about half a million metric tons of methane. That's some five times larger than the amount of methane leaked in the Aliso Canyon accident in California in 2016 -- which, to date, is the largest single release of methane in history. Even a more conservative estimate provided to the AP by the advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund still puts the amount of methane potentially released by this explosion to be twice as much as the Aliso leak.\n\nSome experts told the Washington Post that an individual release of methane like this, while worrisomely large, won't be enough on its own to do significant damage to the atmosphere.\n\n\"It's not trivial, but it's a modest-sized U.S. city, something like that,\" Drew Shindell, a professor of earth science at Duke University, told the Washington Post. \"There are so many sources all around the world. Any single event tends to be small. I think this tends to fall in that category.\"\n\nStill, other experts warned that in a worst-case scenario, the leak could represent 0.1 percent of worldwide methane emissions each year. \"Even a little leak has quite a climate impact,\" Paul Balcombe, an energy expert London's Queen Mary University, told the Post.\n\nAnd even if the amount of methane released isn't enough to make a worldwide dent in greenhouse gas emissions doesn't mean that it wasn't a jaw-dropping amount -- and indicative of just how damaging oil and gas industry infrastructure can be when it malfunctions or is damaged. Kristoffer B\u00f6ttzauw, head of the Danish Energy Agency, told the AP that the emissions from the leaks are equivalent to about a third of the annual total Danish CO2 emissions, thanks to methane's intensity.\n\nMethane only lasts for around a decade in the atmosphere, which means that over the long term it is less damaging than carbon dioxide. However, methane is about 80 times more potent than CO2, which means that it really packs a punch when it's in the atmosphere. Global methane emissions, primarily driven by the agriculture and the oil and gas industry, have risen so sharply in recent years, and our time to act on climate is so limited, that for the first time the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change advised in its landmark report last year that drawing down methane emissions in the short term will be crucial to reaching global climate goals.\n\n\"Whoever ordered this should be prosecuted for war crimes and go to jail,\" Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist, told the AP.", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/a45c36fbd68d8eca8d79f659cc2a4d3a.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 10, "stanza_neu": 11, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 23, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7205294638", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-28", "time": "15:07:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-28T15:07:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-28T15:07:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7764706015586853, "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/world/nord-stream-gas-leak-impact-transcends-nations-may-cause-severe-global-warming-11664370148116.html", "title": "Nord stream gas leak impact transcends nations, may cause severe global warming", "body": "Europe has claimed that the explosion were a deliberate move to 'sabotage' by Russia with connection to the ongoing war between Moscow and Ukraine.

How veer, scientists are clamoring to figure out how much of the residual methane gas did get released in to the environment.\n\nFor the uninitiated, the methane gas can cause grave damage to the Ozone layer in the environment. While the Nord Stream 1 pipelines were halted, and Nordstream 2 had never even started -- they all contained pressurized natural gas, the vast majority of which is methane.\n\nThe expulsion of methane, comes amid growing public consciousness of its effects on the climate. At the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, over 100 countries pledged to drastically curb emissions.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg report, Greenpeace's European Union unit put the figure to potentially as much as 30 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. If those estimates are close to being accurate, it would be one of the biggest methane leaks ever.\n\nNotably, if the entire stock of natural gas escapes into the environment, it will result in around 200,000 tonnes of methane emissions. Experts estimate that such an amount will have about the same global warming potential over a 100-year timeframe as about 6 million tons of carbon dioxide.\n\nMethane is the primary contributor to the formation of ground-level ozone, a hazardous air pollutant and greenhouse gas, exposure to which causes 1 million premature deaths every year.

This mostly consists of methane - a greenhouse gas that is the biggest cause of climate heating after carbon dioxide.\n\nThe extent of the leaks is still unclear but rough estimates by scientists, based on the volume of gas reportedly in one of the pipelines, vary between 100,000 and 350,000 tonnes of methane.\n\nJasmin Cooper, a research associate at Imperial College London's department of chemical engineering, said a \"lot of uncertainty\" surrounded the leak.\n\n\"We know there are three explosions but we don't know if there are three holes in the sides of the pipe or how big the breaks are,\" said Cooper. \"It's difficult to know how much is reaching the surface. But it is potentially hundreds of thousands of tonnes of methane: quite a big volume being pumped into the atmosphere.\"\n\nNord Stream 2, which was intended to increase the flow of gas from Russia to Germany, reportedly contained 300m cubic metres of gas when Berlin halted the certification process shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nThat volume alone would translate to 200,000 tonnes of methane, Cooper said. If it all escaped, it would exceed the 100,000 tonnes of methane vented by the Aliso Canyon blowout, the biggest gas leak in US history, which happened in California in 2015. Aliso had the warming equivalent of half a million cars.\n\n\"It has the potential to be one of the biggest gas leaks,\" said Cooper. \"The climate risks from the methane leak are quite large. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, 30 times stronger than CO over 100 years and more than 80 times stronger over 20 years.\"\n\nProf Grant Allen, an expert in Earth and environmental science at Manchester University, said it was unlikely that natural processes, which convert small amounts of methane into carbon dioxide, would be able to absorb much of the leak.\n\nAllen said: \"This is a colossal amount of gas, in really large bubbles. If you have small sources of gas, nature will help out by digesting the gas. In the Deepwater Horizon spill, there was a lot of attenuation of methane by bacteria.\n\n\"My scientific experience is telling me that - with a big blow-up like this - methane will not have time to be attenuated by nature. So a significant proportion will be vented as methane gas.\"\n\nUnlike an oil spill, gas will not have as polluting an effect on the marine environment, Allen said. \"But in terms of greenhouse gases, it's a reckless and unnecessary emission to the atmosphere.\"\n\nGermany's environment agency said there were no containment mechanisms on the pipeline, so the entire contents were likely to escape.\n\nThe Danish Energy Agency said on Wednesday that the pipelines contained 778m cubic metres of natural gas in total - the equivalent of 32% of Danish annual CO emissions.\n\nThis is almost twice the volume initially estimated by scientists. This would significantly bump up estimates of methane leaked to the atmosphere, from 200,000 to more than 400,000 tonnes. More than half the gas had left the pipes and the remainder is expected be gone by Sunday, the agency said.\n\nJean-Francois Gauthier, vice-president of measurements at the commercial methane-measuring satellite firm GHGSat, said evaluating the total gas volume emitted was \"challenging\".\n\n\"There is little information on the size of the breach and whether it is still going on\" Gauthier said. \"If it's a significant enough breach, it would empty itself.\n\n\"It's safe to say that we're talking about hundreds of thousands of tonnes of methane. In terms of leaks, it's certainly a very serious one.

Over 20 years, however, methane is 80 times worse, according to recent research.\n\nThat's important because the world is on track to exceed the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to less than 2 degrees in mere decades.\n\n\"If I thought we had 100 years to deal with climate change, I'd be an awful lot more relaxed about it,\" Mike Berners-Lee, expert and author on carbon footprints, said. \"If you're interested in the climate impacts we'll be experiencing in 2050 ... you'd be absolutely screaming about methane emissions.\"\n\nMethane's frontloaded climate impact is doubly worrying because the world is closer than previously thought to crossing \"tipping points\" at which climate feedback loops kick in to make global warming self-perpetuating.\n\nA study in September suggested that some of the events that could touch off those feedback loops, like the collapse of the Greenland Ice Sheet or the melting of Arctic permafrost, are imminent.\n\nWhere it comes from\n\nThree-fifths of the world's estimated methane emissions are from human activity; the rest, from natural sources like swamps.\n\nOf the human-caused emissions, two-thirds are from livestock farming and fossil fuels, with much of the rest from decomposing waste as well as rice cultivation, Climate and Clean Air Coalition data shows.\n\nBut emitters have not kept good records and scientists trying to improve them in the past decade have had a shock.\n\n\"Everywhere we looked, methane emissions turned out to be higher than agencies said they should be,\" said Robert Jackson, who was the lead author of the September study on climate tipping points. \"That was true of oil and gas fields, landfills and feedlots.\"\n\nWhile scientists can accurately measure the level of methane in the atmosphere, understanding where it is coming from is crucial for policymakers seeking to impose regulations that reduce the emissions.\n\nWorse than coal?\n\nPetroleum-producing companies and nations are lobbying hard for natural gas as a \"bridge fuel\" to renewables as the world undertakes a clean energy transition to fight climate change.

Around 90% of that is methane, a greenhouse gas with more than 80 times the global warming power of carbon dioxide (CO2).\n\nThat's comparable to the infamous Aliso Canyon leak in the United States in 2016, which released 97,000 tons of methane into the open air. The difference is that leak was more gradual, occurring over a much longer period.\n\nThe worry with Nord Stream is the event could be so large and rapid that it adds a huge chunk to the world's emissions of methane, which is already escaping in enormous volumes from gas, oil and coal infrastructure, and has a quick warming effect on the planet.\n\nGas leak at Nord Stream 2 as seen from the Danish F-16 interceptor on September 27. Danish Defence Command/Forsvaret Ritzau Scanpix/Reuters\n\nThe leak was discovered earlier this week and seismologists said they detected explosions at the site, which probably caused the pipelines to rupture. On Thursday, Sweden's coast guard confirmed a fourth leak in the pipelines. One of its vessels near the source of two leaks that are in Swedish waters is reporting a steady flow of gas to the surface.\n\nThere are still many unknowns around what happened to the pipelines, which have been used as bargaining chips during the energy crisis and Russia's war in Ukraine. Who is responsible, as well as geopolitical, economic and security questions, remain unanswered.\n\n\"We're very worried,\" said Zitely Tzompa Sosa, an atmospheric scientist at the Clean Air Task Force (CATF), a climate non-profit organization.\n\nBased on data from Nord Stream AG, the operator of the pipelines, Tzompa Sosa says that that between 100 and 120 kilotons of methane were probably in Nord Stream 1 at the time of the rupture.\n\n\"That would be equivalent to about a third of Germany's total methane emissions from the energy sector in 2020, which is about 5% of Europe's methane emissions from the energy sector,\" Sosa told CNN, assuming the greenhouse gas entered the atmosphere.\n\nQuantifying the leak at the moment is a rough estimate. Nord Stream 1 stopped supplying gas to Europe in July and Nord Stream 2 never fully opened, making certainty about the volume impossible.\n\nOther climate scientists are less conservative in their estimates. Although Nord Stream 2 never fully opened, the pipe has a capacity of 200 kilotons.\n\nPaul Balcombe, a lecturer in chemical engineering at Imperial College London, told CNN that 200 kilotons of gas entering the atmosphere would equate to about 10% of the UK's total methane emissions.\n\nMethane and CO2 are both greenhouse gases, but they behave in different ways. Balcombe told CNN that methane is a far greater risk to \"near term warming\" than CO2. Although methane only lasts \"around 10 years in the atmosphere,\" its immediate impact is \"much more potent.\"\n\nBut even in the longer term, it's still worse.\n\n\"Over an average of 100 years, it's about 30 times worse than CO2,\" Balcombe told CNN, referring to methane's warming power. As governments scramble to reduce their emissions, \"causing these big leaks right now is going to worsen near-term warming.\"\n\nPipes at the landfall facilities of the Nord Stream 1 in Lubmin, Germany in March. Hannibal Hanschke/Reuters Why methane leaks matter\n\nGas leaks are much more harmful to the climate than simply burning gas for use. The raw molecular form in which the methane leaks from the pipes and enters the atmosphere is worse than if the gas had been used in homes, for example, for heating.\n\nWhen methane is burned, for instance in domestic kitchens, \"the compounds that are released from the combustion are not as dangerous to the climate as methane itself,\" Tzompa Sosa said.\n\nRowan Emslie, a spokesperson at CATF, said many gas production factories had \"safety systems\" designed to burn any gas that escaped in a leak, since this is preferable to allowing the raw methane to enter the atmosphere.\n\n\"It's still CO2 emissions, it's still bad - but it's not nearly so bad,\" Emslie told CNN.\n\nIt's really the pace at which the gas has entered the atmosphere that is concerning.\n\n\"The unprecedented aspect is that we don't think we've seen a leak this large, this fast before,\" Emslie said, \"which is why it's so worrying.\"\n\nThe fact that the Nord Stream leaks occurred underwater complicates understanding further. Factors as varied as the size of the gas bubbles, the concentration of methane-eating microbes in the water, and the depth from which the gas traveled upward, can all affect the overall environmental impact. Monitoring the emissions will also be difficult, as most satellites only capture methane concentration over land, rather than in the sea.\n\nUnderstanding the full picture will \"take a little bit more time - months, potentially years,\" Sosa said.\n\nThe event itself may be over quite quickly. Grant Allen, an environmental scientist at the University of Manchester, stressed to CNN this is a \"time-limited event.\"\n\nIf the flow of gas has been shut off, as Russia has claimed, the pace at which it is released will slow as the pressure in the pipes drops. In this case, the sea will not be \"boiling\" for much longer.", "source": {"uri": "edition.cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christian_edwards@edition.cnn.com", "name": "Christian Edwards", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220927165357-01-nord-stream-leak-aerial-092722.jpg?q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 15, "stanza_neu": 30, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 46, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7206763610", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-29", "time": "16:12:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-29T16:12:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-29T15:16:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/nord-stream-pipeline-methane-gas-151602636.html", "title": "The Nord Stream pipeline methane gas leak could be one of the largest and pose a huge climate change risk, experts say", "body": "It's unclear how much methane is reaching the atmosphere, but this could be \"disastrous,\" an expert said.\n\nReports that a natural gas pipeline has ruptured in the Baltic Sea are causing fears that the methane leak could negatively impact climate change, experts said.\n\nExperts told various news outlets though it is too early to say how much methane from the Nord Stream pipelines will reach the atmosphere, the leaks have the potential to have a substantial effect on climate change.\n\n\"There are a number of uncertainties, but if these pipelines fail, the impact to the climate will be disastrous and could even be unprecedented,\" atmospheric chemist David McCabe, senior scientist at the non-profit Clean Air Task Force, told Reuters.\n\nThough carbon dioxide (CO2) remains the main long-term driver of the climate crisis, methane leaks have become a hot-button issue to help control the progression of the climate crisis in the short term.\n\nThat's because methane is a greenhouse gas -- it very effectively traps heat from the planet in the atmosphere instead of letting it dissipate into space.\n\nThough it is not as long-lived as CO2, which floats in the atmosphere for much longer after it is released, methane is much better at trapping heat: about 30 times better than CO2 over 100 years.\n\nBecause of this, sharp cuts to methane emissions are a vital lever to curb the rate of climate change in the short term.\n\nIf all of the methane contained in the pipelines were to reach the atmosphere, it could seriously set the world back.\n\nFour leaks have now been found along the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines that cross the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe leaks are thought to be the result of \"deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,\" NATO said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThough the pipelines were not being used when they were breached, they were full of natural gas -- about 778 million cubic meters in total, per The Danish Energy Agency.\n\nSeventy to 90% of natural gas is methane.\n\nIf it were all released from the pipeline, that would be the equivalent of 32% of the Danish annual CO2 emissions in 2020.\n\nBut it's not clear how much of that methane will reach the atmosphere.\n\nHow much of the methane contained in the Nord Stream pipelines will reach the atmosphere is difficult to estimate, Cooper told Reuters.\n\nThe rate of emission depends on how big the breach is and other factors, Jasmin Cooper, a research associate at Imperial College London's department of chemical engineering, told The Guardian.\n\nEven without the pipelines emptying completely, the emissions could be substantial.\n\nJean-Francois Gauthier, vice president of measurements at the commercial methane-measuring satellite firm GHGSat, provided Reuters with a \"conservative estimate\" of emissions at the time of the breach.\n\nHe thinks altogether, the leaks likely released about 500 metric tons of methane per hour into the sea at first and are releasing less over time.\n\nBy comparison, the 2015-2016 Aliso Canyon leak released 97,000 metric tons of methane into the air in total, CNN reported.\n\nThat doesn't mean all of that methane will reach the surface.

"title": "'Disturbing' Nord Stream leaks show danger of global methane emissions", "body": "\u00a9 Handout The two Nord Stream gas pipelines linking Russia and Europe have been hit by leaks\n\nPlanet-heating methane spewing into the atmosphere from the damaged Nord Stream pipelines only has a modest impact on climate change, say scientists, but sharply highlights the risks of fossil-fuel driven greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe European Union has said it believes the leaks to the strategically important pipelines, Nord Stream 1 and 2, were caused by a \"deliberate act\".\n\nWhile not in operation the pipelines still contained gas, and Danish authorities said they will now likely continue to empty out, with leaks expected to continue for at least a week.\n\nWith only rough estimates available as to how much natural gas might bubble up through the Baltic Sea, scientists expressed concerns about climate and environmental impacts -- but stressed that the amounts of methane involved were a tiny fraction of global emissions.\n\n\"It is a real travesty, an environmental crime if it was deliberate,\" said Jeffrey Kargel, senior scientist at the Planetary Research Institute in Arizona, calling the leak \"disturbing\".\n\nBut he added: \"Although the amount of gas lost from the pipeline obviously is large, it is not the climate disaster one might think.\"\n\nWhat gas is leaking?\n\nNatural gas is composed primarily of methane.\n\nThis is about 28 times more powerful than carbon dioxide on a century-long timescale -- although it only lingers in the atmosphere for about a decade, compared to hundreds or thousands of years for C02.\n\nSome of the methane emitted from the pipes will be oxidised in the water into C02, said Grant Allen, professor of Atmospheric Physics at the University of Manchester.\n\n\"But given how violent the venting of natural gas appears to be, most of the gas will reach the sea surface as methane,\" he said.\n\nMethane is responsible for roughly 30 percent of the global rise in temperatures to date, even though it is far less abundant in the atmosphere than CO2.\n\nHow big is the leak?\n\nThis is the subject of much uncertainty, although some experts and organisations have attempted to calculate the potential amount of gas in the pipelines.\n\nOne estimate is that there was up to 177 million cubic metres of natural gas still in Nord Stream 2, said Allen.\n\n\"This is not a small amount of gas, and represents a reckless emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,\" he said, adding it was equivalent to the natural gas used by 124,000 UK homes in a year.\n\nGreenpeace have used similar figures to roughly estimate that the leak emissions could be equivalent to eight months of Denmark's total greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nPaul Balcombe, an honorary lecturer at the Department of Chemical Engineering at Imperial College London, said estimates for the gas in the pipes range from around 150 to 300 million cubic metres.\n\n\"It is unlikely that they will release all their contents,\" he told the Science Media Centre.\n\nBut he added if just one of the pipes did completely empty out it would be about twice as much as the worst methane leak recorded in the United States, the 2015 Aliso Canyon leak.\n\n\"It would have a very large environmental and climate impact indeed, even if it released a fraction of this,\" he said.\n\nLauri Myllyvirta from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air said he has calculated an estimated potential leak of between 180 and 270 kilotons from the two pipelines.\n\nThis figure is significant but, he said, is probably only 1.5 percent of the total annual methane emissions from oil and gas operations in Russia.\n\nThe International Energy Agency estimates this was some 18 million tonnes in 2021.\n\nHow does it compare to global emissions?\n\nThe IEA has decried the enormous amount of methane that leaks from fossil fuel operations every year -- estimating the amount lost last year globally was broadly similar to all the gas used in Europe's power sector.\n\nThe leak will certainly have a \"strong immediate warming effect and cause poor air quality\" Piers Forster, director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate at the University of Leeds.\n\nBut ultimately its effect is small compared to the daily leaks from the world's poorly-maintained gas networks, which see around 10 percent of global gas supply lost.\n\nExperts said the incident further underscores the need to urgently switch from polluting fossil fuels, both to combat climate change and ensure energy security.\n\nThis year's energy crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine has already \"supercharged the clean energy transition\", Myllyvirta said.\n\nKargel, who calculated that the Nord Stream leak was roughly equivalent to 2.5 hours of global emissions, said it was a reminder of the urgent need to slash greenhouse emissions.\n\n\"The global climate is changing drastically, with huge impacts on extreme climate mounting every year, decade after decade,\" he said.\n\nklm/mh/rox\n\nRead more", "source":

disruption could cause a climate calamity - although to what extent is still unclear.\n\nNeither pipeline was in operation, but both contained natural gas - which is largely composed of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that is the second-biggest cause of climate change after CO2.\n\n\"There are a number of uncertainties, but if these pipelines fail, the impact to the climate will be disastrous and could even be unprecedented,\" said atmospheric chemist David McCabe, who is senior scientist at the non-profit Clean Air Task Force.\n\nMcCabe and other emissions experts told Reuters that it was not yet possible to assess the size of the leak, given uncertainties around factors such as the temperature of the gas in the pipeline, how fast it's leaking, and how much gas would be absorbed by microbes in the water before reaching the surface.\n\nBut since both Nord Stream pipelines contained mostly methane, \"the potential for a massive and highly damaging emission event is very worrisome\", McCabe said.\n\nOver a 20-year timeframe, methane has more than 80 times the planet-warming potency of carbon dioxide, and roughly 30 times its potency over 100 years. Scientists say sharp cuts in methane emissions over the next few years will be a vital lever in curbing climate change.\n\nHARD TO QUANTIFY\n\nJasmin Cooper, a research associate at Imperial College London's Sustainable Gas Institute, said it would be difficult to quantify exactly how much gas was reaching the atmosphere - especially given scarce existing data on leaks from subsea pipelines.\n\n\"Gazprom will probably have an estimate based on gas throughputs, but in terms of how much gas/methane is emitted into the atmosphere ... they need to send out a team now to measure and monitor,\" she said, referring to the state-owned Russian gas firm.\n\nMethane leaks from onshore gas leaks can be picked up by a growing network of special satellites, but due to the different reflection of light on water it is challenging to use satellites to analyse offshore leaks, said Christian Lelong, director for climate solutions at satellite data firm Kayrros.\n\nFlyovers with planes or drones could be alternative solutions, analysts said.\n\nA \"conservative estimate\" based on available data suggests the leaks together were releasing more than 500 metric tons of methane per hour when first breached, with the pressure and flow rate decreasing over time, said Jean-Francois Gauthier, vice president of measurements at the commercial methane-measuring satellite firm GHGSat.\n\nBy comparison, the huge Aliso Canyon gas leak in the United States in 2016 spewed around 50 tons of methane per hour at its peak. \"So this would be an order of magnitude more,\" Gauthier said.\n\nA spokesman for Nord Stream 2 - one of the leaking pipelines, which never started operating and was shelved by Germany just before Russia invaded Ukraine - said this week the system held 300 million cubic metres of gas.\n\nReleasing that amount in entirety to the atmosphere would result in around 200,000 tonnes of methane emissions, said chemical engineer Paul Balcombe at London's Queen Mary University.\n\nGerman non-profit Deutsche Umwelthilfe gave a similar estimate of the pipeline's potential emissions.\n\nThat amount of methane would have about the same global warming potential over a 100-year timeframe as about 6 million tons of carbon dioxide, according to Reuters calculations based on IPCC conversion factors. That's roughly on par with the amount of CO2 emitted in an entire year by mid-sized cities such as Havana, or Helsinki or Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThe amount of gas leaking from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline system is less clear, with a pipeline spokesman declining to say how much was left in the system when it was taken offline for maintenance a few weeks ago.\n\nStefano Grassi, head of the European Union energy commissioner's cabinet, said Tuesday that the leaks risked becoming \"a climate and ecological disaster\".\n\n\"We are in contact with [EU member states] to look into what happened and find the fastest way to stop leaks and avoid worse damage,\" Grassi said in a tweet.\n\nEU countries were among more than 100 countries, including the United States, Brazil, Pakistan and Mexico that pledged last year to slash their combined methane emissions by 30% by 2030, in a bid to help stave off disastrous levels of climate change.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL RISK\n\nWhile oil spills can immediately affect and ultimately kill wildlife, authorities say the gas pipeline gas leaks pose a limited threat to the surrounding plant and animal life.\n\nThe German environment ministry said the leaks would not pose a significant threat to marine life, but Greenpeace raised concerns on Tuesday that fish may get caught in plumes of gas, which could interfere with their breathing.\n\nDenmark's Energy Agency told Reuters said it was too early to say who would investigate the Nord Stream 2 leak and no-one has been to look at the pipeline yet.It added the leaks will likely continue for several days and perhaps even a week.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2022/02/nord-stream-2-770x433.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 19, "stanza_neu": 11, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 30, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7207112963", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-29", "time": "22:44:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-29T22:44:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-29T21:08:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7411764860153198, "url": "https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20220929/news/309299825", "title": "Baltic Sea pipeline leak damages marine life and climate", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Methane escaping from the damaged Nord Stream pipelines that run between Russia and Europe is likely to result in the biggest known gas leak to take place over a short period of time and highlights the problem of large methane escapes elsewhere around the world, scientists say.\n\n'\u009cFrom what I have seen this is an unprecedented loss to the atmosphere of fossil methane in a very short time from a concentrated source,'' said President of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences Marcia McNutt.

That is because it is 82.5 times more potent than carbon dioxide at absorbing the sun's heat and warming the Earth, over the short term.\n\nClimate scientist have found that methane emissions from the oil and gas industry are far worse than what companies are reporting, despite claims by major companies that they've reduced their emissions.\n\nScientists measuring methane from satellites in space have found that emissions from oil and gas operations are usually at least twice as high as what the companies reported, said Thomas Lauvaux, climate scientist at University of Reims in France.\n\nMany of those so-called leaks are not accidental. Companies release the gas during routine maintenance. Lauvaux and other scientists observed more than 1,500 major methane leaks globally, and potentially tens of thousands of smaller leaks, using satellites, he said.\n\n-\n\nAP reporters Patrick Whittle contributed from Portland, Maine, Seth Borenstein from Washington, DC., and Cathy Bussewitz from New York.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Many so-called super-emitting events -- large continuous discharges of methane -- are captured by satellite imagery over land-based pipelines or fossil-fuel production sites. But capturing accurate data over water is far more challenging given the light that reflects of the surface.\n\nThere are a number of other key uncertainties -- how much gas was in the pipelines at the time, what temperature and pressure it was being held at, and just how big the size of the rupture in the pipes was. Even when the gas escapes, some is likely to have dissipated into the water, but that also depends on the density of microbial life, as well as the depth. To obtain accurate readings, a plane would probably have to take measurements from the air.\n\nDespite that, scientists on social media were quick to do some back-of-the envelope calculations into just how much methane might have escaped. Andrew Baxter, director of energy strategy at the Environmental Defense Fund, estimated that around 115,000 tons of methane escaped, equivalent to around 9.6 million tons of Carbon Dioxide. In real terms, that's the same climate impact as the emissions from 2 million gasoline cars over the course of a year, or two-and-a-half coal-fired power stations.\n\nIf that's close to being accurate, it would be one of the biggest methane leaks ever. The biggest known release in the US happened at gas storage facility in Aliso Canyon, Los Angeles, in 2015, where an estimated 97,100 metric tons of methane was emitted over several months. By comparison, the Nord Stream leaks may have happened over the course of several hours.\n\nThe expulsion of methane comes amid growing public consciousness of its effects on the climate. At the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, over 100 countries pledged to drastically curb emissions. The European Union is also in the process of legislation that would raise the obligation on companies to reduce flaring of the gas, conduct regular inspections to stem leaks and boost transparency of leaks associated with imports.\n\nAt an event in the European Parliament Tuesday evening to launch \"methane week,\" lawmakers, scientists and environmentalists discussed how to measure the scale of the leak, but were united on one thing -- it is likely to be an environmental disaster. The Green group's co-lead negotiator for the bloc's methane regulation, Jutta Paulus, pointed the finger firmly toward Russia, coming the same week as the Baltic Pipeline -- connecting Norway to Poland -- was opened.\n\n\"I don't think it's a coincidence that this is happened on the day the Baltic pipeline was opened,\" Paulus said at the event.

This is largely composed of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that is the second biggest cause of climate change after CO2.\n\n\"There are a number of uncertainties, but if these pipelines fail, the impact to the climate will be disastrous and could even be unprecedented,\" says atmospheric chemist David McCabe, senior scientist at the non-profit Clean Air Task Force.\n\nOver a 20-year timeframe, methane has more than 80 times the planet-warming potency of carbon dioxide, and roughly 30 times its potency over 100 years. Scientists say sharp cuts in methane emissions over the next few years will be a vital lever in curbing climate change.\n\nMcCabe and other emissions experts say it is not yet possible to assess the size of the leak. This is due to uncertainties around factors such as the temperature of the gas in the pipeline, how fast it is leaking, and how much gas would be absorbed by microbes in the water before reaching the surface.\n\nBut since both Nord Stream pipelines contained mostly methane, \"the potential for a massive and highly damaging emission event is very worrisome\", says McCabe.\n\nJasmin Cooper, a research associate at Imperial College London's Sustainable Gas Institute, agrees it will be difficult to quantify exactly how much gas is reaching the atmosphere - especially given scarce existing data on leaks from subsea pipelines.\n\n\"Gazprom will probably have an estimate based on gas throughputs, but in terms of how much gas/methane is emitted into the atmosphere... they need to send out a team now to measure and monitor,\" she says, referring to the state-owned Russian gas firm.\n\nA \"conservative estimate\" based on available data suggests the leaks together were releasing more than 500 metric tons of methane per hour when first breached, with the pressure and flow rate decreasing over time, says Jean-Francois Gauthier, vice president of measurements at the commercial methane-measuring satellite firm GHGSat.\n\nBy comparison, the huge Aliso Canyon gas leak in the United States in 2016 spewed around 50 tons of methane per hour at its peak. \"So this would be an order of magnitude more,\" Gauthier adds.\n\nA spokesperson for Nord Stream 2 - one of the leaking pipelines, which never started operating and was shelved by Germany just before Russia invaded Ukraine - said this week the system held 300 million cubic metres of gas.\n\nReleasing that amount in entirety to the atmosphere would result in around 200,000 tonnes of methane emissions, says chemical engineer Paul Balcombe at London's Queen Mary University.\n\nGerman non-profit Deutsche Umwelthilfe gave a similar estimate of the pipeline's potential emissions.\n\nThat amount of methane would have about the same global warming potential over a 100-year timeframe as about 6 million tons of carbon dioxide, according to calculations based on IPCC conversion factors.\n\nThat's roughly on par with the amount of CO2 emitted in an entire year by mid-sized cities such as Havana or Helsinki.\n\nThe amount of gas leaking from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline system is less clear, with a pipeline spokesperson declining to say how much was left in the system when it was taken offline for maintenance a few weeks ago.\n\nStefano Grassi, head of the European Union energy commissioner's cabinet, said on Tuesday that the leaks risked becoming \"a climate and ecological disaster\".\n\n\"We are in contact with [EU member states] to look into what happened and find the fastest way to stop leaks and avoid worse damage,\" Grassi said in a tweet.\n\nEU nations were among more than 100 countries, including the United States, Brazil, Pakistan and Mexico, that pledged last year to slash their combined methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, in a bid to help stave off disastrous levels of climate change.\n\nWhile oil spills can immediately affect and ultimately kill wildlife, authorities say the gas pipeline leaks pose a limited threat to the surrounding plant and animal life.\n\nThe German environment ministry said the leaks would not pose a significant threat to marine life, but Greenpeace raised concerns on Tuesday that fish may get caught in plumes of gas, which could interfere with their breathing.\n\nDenmark's Energy Agency said it is too early to say who will investigate the Nord Stream 2 leak, and no-one has been to look at the pipeline yet.\n\nIt added the leaks will likely continue for several days and perhaps even a week.\n\nAlthough the cause of the Nord Stream gas leaks is still unclear, recent reports from Brussels suggest signs of \"sabotage\" and \"deliberate\" action.\n\nThe first leak was discovered on Nord Stream 2 on Monday evening around the Danish island of Bornholm. Hours later, two leaks were detected on separate sections of Nord Stream 1, reaching both the Danish and Swedish economic zones of the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe infrastructure is at the centre of geopolitical tensions between the EU and Russia, which has been accused of manipulating gas supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions.\n\nSeismologists recorded what they think were explosions before gas began pouring out of two Russia-to-Germany pipelines under the Baltic Sea.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/05/99/80/1000x563_cmsv2_d91a13f7-ed41-5f01-8704-bf75e156b232-7059980.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 20, "stanza_neu": 13, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 33, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7205912765", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-29", "time": "03:40:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-29T03:40:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-29T03:40:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "url": "https://siouxcityjournal.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/record-methane-leak-flows-from-damaged-baltic-sea-pipelines/article_3d06e3a6-5960-51da-a9d3-2bcfa7c77ff5.html", "title": "Record methane leak flows from damaged Baltic Sea pipelines", "body": "Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin looks at Finland's Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto as he speaks during a press conference by the Government of Finland in Helsinki, Finland, Wednesday Sept. 28, 2022.

This principally consists of methane - a greenhouse gas that's the biggest trigger of climate heating after carbon dioxide.\n\nThe extent of the leaks remains to be unclear however tough estimates by scientists, based mostly on the quantity of gas reportedly in a single of the pipelines, fluctuate between 100,000 and 350,000 tonnes of methane.\n\nJasmin Cooper, a analysis affiliate at Imperial College London's division of chemical engineering, stated a \"lot of uncertainty\" surrounded the leak.\n\n\"We know there are three explosions but we don't know if there are three holes in the sides of the pipe or how big the breaks are,\" stated Cooper. \"It's difficult to know how much is reaching the surface. But it is potentially hundreds of thousands of tonnes of methane: quite a big volume being pumped into the atmosphere.\"\n\nNord Stream 2, which was meant to extend the move of gas from Russia to Germany, reportedly contained 300m cubic metres of gas when Berlin halted the certification course of shortly earlier than Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nThat quantity alone would translate to 200,000 tonnes of methane, Cooper stated. If all of it escaped, it could exceed the 100,000 tonnes of methane vented by the Aliso Canyon blowout, the biggest gas leak in US historical past, which occurred in California in 2015. Aliso had the warming equal of half 1,000,000 automobiles.\n\n\"It has the potential to be one of the biggest gas leaks,\" stated Cooper. \"The climate risks from the methane leak are quite large. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, 30 times stronger than CO over 100 years and more than 80 times stronger over 20 years.\"\n\nProf Grant Allen, an knowledgeable in Earth and environmental science at Manchester University, stated it was unlikely that pure processes, which convert small quantities of methane into carbon dioxide, would be capable of take in a lot of the leak.\n\nAllen stated: \"This is a colossal amount of gas, in really large bubbles. If you have small sources of gas, nature will help out by digesting the gas. In the Deepwater Horizon spill, there was a lot of attenuation of methane by bacteria.\n\n\"My scientific experience is telling me that - with a big blow-up like this - methane will not have time to be attenuated by nature. So a significant proportion will be vented as methane gas.\"\n\nUnlike an oil spill, gas is not going to have as polluting an impact on the marine setting, Allen stated. \"But in terms of greenhouse gases, it's a reckless and unnecessary emission to the atmosphere.\"\n\nGermany's setting company stated there have been no containment mechanisms on the pipeline, so the entire contents were likely to escape.\n\nThe Danish Energy Agency stated on Wednesday that the pipelines contained 778m cubic metres of pure gas in whole - the equal of 32% of Danish annual CO emissions.\n\nThis is nearly twice the quantity initially estimated by scientists. This would considerably bump up estimates of methane leaked to the environment, from 200,000 to greater than 400,000 tonnes. More than half the gas had left the pipes and the rest is anticipated be passed by Sunday, the company stated.\n\nJean-Francois Gauthier, vice-president of measurements on the industrial methane-measuring satellite tv for pc agency GHGSat, stated evaluating the whole gas quantity emitted was \"challenging\".\n\n\"There is little information on the size of the breach and whether it is still going on\" Gauthier stated. \"If it's a significant enough breach, it would empty itself.\n\n\"It's safe to say that we're talking about hundreds of thousands of tonnes of methane. In terms of leaks, it's certainly a very serious one. The catastrophic instantaneous nature of this one - I've certainly never seen anything like that before.\"\n\nIn phrases of the climate impression, 250,000 tonnes of methane was equal to the impression of 1.3m automobiles pushed on the highway for a 12 months, Gauthier stated.", "source": {"uri": "pehalnews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pehal News"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 19, "stanza_neu": 15, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 36, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7205032823", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-28", "time": "11:39:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-28T11:39:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-28T10:31:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "url": "https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-nord-stream-gas-leaks/", "title": "expert reaction to Nord Stream gas leaks", "body": "you are here: science media centre > roundups for journalists > expert reaction to Nord Stream gas leaks\n\nThere have been several news reports on the Nord Stream gas leaks following explosions.\n\nProf Grant Allen, Professor of Atmospheric Physics, University of Manchester, said:\n\n\"The environmental impact here is limited to the greenhouse gas emissions (mainly methane) from the natural gas left in the pipe. The impact will be limited as the pipelines are not pumping, just pressurised, so once the gas has escaped, the event will stop.\n\n\"Some of the methane emitted from the pipeline on the seabed will be oxidised by methanotrophic microbes (into CO2) as it rises in the water column. But given how violent the venting of natural gas appears to be, most of the gas will reach the sea surface as methane, a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.\n\n\"It has been estimated that there may be up to 177 million cubic metres of natural gas still residual in Nordstream 2 alone (at 300 Bar). This amount of gas is equivalent to the natural gas used by 124,000 UK homes in a year. This is not a small amount of gas, and represents a reckless emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\"\n\nDr Jasmin Cooper, research associate, Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London:\n\n\"It's hard to accurately quantify the size of the emissions leak. Gazprom will probably have an estimate based on gas throughputs, but in terms of how much gas/methane is emitted into the atmosphere it would be difficult to measure as they need to send out a team now to measure and monitor how much methane is escaping into the atmosphere.\n\n\"In most literature, methane leaks from subsea pipelines are assumed to be zero in terms of impacts to global warming as it's assumed the methane dissolves in the sea water, so doesn't reach the atmosphere - but the Nordstream leak is very different so it is likely methane will bubble to the surface.\n\n\"The climate risks from the methane leak are quite large. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, 30 times stronger than CO2 over 100 years and >80 times stronger over 20-years.\"\n\nDr Paul Balcombe, honorary lecturer, Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London, said:\n\n\"We don't know exactly how much gas was in the pipes, but there are estimates of 150 - 300 million cubic metres. There are three pipes that are leaking - two pipes of Nord Stream 1, and one of Nord Stream 2. It is unlikely that they will release all their contents, but if just one did it would be about twice as much (~200,000 tonnes) as the 2015 Aliso Canyon leak in the US (~90,000 tonnes) which was the worst leak found in the US. It would have a very large environmental and climate impact indeed, even if it released a fraction of this.\"\n\nProf Dave Reay, Executive Director of Edinburgh Climate Change Institute, University of Edinburgh\n\n\"The most direct effect of these gas leaks on climate is the extra dollop of the powerful greenhouse gas methane - the main component of natural gas - they are adding to the atmosphere.\n\n\"That said, this is a wee bubble in the ocean compared to the huge amounts of so-called 'fugitive methane' that are emitted every day around the world due to things like fracking, coal mining and oil extraction.\"\n\nFor all other experts, no reply to our request for DOIs was received.", "source": {"uri": "sciencemediacentre.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Science Media Centre"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 12, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 25, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 2, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7205219932", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-28", "time": "14:07:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-28T14:07:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-28T14:07:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "url": "https://www.dw.com/en/what-does-the-nord-stream-pipeline-gas-leak-mean-for-the-environment/a-63268348", "title": "Nord Stream leaks release methane into environment", "body": "An explosion on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline sends natural gas to the surface of the Baltic Sea.

The long-term impact of the explosion is hard to quantify.\n\n\u02baAccording to our current knowledge, the leaks in the Nord Stream pipeline do not pose any serious threat to the marine environment of the Baltic Sea,\u02ba a spokesperson for Germany's Environment Ministry told DW.\n\nExperts say the long-term climate impact of the emissions will be substantial.\n\n\u02baThe most direct effect of these gas leaks on climate is the extra dollop of the powerful greenhouse gas methane they are adding to the atmosphere,\u02ba Dave Reay, executive director of the University of Edinburgh's Climate Change Institute, said in a statement.\n\n\u02baThat said, this is a wee bubble in the ocean compared to the huge amounts of so-called 'fugitive methane' that are emitted every day around the world due to things like fracking, coal mining and oil extraction,\u02ba he said.\n\nThe scale of the Nord Stream gas leaks is not yet known. Neither pipeline was in operation, but both contained natural gas.\n\nThe gas from the Nord Stream pipeline leaks would have been burned for energy use regardless of the leak, so it is unlikely that more emissions were released than normal.\n\nMethane is the main component of natural gas and significantly more harmful than carbon dioxide, the biggest contributor to climate change.\n\nThe only reason methane is not the biggest contributor to the warming of our planet is because there is far less of it in our atmosphere than CO2 -- only about 0.00017%, or 1.7 parts per million. There's around 200 times more CO2 floating around.\n\nResearch has found that methane emissions are 80 times worse than carbon dioxide emissions over a 20 year scale -- and that they already account for roughly 30% of global warming.\n\nGreenhouse gases such as methane act as a blanket insulating the Earth. They absorb energy and slow the rate at which heat leaves the planet through a process called the greenhouse effect.\n\nFor centuries, the greenhouse effect has occurred organically because of the natural release of methane and carbon dioxide from plants, animals and wetland areas.\n\nHuman activity over the past 150 years has prompted a huge rise in artificial greenhouse gas emissions, causing global temperatures to soar at an alarming rate.\n\nData show that the impact of a man-made climate crisis from greenhouse gas emissions is already being felt around the world -- including in Germany.\n\nGlobal leaders have acknowledged that reducing methane emissions is vital to limiting global warming and averting the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nAt the UN global climate conference COP26 late last year, more than 100 nations pledged to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030.\n\nGovernments in Europe have been criticized for U-turns on the pledges. Energy-related greenhouse gas emissions are currently 6% higher than they were when the conference took place less than a year ago.\n\nSince the start of the war in Ukraine, countries such as Germany have been scrambling to replace cheap natural gas imports from Russia with short-term solutions like the reopening of coal plants.\n\nNord Stream 1 and 2 are now shut down indefinitely because of the leaks -- but many countries in Europe, including Germany, rely on these gas pipelines for energy.\n\nRoughly 10% of Germany's energy comes from gas, and, although the country has stored enough to keep it going for some months, those stores will run out.\n\nIt is currently unclear how closing the Nord Stream pipelines will affect the European Union's energy strategies in the coming months.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.dw.com/image/63255469_6.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 15, "stanza_neu": 13, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 29, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7205778908", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-29", "time": "00:02:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-29T00:02:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-29T00:02:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7215686440467834, "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/nord-stream-gas-leaks-raise-climate-fears-impact-hard-quantify-2970981", "title": "Nord Stream gas leaks raise climate fears, but impact hard to quantify", "body": "Unexplained leaks in two Russian gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea are spewing out greenhouse gas emissions, raising fears that the disruption could cause a climate calamity - although to what extent is still unclear.\n\nNeither pipeline was in operation, but both contained natural gas - which is largely composed of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that is the second biggest cause of climate change after CO2.\n\n\"There are a number of uncertainties, but if these pipelines fail, the impact to the climate will be disastrous and could even be unprecedented,\" said atmospheric chemist David McCabe, who is senior scientist at the non-profit Clean Air Task Force.\n\nMcCabe and other emissions experts told Reuters that it was not yet possible to assess the size of the leak, given uncertainties around factors such as the temperature of the gas in the pipeline, how fast it's leaking, and how much gas would be absorbed by microbes in the water before reaching the surface.\n\nBut since both Nord Stream pipelines contained mostly methane, \"the potential for a massive and highly damaging emission event is very worrisome\", McCabe said.\n\nOver a 20-year timeframe, methane has more than 80 times the planet-warming potency of carbon dioxide, and roughly 30 times its potency over 100 years.

If the gas-air mix was within a certain range, an airplane could easily ignite travelling into the plume, for example.\n\nMethane isn't the only risk. \"Natural gas isn't refined to be super clean -- there are trace elements of other compounds, like benzene,\" a carcinogen, said Leifer.\n\n\"The amount of these trace elements cumulatively entering the environment is significant right now -- this will cause issues for fisheries and marine ecosystems and people who potentially eat those fish,\" he said.\n\nDavid Archer, a professor in the geophysical sciences department at University of Chicago who focuses on the global carbon cycle, said that escape of methane in the Baltic Sea is part of the much larger worldwide problem of methane emissions.\n\nThe gas is a major contributor to climate change, responsible for a significant share of the climate disruption people are already experiencing. That is because it is 82.5 times more potent than carbon dioxide at absorbing the sun's heat and warming the Earth, over the short term.\n\nClimate scientist have found that methane emissions from the oil and gas industry are far worse than what companies are reporting, despite claims by major companies that they've reduced their emissions.\n\nScientists measuring methane from satellites in space have found that emissions from oil and gas operations are usually at least twice as high as what the companies reported, said Thomas Lauvaux, climate scientist at University of Reims in France.\n\nMany of those so-called leaks are not accidental.

OLSEN and PATRICK WHITTLE - Associated Press\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Methane leaking from the damaged Nord Stream pipelines is likely to be the biggest burst of the potent greenhouse gas on record, by far.\n\nThe Nord Stream pipeline leaks that were pumping huge volumes of methane into the Baltic Sea and atmosphere could discharge as much as five times as much of the potent greenhouse as was released by the Aliso Canyon disaster, the largest known terrestrial release of methane in U.S. history. It is also the equivalent of one third of Denmark's total annual greenhouse gas emissions, a Danish official warned Wednesday.\n\n\"Whoever ordered this should be prosecuted for war crimes and go to jail,\" said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist. Two scientists looked at the official worst case scenario estimates provided by the Danish government -- 778 million cubic meters of gas -- for the Associated Press. They calculated that would be an equivalent of roughly half a million metric tons of methane. The Aliso Canyon disaster released 90-100,000 metric tons.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He had a more conservative estimate. But it was still more than double the Aliso Canyon disaster.\n\n\"That's one thing that is consistent with these estimates,\" he said, \"It's catastrophic for the climate.\"\n\nKristoffer B\u00f6ttzauw, head of the Danish Energy Agency, said emissions from the three leaks on the underwater Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines correspond to approximately 32% of annual Danish carbon dioxide emissions. Danish emissions in 2020 were approximately 45 million tonnes of CO2.\n\nSabotage was suspected to have caused the leaks, and seismologists said Tuesday that explosions rattled the Baltic Sea before they were discovered. Some European officials and energy experts have said Russia is likely to blame since it directly benefits from higher energy prices and economic anxiety across Europe.

Over 20 years, however, methane is 80 times worse, according to recent research.\n\nThat's important because the world is on track to exceed the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to less than 2 degrees in mere decades.\n\n\"If I thought we had 100 years to deal with climate change, I'd be an awful lot more relaxed about it,\" Mike Berners-Lee, expert and author on carbon footprints, said. \"If you're interested in the climate impacts we'll be experiencing in 2050 ... you'd be absolutely screaming about methane emissions.\"\n\nMethane's frontloaded climate impact is doubly worrying because the world is closer than previously thought to crossing \"tipping points\" at which climate feedback loops kick in to make global warming self-perpetuating.\n\nA study in September suggested that some of the events that could touch off those feedback loops, like the collapse of the Greenland Ice Sheet or the melting of Arctic permafrost, are imminent.\n\nThree-fifths of the world's estimated methane emissions are from human activity; the rest, from natural sources like swamps.\n\nOf the human-caused emissions, two-thirds are from livestock farming and fossil fuels, with much of the rest from decomposing waste as well as rice cultivation, Climate and Clean Air Coalition data shows.\n\nBut emitters have not kept good records and scientists trying to improve them in the past decade have had a shock.\n\n\"Everywhere we looked, methane emissions turned out to be higher than agencies said they should be,\" said Robert Jackson, who was the lead author of the September study on climate tipping points. \"That was true of oil and gas fields, landfills and feedlots.\"\n\nWhile scientists can accurately measure the level of methane in the atmosphere, understanding where it is coming from is crucial for policymakers seeking to impose regulations that reduce the emissions.\n\nPetroleum-producing companies and nations are lobbying hard for natural gas as a \"bridge fuel\" to renewables as the world undertakes a clean energy transition to fight climate change. Their argument: burning natural gas emits half as much carbon per kilowatt as coal.\n\nBut factor in gas industry leaks from drill pads, pipelines, compressors, and other infrastructure, and those gains can quickly be erased.\n\n\"There's a break-even point in how much methane is leaked for ... natural gas (to be) actually worse than coal for the climate,\" said Sam Abernethy, co-author of the September study.\n\nWorld governments, including the United States, are introducing requirements that the oil and gas industry detect and repair leaks after studies showed leaks in the industry were a huge problem.\n\nThe European Union recently endorsed labeling some natural gas projects as \"green\" in a major boost to the industry.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat is known about the Nord Stream gas pipeline leaks", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_cocks@reuters.com", "name": "Tim Cocks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.reuters.com/resizer/ydZwOrTwG6XqS_HA3c1DiSdXTWw=/1146x600/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/USLK7ZURXZJQJL4HVURMPVASMU.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 13, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 26, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7206379521", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-29", "time": "11:07:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-29T11:07:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-29T11:07:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/29/nord-stream-pipeline-leaks-are-catastrophic-for-the-climate", "title": "Nord Stream pipeline leaks are 'catastrophic for the climate'", "body": "Methane leakage is likely to be the biggest burst of the powerful greenhouse gas on record in one of the most polluted bodies of water.\n\nMethane leaking from yet-to-be explained damage on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines is likely to be the biggest burst of the potent greenhouse gas on record, raising new fears of the effect on the climate emergency.\n\nThe Nord Stream pipeline from Russia to Germany on Thursday was pumping huge volumes of methane into the Baltic Sea as well as the atmosphere - as much as five times more than escaped in the Aliso Canyon disaster - the largest known terrestrial release of methane in US history.\n\nThe leakage could be equivalent to one-third of Denmark's total annual greenhouse gas emissions, head of the Danish Energy Agency Kristoffer B\u00f6ttzauw said.

If the gas-air mix was within a certain range, an airplane could easily ignite travelling into the plume, for example.\n\nMethane isn't the only risk. \"Natural gas isn't refined to be super clean -- there are trace elements of other compounds, like benzene,\" a carcinogen, said Leifer.\n\n\"The amount of these trace elements cumulatively entering the environment is significant right now -- this will cause issues for fisheries and marine ecosystems and people who potentially eat those fish,\" he said.\n\nDavid Archer, a professor in the geophysical sciences department at University of Chicago who focuses on the global carbon cycle, said that escape of methane in the Baltic Sea is part of the much larger worldwide problem of methane emissions.\n\nThe gas is a major contributor to climate change, responsible for a significant share of the climate disruption people are already experiencing. That is because it is 82.5 times more potent than carbon dioxide at absorbing the sun's heat and warming the Earth, over the short term.\n\nClimate scientist have found that methane emissions from the oil and gas industry are far worse than what companies are reporting, despite claims by major companies that they've reduced their emissions.\n\nScientists measuring methane from satellites in space have found that emissions from oil and gas operations are usually at least twice as high as what the companies reported, said Thomas Lauvaux, climate scientist at University of Reims in France.\n\nMany of those so-called leaks are not accidental. Companies release the gas during routine maintenance. Lauvaux and other scientists observed more than 1,500 major methane leaks globally, and potentially tens of thousands of smaller leaks, using satellites, he said.\n\n\u00a9 2022 The Associated Press.

The ministers shared views to current security issues concerning Nord Stream gas pipelines and restrictions on the issuing of visas to Russian citizens.\n\nBy JAN M. OLSEN and PATRICK WHITTLE - Associated Press\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Methane leaking from the damaged Nord Stream pipelines is likely to be the biggest burst of the potent greenhouse gas on record, by far.\n\nThe Nord Stream pipeline leaks that were pumping huge volumes of methane into the Baltic Sea and atmosphere could discharge as much as five times as much of the potent greenhouse as was released by the Aliso Canyon disaster, the largest known terrestrial release of methane in U.S. history. It is also the equivalent of one third of Denmark's total annual greenhouse gas emissions, a Danish official warned Wednesday.\n\n\"Whoever ordered this should be prosecuted for war crimes and go to jail,\" said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist. Two scientists looked at the official worst case scenario estimates provided by the Danish government -- 778 million cubic meters of gas -- for the Associated Press. They calculated that would be an equivalent of roughly half a million metric tons of methane. The Aliso Canyon disaster released 90-100,000 metric tons.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He had a more conservative estimate. But it was still more than double the Aliso Canyon disaster.\n\n\"That's one thing that is consistent with these estimates,\" he said, \"It's catastrophic for the climate.\"\n\nKristoffer B\u00f6ttzauw, head of the Danish Energy Agency, said emissions from the three leaks on the underwater Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines correspond to approximately 32% of annual Danish carbon dioxide emissions. Danish emissions in 2020 were approximately 45 million tonnes of CO2.\n\nSabotage was suspected to have caused the leaks, and seismologists said Tuesday that explosions rattled the Baltic Sea before they were discovered. Some European officials and energy experts have said Russia is likely to blame since it directly benefits from higher energy prices and economic anxiety across Europe. But others cautioned against pointing fingers until investigators are able to determine what happened.\n\nMethane seen bubbling at the ocean surface was an indication of \"a strong upward flow,\" according to Paul Balcombe, a member of the engineering faculty at the department of chemical engineering at Imperial College London.\n\nThe loss of pressure in the pipe likely meant a large amount of gas was already lost, he said. The impacts of the gas leak are still coming into focus, Balcombe said, but are likely to be significant.\n\n\"It would have a very large environmental and climate impact indeed, even if it released a fraction of this,\" he said.\n\nMethane is a major contributor to climate change, responsible for a significant share of the climate disruption people are already experiencing. That is because it is 82.5 times more potent than carbon dioxide at absorbing the sun's heat and warming the Earth.\n\nB\u00f6ttzauw, told a press conference that the agency expects the gas to be out of the pipes, that run from Russia to Germany, by Sunday.\n\n\"We believe that half the gas is out by now of one of the two pipes,\" B\u00f6ttzauw said. \"We are talking about a huge spill of several million cubic meters of gas.\"\n\nThe Danish agency statement added that its calculation was based on information from operators Nord Stream AG and Nord Stream 2 AG about the content of natural gas in the three pipelines that are leaking.\n\nThe incidents come as the EU struggles to keep a lid on soaring gas and electricity prices.\n\n\"As long as there is gas, it dangerous to be there,\" B\u00f6ttzauw said, declining to say when experts would be able to go down and see the pipes, which he said was made of 12-centimeter (5-inch) thick steel coated with concrete. They lie on the seabed between 70 and 90 meters (230 feet and 295 feet) deep.\n\nThe leaks all were in international waters. Two were within the Danish exclusive economic zone while the third is in the Swedish equivalent.\n\nWhittle reported from Portland, Maine.

Already as subscriber, sign in.\n\nA large disturbance in the sea can be observed off the coast of the Danish island of Bornholm on Tuesday following a series of unusual leaks on two natural gas pipelines running from Russia under the Baltic Sea to Germany. Danish Defence Command via Associated Press\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Methane leaking from the damaged Nord Stream pipelines is likely to be the biggest burst of the potent greenhouse gas on record, by far.\n\nThe Nord Stream pipeline leaks that were pumping huge volumes of methane into the Baltic Sea and atmosphere could discharge as much as five times as much of the potent greenhouse as was released by the Aliso Canyon disaster, the largest known terrestrial release of methane in U.S. history. It is also the equivalent of one-third of Denmark's total annual greenhouse gas emissions, a Danish official warned Wednesday.\n\n\"Whoever ordered this should be prosecuted for war crimes and go to jail,\" said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist. Two scientists looked at the official worst-case scenario estimates provided by the Danish government - 778 million cubic meters of gas - for the Associated Press. They calculated that would be an equivalent of roughly half a million metric tons of methane. The Aliso Canyon disaster released 90-100,000 metric tons.\n\nAndrew Baxter, a chemical engineer who formerly worked in the offshore oil and gas industry and is now at the environmental group EDF, thought the Danish estimate was likely too high. He had a more conservative estimate. But it was still more than double the Aliso Canyon disaster.\n\n\"That's one thing that is consistent with these estimates,\" he said, \"It's catastrophic for the climate.\"\n\nKristoffer B\u00f6ttzauw, head of the Danish Energy Agency, said emissions from the three leaks on the underwater Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines correspond to approximately 32 percent of annual Danish carbon dioxide emissions. Danish emissions in 2020 were approximately 45 million tonnes of CO2.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSabotage was suspected to have caused the leaks, and seismologists said Tuesday that explosions rattled the Baltic Sea before they were discovered. Some European officials and energy experts have said Russia is likely to blame since it directly benefits from higher energy prices and economic anxiety across Europe. But others cautioned against pointing fingers until investigators are able to determine what happened.\n\nMethane seen bubbling at the ocean surface was an indication of \"a strong upward flow,\" according to Paul Balcombe, a member of the engineering faculty at the department of chemical engineering at Imperial College London.\n\nThe loss of pressure in the pipe likely meant a large amount of gas was already lost, he said. The impacts of the gas leak are still coming into focus, Balcombe said, but are likely to be significant.\n\n\"It would have a very large environmental and climate impact indeed, even if it released a fraction of this,\" he said.\n\nMethane is a major contributor to climate change, responsible for a significant share of the climate disruption people are already experiencing. That is because it is 82.5 times more potent than carbon dioxide at absorbing the sun's heat and warming the Earth.\n\nB\u00f6ttzauw, told a press conference that the agency expects the gas to be out of the pipes, that run from Russia to Germany, by Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We believe that half the gas is out by now of one of the two pipes,\" B\u00f6ttzauw said. \"We are talking about a huge spill of several million cubic meters of gas.\"\n\nThe Danish agency statement added that its calculation was based on information from operators Nord Stream AG and Nord Stream 2 AG about the content of natural gas in the three pipelines that are leaking.\n\nThe incidents come as the EU struggles to keep a lid on soaring gas and electricity prices.\n\n\"As long as there is gas, it dangerous to be there,\" B\u00f6ttzauw said, declining to say when experts would be able to go down and see the pipes, which he said was made of 5-inch-thick steel coated with concrete. They lie on the seabed between 230 feet and 295 feet deep.\n\nThe leaks all were in international waters. Two were within the Danish exclusive economic zone while the third is in the Swedish equivalent.\n\nRelated Headlines Blasts precede Baltic pipeline leaks, sabotage seen likely\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Around 90% of that's methane, a greenhouse gas with greater than 80 occasions the worldwide warming energy of carbon dioxide (CO2).\n\nThat's corresponding to the notorious Aliso Canyon leak within the United States in 2016, which launched 97,000 tons of methane into the open air. The distinction is that leak was extra gradual, occurring over a for much longer interval.\n\nThe fear with Nord Stream is the occasion could be so massive and fast that it provides an enormous chunk to the world's emissions of methane, which is already escaping in monumental volumes from gas, oil and coal infrastructure, and has a fast warming impact on the planet.\n\nThe leak was found earlier this week and seismologists mentioned they detected explosions on the web site, which in all probability brought about the pipelines to rupture. On Thursday, Sweden's coast guard confirmed a fourth leak within the pipelines. One of its vessels close to the supply of two leaks which can be in Swedish waters is reporting a gentle circulate of gas to the floor.\n\nThere are nonetheless many unknowns round what occurred to the pipelines, which have been used as bargaining chips in the course of the vitality disaster and Russia's struggle in Ukraine. Who is accountable, in addition to geopolitical, economic and security questions, stay unanswered.\n\n\"We're very worried,\" mentioned Zitely Tzompa Sosa, an atmospheric scientist on the Clean Air Task Force (CATF), a local weather non-profit group.\n\nBased on knowledge from Nord Stream AG, the operator of the pipelines, Tzompa Sosa says that that between 100 and 120 kilotons of methane have been in all probability in Nord Stream 1 on the time of the rupture.\n\n\"That would be equivalent to about a third of Germany's total methane emissions from the energy sector in 2020, which is about 5% of Europe's methane emissions from the energy sector,\" Sosa advised CNN, assuming the greenhouse gas entered the ambiance.\n\nQuantifying the leak in the meanwhile is a tough estimate. Nord Stream 1 stopped supplying gas to Europe in July and Nord Stream 2 by no means absolutely opened, making certainty concerning the quantity inconceivable.\n\nOther local weather scientists are much less conservative of their estimates. Although Nord Stream 2 by no means absolutely opened, the pipe has a capability of 200 kilotons.\n\nPaul Balcombe, a lecturer in chemical engineering at Imperial College London, advised CNN that 200 kilotons of gas coming into the ambiance would equate to about 10% of the UK's whole methane emissions.\n\nMethane and CO2 are each greenhouse gases, however they behave in numerous methods. Balcombe advised CNN that methane is a far larger danger to \"near term warming\" than CO2. Although methane solely lasts \"around 10 years in the atmosphere,\" its quick influence is \"much more potent.\"\n\nBut even in the long term, it's nonetheless worse.\n\n\"Over an average of 100 years, it's about 30 times worse than CO2,\" Balcombe advised CNN, referring to methane's warming energy. As governments scramble to scale back their emissions, \"causing these big leaks right now is going to worsen near-term warming.\"\n\nGas leaks are rather more dangerous to the local weather than merely burning gas to be used. The uncooked molecular type through which the methane leaks from the pipes and enters the ambiance is worse than if the gas had been utilized in houses, for instance, for heating.\n\nWhen methane is burned, as an illustration in home kitchens, \"the compounds that are released from the combustion are not as dangerous to the climate as methane itself,\" Tzompa Sosa mentioned.\n\nRowan Emslie, a spokesperson at CATF, mentioned many gas manufacturing factories had \"safety systems\" designed to burn any gas that escaped in a leak, since this is preferable to permitting the uncooked methane to enter the ambiance.\n\n\"It's still CO2 emissions, it's still bad - but it's not nearly so bad,\" Emslie advised CNN.\n\nIt's actually the tempo at which the gas has entered the ambiance that's regarding.\n\n\"The unprecedented aspect is that we don't think we've seen a leak this large, this fast before,\" Emslie mentioned, \"which is why it's so worrying.\"\n\nThe undeniable fact that the Nord Stream leaks occurred underwater complicates understanding additional. Factors as different as the dimensions of the gas bubbles, the focus of methane-eating microbes within the water, and the depth from which the gas traveled upward, can all have an effect on the general environmental influence. Monitoring the emissions may also be tough, as most satellites solely seize methane focus over land, fairly than within the sea.\n\nUnderstanding the total image will \"take a little bit more time - months, potentially years,\" Sosa mentioned.\n\nThe occasion itself could also be over fairly rapidly. Grant Allen, an environmental scientist on the University of Manchester, careworn to CNN this is a \"time-limited event.\"\n\nIf the circulate of gas has been shut off, as Russia has claimed, the tempo at which it's launched will gradual because the strain within the pipes drops. In this case, the ocean won't be \"boiling\" for for much longer.", "source": {"uri": "pehalnews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pehal News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220927165357-01-nord-stream-leak-aerial-092722.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 27, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 42, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7204927109", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-28", "time": "10:17:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-28T10:17:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-28T10:04:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6901960968971252, "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/nord-stream-gas-leaks-raise-climate-fears-but-impact-hard-to-quantify/articleshow/94506910.cms", "title": "Nord Stream gas leaks raise climate fears, but impact hard to quantify - Times of India", "body": "Gas leak at Nord Stream 2 as seen from the Danish F-16 interceptor on Bornholm, Denmark\n\nUnexplained leaks in two Russian gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea are spewing out greenhouse gas emissions, raising fears that the disruption could cause a climate calamity - although to what extent is still unclear.\n\nNeither pipeline was in operation, but both contained natural gas - which is largely composed of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that is the second biggest cause of climate change after CO2.\n\n\"There are a number of uncertainties, but if these pipelines fail, the impact to the climate will be disastrous and could even be unprecedented,\" said atmospheric chemist David McCabe, who is senior scientist at the non-profit Clean Air Task Force.\n\nMcCabe and other emissions experts told Reuters that it was not yet possible to assess the size of the leak, given uncertainties around factors such as the temperature of the gas in the pipeline, how fast it's leaking, and how much gas would be absorbed by microbes in the water before reaching the surface.\n\nBut since both Nord Stream pipelines contained mostly methane, \"the potential for a massive and highly damaging emission event is very worrisome\", McCabe said.\n\nOver a 20-year timeframe, methane has more than 80 times the planet-warming potency of carbon dioxide, and roughly 30 times its potency over 100 years. Scientists say sharp cuts in methane emissions over the next few years will be a vital lever in curbing climate change.\n\nHARD TO QUANTIFY\n\nJasmin Cooper, a research associate at Imperial College London's Sustainable Gas Institute, said it would be difficult to quantify exactly how much gas was reaching the atmosphere - especially given scarce existing data on leaks from subsea pipelines.\n\n\"Gazprom will probably have an estimate based on gas throughputs, but in terms of how much gas/methane is emitted into the atmosphere ... they need to send out a team now to measure and monitor,\" she said, referring to the state-owned Russian gas firm.\n\nMethane leaks from onshore gas leaks can be picked up by a growing network of special satellites, but due to the different reflection of light on water it is challenging to use satellites to analyse offshore leaks, said Christian Lelong, director for climate solutions at satellite data firm Kayrros.\n\nFlyovers with planes or drones could be alternative solutions, analysts said.\n\nA \"conservative estimate\" based on available data suggests the leaks together were releasing more than 500 metric tons of methane per hour when first breached, with the pressure and flow rate decreasing over time, said Jean-Francois Gauthier, vice president of measurements at the commercial methane-measuring satellite firm GHGSat.\n\nBy comparison, the huge Aliso Canyon gas leak in the United States in 2016 spewed around 50 tons of methane per hour at its peak. \"So this would be an order of magnitude more,\" Gauthier said.\n\nA spokesman for Nord Stream 2 - one of the leaking pipelines, which never started operating and was shelved by Germany just before Russia invaded Ukraine - said this week the system held 300 million cubic metres of gas.\n\nReleasing that amount in entirety to the atmosphere would result in around 200,000 tonnes of methane emissions, said chemical engineer Paul Balcombe at London's Queen Mary University.\n\nGerman non-profit Deutsche Umwelthilfe gave a similar estimate of the pipeline's potential emissions.\n\nThat amount of methane would have about the same global warming potential over a 100-year timeframe as about 6 million tons of carbon dioxide, according to Reuters calculations based on IPCC conversion factors. That's roughly on par with the amount of CO2 emitted in an entire year by mid-sized cities such as Havana, or Helsinki or Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThe amount of gas leaking from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline system is less clear, with a pipeline spokesman declining to say how much was left in the system when it was taken offline for maintenance a few weeks ago.\n\nStefano Grassi, head of the European Union energy commissioner's cabinet, said Tuesday that the leaks risked becoming \"a climate and ecological disaster\".\n\n\"We are in contact with [EU member states] to look into what happened and find the fastest way to stop leaks and avoid worse damage,\" Grassi said in a tweet.\n\nEU countries were among more than 100 countries, including the United States, Brazil, Pakistan and Mexico that pledged last year to slash their combined methane emissions by 30% by 2030, in a bid to help stave off disastrous levels of climate change.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL RISK\n\nWhile oil spills can immediately affect and ultimately kill wildlife, authorities say the gas pipeline gas leaks pose a limited threat to the surrounding plant and animal life.\n\nThe German environment ministry said the leaks would not pose a significant threat to marine life, but Greenpeace raised concerns on Tuesday that fish may get caught in plumes of gas, which could interfere with their breathing.\n\nDenmark's Energy Agency told Reuters said it was too early to say who would investigate the Nord Stream 2 leak and no-one has been to look at the pipeline yet.\n\nIt added the leaks will likely continue for several days and perhaps even a week.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-94506937,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-98682,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 19, "stanza_neu": 11, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 30, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7206549130", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-29", "time": "13:22:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-29T13:22:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-29T12:27:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "url": "https://techbizweb.com/nord-stream-gas-leaks-examined-by-scientists-for-climate-damage/", "title": "Nord Stream gas leaks examined by scientists for climate damage | TechBizWeb", "body": "Large volumes of the potent greenhouse gas methane are estimated to be leaking into the atmosphere from damaged European pipelines stretching from Russia to Germany that several EU leaders have said were sabotaged.\n\nWhile the precise volume of methane escaping into the atmosphere from underwater pipelines is difficult for scientists to quantify with certainty, experts say the amount estimated to be coming from four leaks detected in the Nord Stream pipelines is likely to be significant.\n\nIf only one of the two leaking pipes were to release all their contents, it would represent about twice as much methane as was emitted during the 2015 Aliso Canyon leak from underground storage in California, one of the worst ever recorded, said Paul Balcombe, honorary lecturer at Imperial College London in chemical engineering.\n\nMethane is the main component in gas and is a key driver of climate change. The molecule traps more heat over a shorter time period than carbon dioxide, giving it about 80 times the warming potential of carbon over 20 years.\n\nIt behaves differently when released into seawater than directly into the atmosphere. Some of the methane that leaked would be dissolved in the ocean, although the huge surface bubbles in the Baltic Sea indicated that much was rising to the surface and escaping into the atmosphere.\n\n\"It's a pretty big deal,\" said Balcombe, noting the leaks \"all look pretty big, they're showing quite a wide diameter.\"\n\nThe German environment agency estimated on Wednesday that the leaks would release 300,000 tonnes of methane into the atmosphere.\n\nBy comparison, the Aliso leak emitted around 100,000 tonnes of methane into the atmosphere between October 2015 and February 2016.\n\nAnnual global methane emissions are around 570mn tonnes, the International Energy Agency estimates, making the Nordstream leak potentially a fraction of the overall amount while highlighting the risks.\n\n\"It's impossible to pin a number on [the Nord Stream leaks] right now,\" but they \"could be as significant as [Aliso],\" said Balcombe. However, he said that it was unlikely that the pipes would release their entire contents.\n\nJean-Francois Gauthier, vice-president of measurements and strategic initiatives at the global emissions modelling service, GHGSat, said that \"by any measure, this is a catastrophic level.\"\n\n\"It is especially unusual to see over such a short period of time, and the likely environmental impact will be similar to at least 1mn cars on the road for a full year,\" Gauthier said.\n\nGrant Allen, professor of atmospheric physics at the University of Manchester, said the impact of the disaster for the climate would be limited by the fact that the pipelines were not in operation even if they still contained gas, which would reduce the amount that escaped.\n\nOcean bacteria can break down methane using oxygen, a process that produces carbon dioxide which dissolves in the water. Although the world's oceans absorb carbon emissions, the volume they are taking in as a result of the build up of greenhouse gases is causing them to acidify.\n\nSatellite imagery services that can identify and quantify methane leaks have encountered difficulties in analysing the Nord Stream leaks due to cloud cover. Erik Arends, from the SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research, said that assessing the damage was challenging because the water did not reflect enough sunlight to produce useful images.\n\nGiant bubbles of gas were first spotted in the Baltic Sea on Monday, which led to the discovery of leaks in two Nord Stream pipelines, located in international waters just off the Danish island of Bornholm.\n\nThe discovery has fuelled speculation about vandalism by Russia, which the Kremlin has denied, and intensified discussions about the need to secure Europe's energy networks.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said on Tuesday that \"sabotage action\" had taken place and \"any deliberate disruption of active European energy infrastructure is unacceptable and will lead to the strongest possible response\".\n\nThe cause of the leaks remains unknown, though an official investigation has been announced by Denmark and Sweden.\n\nThe issue is due to be discussed at a meeting of EU energy ministers in Brussels on Friday.\n\n\"I believe everybody around the table is deeply concerned about this matter. Safety and environmental concerns are an utmost priority for all of us\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. We all agree that we need to support investigation and get full clarity on this,\" said a senior EU diplomat.\n\nJeffrey Kargel, from the Planetary Research Institute in Arizona, said the damage was \"really disturbing,\" and amounted to \"an environmental crime if it was deliberate.\"", "source": {"uri": "techbizweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechBizWeb"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://techbizweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/57d09978-0e9c-4aba-8aa6-b19a5a970b32.png", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 16, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 29, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7206759949", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-29", "time": "16:09:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-29T16:09:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-29T16:09:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "url": "https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/09/29/climate-scientist-demands-war-crimes-charges-whoever-ordered-pipeline-sabotage", "title": "Climate Scientist Demands 'War Crimes' Charges for Whoever Ordered Pipeline Sabotage", "body": "The call from Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson came as a fourth Nord Stream leak was discovered, intensifying fears of an unprecedented release of planet-heating methane emissions.\n\nA Stanford University climate scientist on Wednesday called for war crimes charges against whoever is found to have ordered the apparent sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline system, an incident that experts say could result in the largest-ever recorded release of methane emissions.\n\n\"Whoever ordered this should be prosecuted for war crimes and go to jail,\" Stanford's Rob Jackson told the Associated Press as scientists assessed the potentially massive environmental impact of the pipeline damage, which European countries and NATO have formally concluded is the result of a deliberate attack.\n\n\"This is a colossal amount of gas, in really large bubbles.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Swedish authorities announced the discovery of a fourth leak in the Nord Stream pipeline network that carries Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea, adding to the three leaks found earlier this week.

If the gas-air mix was within a certain range, an airplane could easily ignite travelling into the plume, for example.\n\nMethane isn't the only risk. \"Natural gas isn't refined to be super clean -- there are trace elements of other compounds, like benzene,\" a carcinogen, said Leifer.\n\n\"The amount of these trace elements cumulatively entering the environment is significant right now -- this will cause issues for fisheries and marine ecosystems and people who potentially eat those fish,\" he said.\n\nDavid Archer, a professor in the geophysical sciences department at University of Chicago who focuses on the global carbon cycle, said that escape of methane in the Baltic Sea is part of the much larger worldwide problem of methane emissions.\n\nThe gas is a major contributor to climate change, responsible for a significant share of the climate disruption people are already experiencing. That is because it is 82.5 times more potent than carbon dioxide at absorbing the sun's heat and warming the Earth, over the short term.\n\nClimate scientist have found that methane emissions from the oil and gas industry are far worse than what companies are reporting, despite claims by major companies that they've reduced their emissions.\n\nScientists measuring methane from satellites in space have found that emissions from oil and gas operations are usually at least twice as high as what the companies reported, said Thomas Lauvaux, climate scientist at University of Reims in France.\n\nMany of those so-called leaks are not accidental. Companies release the gas during routine maintenance. Lauvaux and other scientists observed more than 1,500 major methane leaks globally, and potentially tens of thousands of smaller leaks, using satellites, he said.\n\n--\n\nAP reporters Patrick Whittle contributed from Portland, Maine, Seth Borenstein from Washington, DC., and Cathy Bussewitz from New York.\n\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Their argument: burning natural gas emits half as much carbon per kilowatt as coal.\n\nBut factor in gas industry leaks from drill pads, pipelines, compressors, and other infrastructure, and those gains can quickly be erased.\n\n\"There's a break-even point in how much methane is leaked for ... natural gas (to be) actually worse than coal for the climate,\" said Sam Abernethy, co-author of the February study.\n\nWorld governments, including the United States, are introducing requirements that the oil and gas industry detect and repair leaks after studies showed leaks in the industry were a huge problem.\n\nThe European Union recently endorsed labeling some natural gas projects as \"green\" in a major boost to the industry.\n\n(Reporting by Tim Cocks in Johannesburg; editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "source": {"uri": "insurancejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Insurance Journal"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/app/uploads/2022/09/russia-pipeline-gas-leaks-AP-580x386.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 14, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 28, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7204864077", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-28", "time": "09:27:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-28T09:27:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-28T09:27:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/nord-stream-gas-leaks-could-be-unprecedented-climate-disaster-1.1824836", "title": "Nord Stream Gas Leaks Could Be 'Unprecedented' Climate Disaster -  BNN Bloomberg", "body": "(Bloomberg) -- The 700-meter wide pool of bubbling water in the Baltic Sea caused by the rupture of the Nord Stream gas pipelines points to a climate disaster.\n\nIt's the most visible of three major gas leaks emanating from the pipelines connecting Russia to Germany. Scientists are scrambling to work out just how much methane, one of the most powerful greenhouse gases, has escaped into the atmosphere. The fear is that it could be one of the worst releases ever.\n\nThe cause of the three near-simultaneous pipeline ruptures hasn't been confirmed, but German and US officials said the incident looked like sabotage. Suspicion has fallen on Russia, which has squeezed the amount of energy flowing to Europe since it decided to invade Ukraine.\n\nWhile the Nord Stream 1 pipelines were halted -- and Nordstream 2 had never even started -- they all contained pressurized natural gas, the vast majority of which is methane.\n\n\"Given that, over twenty years, a ton of methane has a climate impact more than 80 times that of CO2, the potential for a massive and highly damaging emission event is very worrisome,\" said David McCabe, senior scientist at Clean Air Task Force, a climate nonprofit. \"There are a number of uncertainties but, if these pipelines fail, the impact to the climate will be disastrous and could even be unprecedented.\"\n\nEstimating the precise amount of methane that has escaped into the atmosphere is an extremely challenging task. Many so-called super-emitting events -- large continuous discharges of methane -- are captured by satellite imagery over land-based pipelines or fossil-fuel production sites. But capturing accurate data over water, is far more challenging given the light that reflects of the surface.\n\nRead this QuickTake on the impact of methane on the atmosphere\n\nThere are a number of other key uncertainties -- how much gas was in the pipelines at the time, what temperature and pressure it was being held at, and just how big the size of the rupture in the pipes was. Even when the gas escapes, some is likely to have dissipated into the water, but that also depends on the density of microbial life, as well as the depth. To obtain accurate readings, a plane would probably have to take measurements from the air.\n\nDespite that, scientists on social media were quick to do some back-of-the envelope calculations into just how much methane might have escaped. Andrew Baxter, director of energy strategy at the Environmental Defense Fund, estimated that around 115,000 tons of methane escaped, equivalent to around 9.6 million tons of Carbon Dioxide. In real terms, that's the same climate impact as the emissions from 2 million gasoline cars over the course of a year, or two-and-a-half coal-fired power stations.\n\nIf that's close to being accurate, it would be one of the biggest methane leaks ever. The biggest known release in the US, happened at gas storage facility in Aliso Canyon, Los Angeles, in 2015, where an estimated 97,100 metric tons of methane was emitted over several months. By comparison, the Nord Stream leaks may have happened over the course of several hours.\n\nThe expulsion of methane, comes amid growing public consciousness of its effects on the climate. At the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, over 100 countries pledged to drastically curb emissions. The European Union is also in the process of legislation that would raise the obligation on companies to reduce flaring of the gas, conduct regular inspections to stem leaks and boost transparency of leaks associated with imports.\n\nAt an event in the European Parliament Tuesday evening to launch \"methane week,\" lawmakers, scientists and environmentalists discussed how to measure the scale of the leak, but were united on one thing -- it is likely to be an environmental disaster. The Green group's co-lead negotiator for the bloc's methane regulation, Jutta Paulus, pointed the finger firmly toward Russia, coming the same week as the Baltic Pipeline -- connecting Norway to Poland -- was opened.\n\n\"'I don't think it's a coincidence that this is happened on the day the Baltic pipeline was opened,\" Paulus said at the event. President Vladimir Putin is telling us \"be sure you know what you're doing when you're applying more sanctions on us. We have to use all possibilities to apply energy efficiency and ramp up renewables.\"", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/img/tsn/logos/tsn-logo.png", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 11, "stanza_neu": 18, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 31, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7206314299", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-29", "time": "10:16:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-29T10:16:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-29T10:15:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "url": "https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2022/09/29/leaks-in-nord-stream-gas-pipelines-create-risk-of-climate-bomb_5998552_4.html", "title": "Leaks in Nord Stream gas pipelines create risk of 'climate bomb'", "body": "The photos and videos have made the rounds of the mainstream and social media. They show patches of bubbles on the surface of the Baltic Sea, ranging from 200 meters to one kilometer in diameter. The cause is massive leaks in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines off the coast of Denmark, possibly due to sabotage. They raise fears of a \"climate and ecological disaster,\" according to Stefano Grassi, Head of Cabinet of the European Commissioner for Energy, Tuesday, September 27. \"There are a number of uncertainties, but if these pipelines fail, the impact on the climate will be disastrous and could even be unprecedented,\" said David McCabe, a senior scientist with the Clean Air Task Force think tank, in a press release.\n\nThe reason for the concern is that the pipelines, even though they were not operational, contain natural gas for technical reasons that is mainly composed of methane, a very powerful greenhouse gas. Its warming potential is much higher than that of carbon dioxide (CO) - 82 times more over a 20-year timeline, 29 times more over a hundred years. Methane is responsible for a quarter of global warming since the pre-industrial era, and its emissions have increased sharply in recent years.\n\nIf all the gas were to escape, the emissions would be equivalent to one third to one half of Denmark's annual emissions\n\nHow much methane was released into the atmosphere? This is difficult to estimate, as it depends on the pressure or temperature of the gas in the pipelines and how much has dissolved in water. \"Half the gas is already out of one of the two pipes,\" head of the Danish Energy Agency Kristoffer B\u00f6ttzauw said at a press conference on Wednesday, adding that the agency expects the rest to be out by Sunday. The German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection estimated that 300,000 tons of methane have been released into the atmosphere.\n\nAccording to various scientists, gas pipelines contain between 300 and 500 million cubic meters (m) of gas, or between 200,000 and 300,000 metric tons of methane. This amount has the same warming power over a 20-year period as 17 to 25 million metric tons of CO. If all the gas escaped, the emissions would be equivalent to one-third to one-half of Denmark's annual emissions, or 4-7% of France's emissions. \"The impact would be similar to that of a million cars for a year, which is colossal,\" added Thomas Lauvaux, a researcher at the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://img.lemde.fr/2022/09/27/143/0/2800/1400/1440/720/60/0/4174f92_5304499-01-06.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 6, "stanza_neu": 9, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 17, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7206761703", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-29", "time": "16:10:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-29T16:10:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-29T15:53:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "url": "https://www.rawstory.com/climate-scientist-demands-war-crimes-charges-for-whoever-ordered-pipeline-sabotage/", "title": "Climate scientist demands 'war crimes' charges for whoever ordered pipeline sabotage", "body": "A Stanford University climate scientist on Wednesday called for war crimes charges against whoever is found to have ordered the apparent sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline system, an incident that experts say could result in the largest-ever recorded release of methane emissions.\n\n\"Whoever ordered this should be prosecuted for war crimes and go to jail,\" Stanford's Rob Jackson told the Associated Press as scientists assessed the potentially massive environmental impact of the pipeline damage, which European countries and NATO have formally concluded is the result of a deliberate attack.\n\n\"This is a colossal amount of gas, in really large bubbles.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Swedish authorities announced the discovery of a fourth leak in the Nord Stream pipeline network that carries Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea, adding to the three leaks found earlier this week.

pipelines still contained gas, and Danish authorities said they will now likely continue to empty out, with leaks expected to continue for at least a week.\n\nWith only rough estimates available as to how much natural gas might bubble up through the Baltic Sea, scientists expressed concerns about climate and environmental impacts -- but stressed that the amounts of methane involved were a tiny fraction of global emissions.\n\n\"It is a real travesty, an environmental crime if it was deliberate,\" said Jeffrey Kargel, senior scientist at the Planetary Research Institute in Arizona, calling the leak \"disturbing\".\n\nBut he added: \"Although the amount of gas lost from the pipeline obviously is large, it is not the climate disaster one might think.\"\n\nThis is about 28 times more powerful than carbon dioxide on a century-long timescale -- although it only lingers in the atmosphere for about a decade, compared to hundreds or thousands of years for C02.\n\nSome of the methane emitted from the pipes will be oxidised in the water into C02, said Grant Allen, professor of Atmospheric Physics at the University of Manchester.\n\n\"But given how violent the venting of natural gas appears to be, most of the gas will reach the sea surface as methane,\" he said.\n\nMethane is responsible for roughly 30 percent of the global rise in temperatures to date, even though it is far less abundant in the atmosphere than CO2.\n\nHow big is the leak?\n\nThis is the subject of much uncertainty, although some experts and organisations have attempted to calculate the potential amount of gas in the pipelines.\n\nOne estimate is that there was up to 177 million cubic metres of natural gas still in Nord Stream 2, said Allen.\n\n\"This is not a small amount of gas, and represents a reckless emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,\" he said, adding it was equivalent to the natural gas used by 124,000 UK homes in a year.\n\nGreenpeace have used similar figures to roughly estimate that the leak emissions could be equivalent to eight months of Denmark's total greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nPaul Balcombe, an honorary lecturer at the Department of Chemical Engineering at Imperial College London, said estimates for the gas in the pipes range from around 150 to 300 million cubic metres.\n\n\"It is unlikely that they will release all their contents,\" he told the Science Media Centre.\n\nBut he added if just one of the pipes did completely empty out it would be about twice as much as the worst methane leak recorded in the United States, the 2015 Aliso Canyon leak.\n\n\"It would have a very large environmental and climate impact indeed, even if it released a fraction of this,\" he said.\n\nLauri Myllyvirta from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air said he has calculated an estimated potential leak of between 180 and 270 kilotons from the two pipelines.\n\nThis figure is significant but, he said, is probably only 1.5 percent of the total annual methane emissions from oil and gas operations in Russia.\n\nThe International Energy Agency estimates this was some 18 million tonnes in 2021.\n\nHow does it compare to global emissions?\n\nThe IEA has decried the enormous amount of methane that leaks from fossil fuel operations every year -- estimating the amount lost last year globally was broadly similar to all the gas used in Europe's power sector.\n\nThe leak will certainly have a \"strong immediate warming effect and cause poor air quality\" Piers Forster, director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate at the University of Leeds.\n\nBut ultimately its effect is small compared to the daily leaks from the world's poorly-maintained gas networks, which see around 10 percent of global gas supply lost.\n\nExperts said the incident further underscores the need to urgently switch from polluting fossil fuels, both to combat climate change and ensure energy security.\n\nThis year's energy crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine has already \"supercharged the clean energy transition\", Myllyvirta said.\n\nKargel, who calculated that the Nord Stream leak was roughly equivalent to 2.5 hours of global emissions, said it was a reminder of the urgent need to slash greenhouse emissions.\n\n\"The global climate is changing drastically, with huge impacts on extreme climate mounting every year, decade after decade,\" he

(AP) -- Methane escaping from the damaged Nord Stream pipelines that run between Russia and Europe is likely to result in the biggest known gas leak to take place over a short period of time and highlights the problem of large methane escapes elsewhere around the world, scientists say.\n\nThere is still uncertainty in estimating total damage, but researchers say vast plumes of this potent greenhouse gas will have significant detrimental impacts on the climate.\n\nImmediate harm to marine life and fisheries in the Baltic Sea and to human health will also result because benzene and other trace chemicals are typically present in natural gas, researchers say.\n\n\"This will probably be the biggest gas leak ever, in terms of its rate,\" said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson.\n\nThe velocity of the gas erupting from four documented leaks in the pipelines -- which the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has attributed to sabotage -- is part of what makes the impacts severe.\n\nWhen methane leaks naturally leaks from vents on the ocean floor, the quantities are usually small and the gas is mostly absorbed by seawater. \"But this is not a normal situation for gas release,\" said Jackson. \"We're not talking about methane bubbling up to the surface like seltzer water, but a plume of rushing gas,\" he said.\n\nJackson and other scientists estimate that between 50% and nearly 100% of total methane emitted from the pipeline will reach the atmosphere.\n\nThe Danish government issued a worst case scenario that assumed all the gas reached the air, and German officials Thursday issued a somewhat lower one.\n\nIn the meantime, it's nearly impossible for anyone to approach the highly flammable plume to attempt to curb the release of gas, which energy experts estimate may continue until Sunday.\n\n\"Methane is very flammable -- if you go in there, you'd have a good chance of it being a funeral pyre,\" said Ira Leifer, an atmospheric scientist. If the gas-air mix was within a certain range, an airplane could easily ignite travelling into the plume, for example.\n\nMethane isn't the only risk. \"Natural gas isn't refined to be super clean -- there are trace elements of other compounds, like benzene,\" a carcinogen, said Leifer.\n\n\"The amount of these trace elements cumulatively entering the environment is significant right now -- this will cause issues for fisheries and marine ecosystems and people who potentially eat those fish,\" he said.\n\nDavid Archer, a professor in the geophysical sciences department at University of Chicago who focuses on the global carbon cycle, said that escape of methane in the Baltic Sea is part of the much larger worldwide problem of methane emissions.\n\nThe gas is a major contributor to climate change, responsible for a significant share of the climate disruption people are already experiencing. That is because it is 82.5 times more potent than carbon dioxide at absorbing the sun's heat and warming the Earth, over the short term.\n\nClimate scientist have found that methane emissions from the oil and gas industry are far worse than what companies are reporting, despite claims by major companies that they've reduced their emissions.\n\nScientists measuring methane from satellites in space have found that emissions from oil and gas operations are usually at least twice as high as what the companies reported, said Thomas Lauvaux, climate scientist at University of Reims in France.\n\nMany of those so-called leaks are not accidental. Companies release the gas during routine maintenance. Lauvaux and other scientists observed more than 1,500 major methane leaks globally, and potentially tens of thousands of smaller leaks, using satellites, he said.\n\n--\n\nAP reporters Patrick Whittle contributed from Portland, Maine, Seth Borenstein from Washington, DC., and Cathy Bussewitz from New York.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

There are at least four leaks, though, with the fourth just discovered by Sweden. Nord Stream 2 may have contained 300 million cubic meters of gas before the project was stopped by Germany days before Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n\"It has the potential to be one of the biggest gas leaks,\" Jasmin Cooper, a research associate at Imperial College London's Department of Chemical Engineering, told The Guardian. \"The climate risks from the methane leak are quite large. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, 30 times stronger than CO2 over 100 years and more than 80 times stronger over 20 years.\"\n\nWhile this leak will not have an impact on marine life the way an oil spill does, the vast volume of natural gas leaking could be devastating for the atmosphere. According to the Danish Energy Agency, over half the gas in the pipes has leaked, and the rest of the gas is expected to emit into the atmosphere by Sunday, October 2.\n\nIf 250,000 metric tons of methane leak from the pipes, it could have a climate impact equivalent to 1.3 million cars driving on roads for one year.", "source": {"uri": "ecowatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EcoWatch"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.ecowatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gas-leak.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 6, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 21, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7207012892", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-29", "time": "20:28:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-29T20:28:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-29T20:19:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6509804129600525, "url": "https://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Baltic-Sea-pipeline-leak-damages-marine-life-and-17476226.php", "title": "Baltic Sea pipeline leak damages marine life and climate", "body": "Immediate harm to marine life and fisheries in the Baltic Sea and to human health will also result because benzene and other trace chemicals are typically present in natural gas, researchers say.\n\n\"This will probably be the biggest gas leak ever, in terms of its rate,\" said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson.\n\nThe velocity of the gas erupting from four documented leaks in the pipelines -- which the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has attributed to sabotage -- is part of what makes the impacts severe.\n\nWhen methane leaks naturally leaks from vents on the ocean floor, the quantities are usually small and the gas is mostly absorbed by seawater. \"But this is not a normal situation for gas release,\" said Jackson. \"We're not talking about methane bubbling up to the surface like seltzer water, but a plume of rushing gas,\" he said.\n\nJackson and other scientists estimate that between 50% and nearly 100% of total methane emitted from the pipeline will reach the atmosphere.\n\nThe Danish government issued a worst case scenario that assumed all the gas reached the air, and German officials Thursday issued a somewhat lower one.\n\nIn the meantime, it's nearly impossible for anyone to approach the highly flammable plume to attempt to curb the release of gas, which energy experts estimate may continue until Sunday.\n\n\"Methane is very flammable -- if you go in there, you'd have a good chance of it being a funeral pyre,\" said Ira Leifer, an atmospheric scientist. If the gas-air mix was within a certain range, an airplane could easily ignite travelling into the plume, for example.\n\nMethane isn't the only risk. \"Natural gas isn't refined to be super clean -- there are trace elements of other compounds, like benzene,\" a carcinogen, said Leifer.\n\n\"The amount of these trace elements cumulatively entering the environment is significant right now -- this will cause issues for fisheries and marine ecosystems and people who potentially eat those fish,\" he said.\n\nDavid Archer, a professor in the geophysical sciences department at University of Chicago who focuses on the global carbon cycle, said that escape of methane in the Baltic Sea is part of the much larger worldwide problem of methane emissions.\n\nThe gas is a major contributor to climate change, responsible for a significant share of the climate disruption people are already experiencing. That is because it is 82.5 times more potent than carbon dioxide at absorbing the sun's heat and warming the Earth, over the short term.\n\nClimate scientist have found that methane emissions from the oil and gas industry are far worse than what companies are reporting, despite claims by major companies that they've reduced their emissions.\n\nScientists measuring methane from satellites in space have found that emissions from oil and gas operations are usually at least twice as high as what the companies reported, said Thomas Lauvaux, climate scientist at University of Reims in France.\n\nMany of those so-called leaks are not accidental. Companies release the gas during routine maintenance. Lauvaux and other scientists observed more than 1,500 major methane leaks globally, and potentially tens of thousands of smaller leaks, using satellites, he said.\n\n--\n\nAP reporters Patrick Whittle contributed from Portland, Maine, Seth Borenstein from Washington, DC., and Cathy Bussewitz from New York.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Given the short-term potency of methane, cost-effective interventions to reduce methane emissions are an immediate priority.\n\nWe have a long record of engagement on methane emissions reduction across the sectors with largest emissions, such as agriculture, energy, and sanitation and waste. We have recently added a repository on our website with examples of our work in this area.\n\nFor instance, in Nigeria, Peru, South Africa, and Vietnam, we are helping clients monitor short-lived climate pollutants linked to smog, an activity that also has tremendous long term health impacts on people of all ages, but particularly the young and infirm.\n\nIn the energy sector, for the last seven years our Global Gas Flaring program has been working to help 16 governments and 13 major energy companies understand how venting and flaring costs them money and imposes a huge environmental burden.\n\nI'd like to describe our plans for deepening our engagement on methane, short lived climate pollutants, and deforestation for a fast mitigation sprint.\n\nWe will do this, first, by scaling up our own operations, including by engaging with clients more systematically on fast mitigation issues.\n\nAs an example, when we recently met the President of a South American country with a large agricultural sector, our senior management specifically engaged with him on what he could do to reduce agriculture related methane emissions. We will consistently bring this approach to our interactions with our clients, to focus on what are the cost-effective ways for them to reduce methane emissions, and the role the private and public sectors can play.\n\nOur new Country Climate and Development Reports (CCDRs) will help us make sure our work in this area is systematic.\n\nCCDRs are one of the most transformative ways in which we are comprehensively assessing the links between climate change and a country's future development trajectory. CCDRs have both a sectoral and whole-of-economy approach, meaning they can cover a lot of territory, including methane.\n\nIn the CCDR for Vietnam, for instance, we note that more than a third of the country's emissions come from non-CO2 gases, most notably methane. The report points out that pursuing alternating wetting and drying approach, rather than simply flooding rice fields, can virtually eliminate methane production from those fields. Cost effective measures such as this one can reduce emissions, decrease production cost, and provide higher income for farmers - a triple win.\n\nGoing forward, we're committing to consistently covering fast mitigation issues in our CCDRs.\n\nSecond, we've begun talking to a range of donors about increasing financial support. These resources will help us:\n\nProvide more analytic support and build a deeper understanding of what it will take to advance fast mitigation in different sectors.\n\nBetter understand what has worked and what hasn't; and help scale up solutions.\n\nFinally, tackling methane effectively will require wider engagement with partners, including other Development Finance Institutions and the private sector. Working with a wide range of stakeholders means:\n\nMore consistent sharing of information on the fast mitigation work each of us is doing in client countries and with key private sector clients;\n\nPossible joint engagements on fast mitigation projects with both public and private clients; and\n\nA better understanding of how voluntary carbon markets and results-based financing can be used to support fast mitigation activities.\n\nWe look forward to sharing more on this in coming weeks.\n\nLet me conclude by saying that the World Bank Group has the track record, convening power, and expertise to lead a global effort to expand the amount of finance targeting fast mitigation activities.\n\nTaking on this challenge is crucial for the climate and the well-being of the planet.", "source": {"uri": "worldbank.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Bank"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/share-logo/social-share.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 20, "stanza_pos": 6, "swn_neg": 30, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 2, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7204905717", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-28", "time": "10:01:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-28T10:01:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-28T09:53:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "url": "https://science.thewire.in/environment/nord-stream-methane-leak/", "title": "Nord Stream Gas Leaks Raise Climate Fears, but Impact Hard To Quantify", "body": "The gas leak at Nord Stream 2 as seen from a Danish F-16 interceptor at Bornholm, Denmark, September 27, 2022. Photo: Danish Defence Command/Reuters\n\nUnexplained leaks in two Russian gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea are spewing out greenhouse gases, raising fears that the disruption could cause a climate calamity - although to what extent is still unclear.\n\nNeither pipeline was in operation, but both contained natural gas - which is largely composed of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that is the second biggest cause of climate change after carbon dioxide.\n\n\"There are a number of uncertainties, but if these pipelines fail, the impact to the climate will be disastrous and could even be unprecedented,\" said atmospheric chemist David McCabe, who is senior scientist at the non-profit Clean Air Task Force.\n\nMcCabe and other emissions experts told Reuters that it was not yet possible to assess the size of the leak, given uncertainties around factors such as the temperature of the gas in the pipeline, how fast it's leaking, and how much gas would be absorbed by microbes in the water before reaching the surface.\n\nBut since both Nord Stream pipelines contained mostly methane, \"the potential for a massive and highly damaging emission event is very worrisome\", McCabe said.\n\nOver a 20-year timeframe, methane has more than 80 times the planet-warming potency of carbon dioxide, and roughly 30 times its potency over 100 years. Scientists say sharp cuts in methane emissions over the next few years will be a vital lever in curbing climate change.\n\nHard to quantify\n\nJasmin Cooper, a research associate at Imperial College London's Sustainable Gas Institute, said it would be difficult to quantify exactly how much gas was reaching the atmosphere - especially given scarce existing data on leaks from subsea pipelines.\n\n\"Gazprom will probably have an estimate based on gas throughputs, but in terms of how much gas/methane is emitted into the atmosphere ... they need to send out a team now to measure and monitor,\" she said, referring to the state-owned Russian gas firm.\n\nMethane leaks from onshore gas leaks can be picked up by a growing network of special satellites, but due to the different reflection of light on water it is challenging to use satellites to analyse offshore leaks, said Christian Lelong, director for climate solutions at satellite data firm Kayrros.\n\nFlyovers with planes or drones could be alternative solutions, analysts said.\n\nA \"conservative estimate\" based on available data suggests the leaks together were releasing more than 500 metric tons of methane per hour when first breached, with the pressure and flow rate decreasing over time, said Jean-Francois Gauthier, vice president of measurements at the commercial methane-measuring satellite firm GHGSat.\n\nBy comparison, the huge Aliso Canyon gas leak in the United States in 2016 spewed around 50 tons of methane per hour at its peak. \"So this would be an order of magnitude more,\" Gauthier said.\n\nA spokesman for Nord Stream 2 - one of the leaking pipelines, which never started operating and was shelved by Germany just before Russia invaded Ukraine - said this week the system held 300 million cubic metres of gas.\n\nReleasing that amount in entirety to the atmosphere would result in around 200,000 tonnes of methane emissions, said chemical engineer Paul Balcombe at London's Queen Mary University.\n\nGerman non-profit Deutsche Umwelthilfe gave a similar estimate of the pipeline's potential emissions.\n\nThat amount of methane would have about the same global warming potential over a 100-year timeframe as about 6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, according to Reuters calculations based on IPCC conversion factors. That's roughly on par with the amount of CO2 emitted in an entire year by mid-sized cities such as Havana, or Helsinki or Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThe amount of gas leaking from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline system is less clear, with a pipeline spokesman declining to say how much was left in the system when it was taken offline for maintenance a few weeks ago.\n\nStefano Grassi, head of the European Union energy commissioner's cabinet, said Tuesday that the leaks risked becoming \"a climate and ecological disaster\".\n\n\"We are in contact with [EU member states] to look into what happened and find the fastest way to stop leaks and avoid worse damage,\" Grassi said in a tweet.\n\nEU countries were among more than 100 countries, including the United States, Brazil, Pakistan and Mexico that pledged last year to slash their combined methane emissions by 30% by 2030, in a bid to help stave off disastrous levels of climate change.\n\nEnvironmental risk\n\nWhile oil spills can immediately affect and ultimately kill wildlife, authorities say the gas pipeline gas leaks pose a limited threat to the surrounding plant and animal life.\n\nThe German environment ministry said the leaks would not pose a significant threat to marine life, but Greenpeace raised concerns on Tuesday that fish may get caught in plumes of gas, which could interfere with their breathing.\n\nDenmark's Energy Agency told Reuters said it was too early to say who would investigate the Nord Stream 2 leak and no-one has been to look at the pipeline yet.\n\nIt added the leaks will likely continue for several days and perhaps even a week.\n\n(Reuters - reporting by Kate Abnett, Shadia Nasralla, Rachel More, Thomas Escritt; editing by Katy Daigle and Aurora Ellis)", "source": {"uri": "science.thewire.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wire Science"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/28151809/2022-09-27T214923Z_2_LYNXMPEI8Q117_RTROPTP_4_UKRAINE-CRISIS-DENMARK-REGULATOR-740x493.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 19, "stanza_neu": 13, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 32, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7207267172", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-30", "time": "03:03:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-30T03:03:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-30T03:02:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6392157077789307, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/satellites-capture-first-images-of-nord-stream-s-methane-leaks-1.1826002", "title": "Satellites Capture First Images of Nord Stream's Methane Leaks - BNN Bloomberg", "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Satellite analysis has revealed the first images of the massive methane plumes triggered by the recent explosions on the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe United Nations' International Methane Emissions Observatory said on Twitter that analysis conducted with researchers from Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia detected methane plumes from Nord Stream that are substantially larger than those identified in a so-called super-emitter event in the Gulf of Mexico last year.

Already as subscriber, sign in.\n\nA large disturbance in the sea can be observed off the coast of the Danish island of Bornholm on Tuesday following a series of unusual leaks on two natural gas pipelines running from Russia under the Baltic Sea to Germany. Danish Defence Command via Associated Press\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Methane leaking from the damaged Nord Stream pipelines is likely to be the biggest burst of the potent greenhouse gas on record, by far.\n\nThe Nord Stream pipeline leaks that were pumping huge volumes of methane into the Baltic Sea and atmosphere could discharge as much as five times as much of the potent greenhouse as was released by the Aliso Canyon disaster, the largest known terrestrial release of methane in U.S. history. It is also the equivalent of one-third of Denmark's total annual greenhouse gas emissions, a Danish official warned Wednesday.\n\n\"Whoever ordered this should be prosecuted for war crimes and go to jail,\" said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist. Two scientists looked at the official worst-case scenario estimates provided by the Danish government - 778 million cubic meters of gas - for the Associated Press. They calculated that would be an equivalent of roughly half a million metric tons of methane. The Aliso Canyon disaster released 90-100,000 metric tons.\n\nAndrew Baxter, a chemical engineer who formerly worked in the offshore oil and gas industry and is now at the environmental group EDF, thought the Danish estimate was likely too high. He had a more conservative estimate. But it was still more than double the Aliso Canyon disaster.\n\n\"That's one thing that is consistent with these estimates,\" he said, \"It's catastrophic for the climate.\"\n\nKristoffer B\u00f6ttzauw, head of the Danish Energy Agency, said emissions from the three leaks on the underwater Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines correspond to approximately 32 percent of annual Danish carbon dioxide emissions. Danish emissions in 2020 were approximately 45 million tonnes of CO2.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSabotage was suspected to have caused the leaks, and seismologists said Tuesday that explosions rattled the Baltic Sea before they were discovered. Some European officials and energy experts have said Russia is likely to blame since it directly benefits from higher energy prices and economic anxiety across Europe. But others cautioned against pointing fingers until investigators are able to determine what happened.\n\nMethane seen bubbling at the ocean surface was an indication of \"a strong upward flow,\" according to Paul Balcombe, a member of the engineering faculty at the department of chemical engineering at Imperial College London.\n\nThe loss of pressure in the pipe likely meant a large amount of gas was already lost, he said. The impacts of the gas leak are still coming into focus, Balcombe said, but are likely to be significant.\n\n\"It would have a very large environmental and climate impact indeed, even if it released a fraction of this,\" he said.\n\nMethane is a major contributor to climate change, responsible for a significant share of the climate disruption people are already experiencing. That is because it is 82.5 times more potent than carbon dioxide at absorbing the sun's heat and warming the Earth.\n\nB\u00f6ttzauw, told a press conference that the agency expects the gas to be out of the pipes, that run from Russia to Germany, by Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We believe that half the gas is out by now of one of the two pipes,\" B\u00f6ttzauw said. \"We are talking about a huge spill of several million cubic meters of gas.\"\n\nThe Danish agency statement added that its calculation was based on information from operators Nord Stream AG and Nord Stream 2 AG about the content of natural gas in the three pipelines that are leaking.\n\nThe incidents come as the EU struggles to keep a lid on soaring gas and electricity prices.\n\n\"As long as there is gas, it dangerous to be there,\" B\u00f6ttzauw said, declining to say when experts would be able to go down and see the pipes, which he said was made of 5-inch-thick steel coated with concrete. They lie on the seabed between 230 feet and 295 feet deep.\n\nThe leaks all were in international waters. Two were within the Danish exclusive economic zone while the third is in the Swedish equivalent.\n\nRelated Headlines Blasts precede Baltic pipeline leaks, sabotage seen likely\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

On Tuesday, Swedish seismologists reported a number of explosions around the pipelines between Russia and mainland Europe.\n\nThe leaks found were met international uproar. European leaders say they were a result of sabotage, though no concrete evidence has been found yet.\n\nWeir added that deliberate attacks to commodities are not new.\n\n\"The deliberate weaponization of the environment in conflict settings does happen.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nLeaks in two natural gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea have sparked concern over the potential impact of escaping gas on the climate.\n\nThe pipelines that run underwater from Russia to Germany carry natural gas - the main component of which is methane, a powerful contributor to global heating.\n\nLeaks were discovered in the pipelines on Tuesday after seismologists reported explosions that rattled the Baltic Sea. The European Union on Wednesday said all available information indicates that they were the result of a \"deliberate act,\" although it did not assign blame.\n\nAs the leaks sparked alarm among the diplomatic community, so too did it prompt concern from environmentalists. Methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas - 30 times stronger than carbon dioxide over 100 years and 80 times stronger over 20 years. Although it stays in the atmosphere for only around a decade compared to carbon dioxide which can stay in the atmosphere for anywhere between 300 and 1,000 years.\n\nHow bad the climate and environmental impact turns out to be depends partly on how much gas is in the pipes and how much is escaping, much of which remains unclear. Neither pipeline was in operation but both contained gas, according to Reuters.\n\nWhat is clear is that any methane leak will have some impact.\n\n\"Methane leaked rather than burnt is around 30 times worse for climate,\" Piers Forster, director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate at the University of Leeds, told the Science Media Centre. \"The leak will have a strong immediate warming effect and cause poor air quality as well.\"\n\nGrant Allen, a professor of atmospheric physics at the University of Manchester, said because the pipelines were not pumping and were just pressurised once the gas had escaped the leak should stop. Some of the methane emitted will be oxidised into carbon dioxide as it rises, he said, but due to the violent rush out of the pipe most of the gas would reach the sea surface as methane.\n\n\"It has been estimated that there may be up to 177 million cubic metres of natural gas still residual in Nordstream 2 alone,\" he said, adding that this was equivalent to the natural gas used by 124,000 UK homes in a year.\n\n\"This is not a small amount of gas, and represents a reckless emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\"\n\nBloomberg reported that Germany had estimated that about 300,000 metric tons of methane had entered the atmosphere due to the leaks. The Independent has not confirmed the report.\n\nGreenpeace put it this way in a Tweet on Wednesday: \"We don't know exactly how much gas was in the pipelines, how much leaked, and how much is absorbed by the water instead of the air. But what's certain is that this is terrible news for the climate, and that Europe's addiction to gas must end.\"\n\nProfessor Forster said compared to the daily leaks in the poorly maintained gas network around the world this leak will be small. Every day, around 10 per cent of our global gas supply is leaked into the atmosphere, he said.\n\n\"This is both wasteful and bad for climate,\" he said. \"Getting on top of leaking gas pipes generally can really reduce warming rates this decade.\"\n\nMany scientists and activists said renewable energy infrastructure was not only cheaper but more secure than fossil fuel infrastructure. Governments should do everything possible to move to renewables and cut energy waste, rather than look for more gas supplies, said Greenpeace.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/09/28/15/newFile-5.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 17, "stanza_neu": 11, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 30, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7207072838", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-29", "time": "21:47:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-29T21:47:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-29T20:19:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "url": "https://roanoke.com/news/science/baltic-sea-pipeline-leak-damages-marine-life-and-climate/article_199671e2-2f39-55ae-a73c-d5fc6a236bf2.html", "title": "Baltic Sea pipeline leak damages marine life and climate", "body": "By CHRISTINA LARSON - AP Science Writer\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Methane escaping from the damaged Nord Stream pipelines that run between Russia and Europe is likely to result in the biggest known gas leak to take place over a short period of time and highlights the problem of large methane escapes elsewhere around the world, scientists say.\n\nThere is still uncertainty in estimating total damage, but researchers say vast plumes of this potent greenhouse gas will have significant detrimental impacts on the climate.\n\nImmediate harm to marine life and fisheries in the Baltic Sea and to human health will also result because benzene and other trace chemicals are typically present in natural gas, researchers say.\n\n\"This will probably be the biggest gas leak ever, in terms of its rate,\" said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson.\n\nPeople are also reading...

If the gas-air mix was within a certain range, an airplane could easily ignite travelling into the plume, for example.\n\nMethane isn't the only risk. \"Natural gas isn't refined to be super clean -- there are trace elements of other compounds, like benzene,\" a carcinogen, said Leifer.\n\n\"The amount of these trace elements cumulatively entering the environment is significant right now -- this will cause issues for fisheries and marine ecosystems and people who potentially eat those fish,\" he said.\n\nDavid Archer, a professor in the geophysical sciences department at University of Chicago who focuses on the global carbon cycle, said that escape of methane in the Baltic Sea is part of the much larger worldwide problem of methane emissions.\n\nThe gas is a major contributor to climate change, responsible for a significant share of the climate disruption people are already experiencing. That is because it is 82.5 times more potent than carbon dioxide at absorbing the sun's heat and warming the Earth, over the short term.\n\nClimate scientist have found that methane emissions from the oil and gas industry are far worse than what companies are reporting, despite claims by major companies that they've reduced their emissions.\n\nScientists measuring methane from satellites in space have found that emissions from oil and gas operations are usually at least twice as high as what the companies reported, said Thomas Lauvaux, climate scientist at University of Reims in France.\n\nMany of those so-called leaks are not accidental. Companies release the gas during routine maintenance. Lauvaux and other scientists observed more than 1,500 major methane leaks globally, and potentially tens of thousands of smaller leaks, using satellites, he said.\n\n--\n\nAP reporters Patrick Whittle contributed from Portland, Maine, Seth Borenstein from Washington, DC., and Cathy Bussewitz from New York.\n\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

OLSEN and PATRICK WHITTLE - Associated Press\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Methane leaking from the damaged Nord Stream pipelines is likely to be the biggest burst of the potent greenhouse gas on record, by far.\n\nThe Nord Stream pipeline leaks that were pumping huge volumes of methane into the Baltic Sea and atmosphere could discharge as much as five times as much of the potent greenhouse as was released by the Aliso Canyon disaster, the largest known terrestrial release of methane in U.S. history. It is also the equivalent of one third of Denmark's total annual greenhouse gas emissions, a Danish official warned Wednesday.\n\n\"Whoever ordered this should be prosecuted for war crimes and go to jail,\" said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist. Two scientists looked at the official worst case scenario estimates provided by the Danish government -- 778 million cubic meters of gas -- for the Associated Press. They calculated that would be an equivalent of roughly half a million metric tons of methane. The Aliso Canyon disaster released 90-100,000 metric tons.\n\nAndrew Baxter, a chemical engineer who formerly worked in the offshore oil and gas industry, and is now at the environmental group EDF thought the Danish estimate was likely too high. He had a more conservative estimate. But it was still more than double the Aliso Canyon disaster.\n\n\"That's one thing that is consistent with these estimates,\" he said, \"It's catastrophic for the climate.\"\n\nKristoffer B\u00f6ttzauw, head of the Danish Energy Agency, said emissions from the three leaks on the underwater Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines correspond to approximately 32% of annual Danish carbon dioxide emissions. Danish emissions in 2020 were approximately 45 million tonnes of CO2.\n\nSabotage was suspected to have caused the leaks, and seismologists said Tuesday that explosions rattled the Baltic Sea before they were discovered. Some European officials and energy experts have said Russia is likely to blame since it directly benefits from higher energy prices and economic anxiety across Europe. But others cautioned against pointing fingers until investigators are able to determine what happened.\n\nMethane seen bubbling at the ocean surface was an indication of \"a strong upward flow,\" according to Paul Balcombe, a member of the engineering faculty at the department of chemical engineering at Imperial College London.\n\nThe loss of pressure in the pipe likely meant a large amount of gas was already lost, he said. The impacts of the gas leak are still coming into focus, Balcombe said, but are likely to be significant.\n\n\"It would have a very large environmental and climate impact indeed, even if it released a fraction of this,\" he said.\n\nMethane is a major contributor to climate change, responsible for a significant share of the climate disruption people are already experiencing. That is because it is 82.5 times more potent than carbon dioxide at absorbing the sun's heat and warming the Earth.\n\nB\u00f6ttzauw, told a press conference that the agency expects the gas to be out of the pipes, that run from Russia to Germany, by Sunday.\n\n\"We believe that half the gas is out by now of one of the two pipes,\" B\u00f6ttzauw said. \"We are talking about a huge spill of several million cubic meters of gas.\"\n\nThe Danish agency statement added that its calculation was based on information from operators Nord Stream AG and Nord Stream 2 AG about the content of natural gas in the three pipelines that are leaking.\n\nThe incidents come as the EU struggles to keep a lid on soaring gas and electricity prices.\n\n\"As long as there is gas, it dangerous to be there,\" B\u00f6ttzauw said, declining to say when experts would be able to go down and see the pipes, which he said was made of 12-centimeter (5-inch) thick steel coated with concrete. They lie on the seabed between 70 and 90 meters (230 feet and 295 feet) deep.\n\nThe leaks all were in international waters. Two were within the Danish exclusive economic zone while the third is in the Swedish equivalent.\n\nWhittle reported from Portland, Maine.

If the gas-air mix was within a certain range, an airplane could easily ignite travelling into the plume, for example.\n\nMethane isn't the only risk. \"Natural gas isn't refined to be super clean -- there are trace elements of other compounds, like benzene,\" a carcinogen, said Leifer.\n\n\"The amount of these trace elements cumulatively entering the environment is significant right now -- this will cause issues for fisheries and marine ecosystems and people who potentially eat those fish,\" he said.\n\nDavid Archer, a professor in the geophysical sciences department at University of Chicago who focuses on the global carbon cycle, said that escape of methane in the Baltic Sea is part of the much larger worldwide problem of methane emissions.\n\nThe gas is a major contributor to climate change, responsible for a significant share of the climate disruption people are already experiencing. That is because it is 82.5 times more potent than carbon dioxide at absorbing the sun's heat and warming the Earth, over the short term.\n\nClimate scientist have found that methane emissions from the oil and gas industry are far worse than what companies are reporting, despite claims by major companies that they've reduced their emissions.\n\nScientists measuring methane from satellites in space have found that emissions from oil and gas operations are usually at least twice as high as what the companies reported, said Thomas Lauvaux, climate scientist at University of Reims in France.\n\nMany of those so-called leaks are not accidental. Companies release the gas during routine maintenance. Lauvaux and other scientists observed more than 1,500 major methane leaks globally, and potentially tens of thousands of smaller leaks, using satellites, he said.\n\n--\n\nAP reporters Patrick Whittle contributed from Portland, Maine, Seth Borenstein from Washington, DC., and Cathy Bussewitz from New York.\n\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

These are not accidents,\" said Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister. The leaks were detected in Danish and Swedish waters.\n\nBoth pipelines still contain gas under pressure, but are not delivering the fuel to Europe. Nord Stream 1 was taken offline by Vladmir Putin at the start of September, while Nord Stream 2 had not entered operation before the EU cancelled it because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe methane that is being released has a terrible impact on the climate: methane is a greenhouse gas 86 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.

In Alaska, the permafrost also contains massive wedges of ice locked within the ground. When the ice melts, the ground surface collapses and forms a sinkhole that is filled with water, creating a thermokarst lake.\n\nKatey Walter Anthony is a researcher collaborating with NASA's Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) which is a large-scale study of environmental change and its implications for social-ecological systems. She has been studying the formation of thermokarst lakes and how the process influences Earth's climate change.\n\n\"Lakes like Big Trail are new, they're young, and they are important because these lakes are what's going to happen in the future,\" she explained.\n\nAlso Read | Shifting monsoon patterns\n\nThe methane bubbles emerging from these newly formed lakes are caused by microbial activity. The microbes digest the dead plants and organic matter in the previously frozen ground, which produces carbon dioxide and methane. Permafrost thaw can also form under-lake chimneys that allow gases like methane to escape from where they were trapped underground.\n\n\"At Big Trail Lake, it's like opening your freezer door for the first time and giving all the food in your freezer to microbes to decompose. As they decompose it, they are belching out methane gas,\" says Walter Anthony.\n\nAn easy way to test if the lake is emitting old methane is to light a match near the collected gas sample from the lake. As a flammable gas, it will catch fire easily until the supply is maintained. Scientists use field measurements, collected samples and airborne radar data to estimate how much methane these lakes are releasing across a large area.\n\nMethane is the primary contributor to the formation of ground-level ozone, a hazardous air pollutant. A powerful greenhouse gas, it is 80 times more potent at warming than carbon dioxide over a period of 20 years, as per aUNEPreport. Though it has a much shorter atmospheric lifetime than carbon dioxide, methane is responsible for 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the industrial revolution.

Scientists say sharp cuts in methane emissions over the next few years will be a vital lever in curbing climate change.\n\nHARD TO QUANTIFY\n\nJasmin Cooper, a research associate at Imperial College London's Sustainable Gas Institute, said it would be difficult to quantify exactly how much gas was reaching the atmosphere - especially given scarce existing data on leaks from subsea pipelines.\n\n\"Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) will probably have an estimate based on gas throughputs, but in terms of how much gas/methane is emitted into the atmosphere ... they need to send out a team now to measure and monitor,\" she said, referring to the state-owned Russian gas firm.\n\nA \"conservative estimate\" based on available data suggests the leaks together were releasing more than 500 metric tons of methane per hour when first breached, with the pressure and flow rate decreasing over time, said Jean-Francois Gauthier, vice president of measurements at the commercial methane-measuring satellite firm GHGSat.\n\nBy comparison, the huge Aliso Canyon gas leak in the United States in 2016 spewed around 50 tons of methane per hour at its peak. \"So this would be an order of magnitude more,\" Gauthier said.\n\nA spokesman for Nord Stream 2 - one of the leaking pipelines, which never started operating and was shelved by Germany just before Russia invaded Ukraine - said this week the system held 300 million cubic metres of gas.\n\nReleasing that amount in entirety to the atmosphere would result in around 200,000 tonnes of methane emissions, said chemical engineer Paul Balcombe at London's Queen Mary University.\n\nGerman non-profit Deutsche Umwelthilfe gave a similar estimate of the pipeline's potential emissions.\n\nThat amount of methane would have about the same global warming potential over a 100-year timeframe as about 6 million tons of carbon dioxide, according to Reuters calculations based on IPCC conversion factors. That's roughly on par with the amount of CO2 emitted in an entire year by mid-sized cities such as Havana, or Helsinki or Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThe amount of gas leaking from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline system is less clear, with a pipeline spokesman declining to say how much was left in the system when it was taken offline for maintenance a few weeks ago.\n\nStefano Grassi, head of the European Union energy commissioner's cabinet, said Tuesday that the leaks risked becoming \"a climate and ecological disaster\".\n\n\"We are in contact with [EU member states] to look into what happened and find the fastest way to stop leaks and avoid worse damage,\" Grassi said in a tweet.\n\nEU countries were among more than 100 countries, including the United States, Brazil, Pakistan and Mexico that pledged last year to slash their combined methane emissions by 30% by 2030, in a bid to help stave off disastrous levels of climate change.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL RISK\n\nWhile oil spills can immediately affect and ultimately kill wildlife, authorities say the gas pipeline gas leaks pose a limited threat to the surrounding plant and animal life.\n\nThe German environment ministry said the leaks would not pose a significant threat to marine life, but Greenpeace raised concerns on Tuesday that fish may get caught in plumes of gas, which could interfere with their breathing.\n\nDenmark's Energy Agency told Reuters said it was too early to say who would investigate the Nord Stream 2 leak and no-one has been to look at the pipeline yet.\n\nIt added the leaks will likely continue for several days and perhaps even a week.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXMPEI8Q118_M.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 19, "stanza_neu": 8, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 27, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7206838835", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-29", "time": "17:19:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-29T17:19:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-29T17:19:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5803921818733215, "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/nato-warns-nordstream-pipeline-sabotage-climate-baltics-experts-decry-rcna49930", "title": "NATO issues 'sabotage' warning after gas pipeline explosions", "body": "LONDON -- NATO on Thursday left the door open to possible military action in response to what it said was deliberate sabotage after explosions on underwater natural gas pipelines between Russia and Europe.\n\n\"All currently available information indicates that this is the result of deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,\" it said in a statement.\n\nWestern governments have pointed the finger of blame for the leaks at Russia, which has flatly denied any suggestion it was responsible for explosions that caused them.\n\nThe statement from NATO, a military alliance established in part to counter the then-Soviet Union's expansionism, added:\n\n\"We, as allies, have committed to prepare for, deter and defend against the coercive use of energy and other hybrid tactics by state and non-state actors. Any deliberate attack against allies' critical infrastructure would be met with a united and determined response.\"\n\nLeaks from the two underwater natural gas pipelines, Nord Stream 1 and 2, have caused the release of millions of tons of methane since they were first reported earlier this week. While neither pipeline is currently transporting gas, they contained huge amounts.\n\nMethane is the second-biggest contributor to global warming after carbon emissions and is far more effective in absorbing the sun's heat.\n\nThe Danish government estimates that in a worst-case scenario, a combined 778 million cubic meters (27 billion square feet) would flow into the sea from the two damaged pipes.\n\nOn Wednesday, Denmark's energy agency said that more than half the gas in the pipes had already leaked into the sea and the rest would be gone by Sunday.

Peter Meijer (R-Mich.) and Sean Casten (D-Ill.) seeks to tackle the problem. The Methane Emissions Mitigation Research and Development Act \"focuses our best and brightest at the Department of Energy on methane emissions, one of the most potent greenhouse gasses,\" Meijer said in a statement.\n\n\"It also provides our local governments and private industries with the necessary tools to mitigate methane emissions and leaks,\" he added.\n\nAmong these tools are the suite of leak detection and repair (LDAR) technologies, which include the satellite tools that the Science team used to quantify the imperfect nature of venting and flaring, common features of natural gas drilling.\n\nAt times or in areas where there isn't sufficient pipeline or storage for the quantities of natural gas being produced -- sometimes as a byproduct of more lucrative oil -- drilling operators \"flare,\" or burn off, the methane.\n\nIt had long been believed that flaring converts all the methane into water vapor and relatively inert carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that, while it still heats the climate, is far less potent.\n\nBut this is an \"overly optimistic view\" of flaring, which leaves far more methane behind than had been believed, according to a companion essay in Science.\n\nIn fact, studies of three major natural gas basins -- the Eagle Ford and Permian in Texas, and the Bakken of North Dakota -- found that only 91 percent of the methane is consumed. That's in part because flares are often malfunctioning or simply unlit -- allowing raw methane to vent into the atmosphere.\n\nIf these flares operated properly at even 98 percent efficiency, they would cut emissions enough to be the equivalent of removing nearly 3 million cars from the road, the Science team found.\n\nEnough gas was flared in 2021 to make up about two-thirds of current EU demand -- but most oil and gas producers don't directly check or report how efficiently that gas was burned off.\n\nComplete combustion of natural gas at flare sites would also spare nearby communities from potentially toxic impacts. About half a million people live within three miles of flare sites in these three basins -- which puts them at direct risk from the potentially toxic organic compounds released if those flares malfunction.\n\nSuch failures to properly combust waste gas could \"expose front-line communities to a cocktail of co-pollutants that present risks of acute and/or chronic health impacts,\" the team wrote in a statement.\n\nThese leaks are a major problem for both U.S. emission goals and for the attempt of gas producers to brand themselves as a low-carbon bridge fuel -- or a feedstock for new-model fuels like blue hydrogen, a still largely frontier product fabricated from gas from which the carbon has been captured and stored.\n\nThe Science study builds on a 2021 paper in Environmental Research Letters that found that about 60 percent of total methane emissions from the Permian Basin -- a region that produces about 18 percent of U.S. natural gas -- came from 1,000 \"super emitter\" wells.\n\nAnd the International Energy Agency in 2020 estimated global flaring efficiency at about 92 percent -- approximately what the Science team just confirmed for the United States.\n\nThe solution, according to the Science team, is similar to the one Casten and Meijer are asking for: better technology. \"Together, satellites, surface sensors, and models can provide more-accurate assessments of the role that improved flaring efficiency plays in overall O&G emissions and future mitigation efforts,\" the researchers wrote in the companion essay.\n\nBut they cautioned that fixing the problem would require more than simply new technology, but would also require \"further improvements in monitoring, regulations, and industry practices.\"\n\nThe time for taking action on this is now, Casten wrote in a statement.\n\n\"2021 saw the highest annual growth rate for methane emissions to date,\" he said. \"This problem is not slowing down and will only increase without action.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/methaneemissions_istock.jpg?w=1280", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 12, "stanza_neu": 10, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 25, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7205474561", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-28", "time": "17:40:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-28T17:40:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-28T17:22:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5137255191802979, "url": "https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/Official-Gas-leaks-around-1-3-of-Denmark-s-CO2-17472808.php", "title": "Official: Gas leaks around 1/3 of Denmark's CO2 emissions", "body": "Kristoffer B\u00f6ttzauw, head of the Danish Energy Agency, said emissions from the three leaks on the underwater Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines correspond to approximately 32% of annual Danish carbon dioxide emissions.

But if we fix flaring issues, the payoff is huge: the equivalent of removing 3 million cars from the roads.\n\nIndustry and regulators operate under the assumption flares are constantly lit and that they burn off 98% of methane when in operation. Data taken via aerial surveys in the three U.S. geographical basins, which are home to more than 80% of U.S. flaring operations, shows both assumptions are incorrect. Flares were found to be unlit approximately 3%-5% of the time and, even when lit, they were found operating at low efficiency. Combined, those factors lead to an average effective flaring efficiency rate of only 91%.\n\n\"There is a lot more methane being added to the atmosphere than currently accounted for in any inventories or estimates,\" said Eric Kort, U-M associate professor of climate and space sciences and engineering, principal investigator of the F3UEL project and senior scientist on the new research.\n\nOil production can come with methane as a byproduct, and when it's not cost-effective to capture it, the gas must be safely disposed of. Burning methane by flaring as it is released converts it to carbon dioxide, another greenhouse gas but one that is less harmful on a pound-by-pound basis.\n\nOver the course of three years, researchers made 13 flights in planes equipped with air monitoring equipment to assess how much methane is released from flares across oil and gas production basins. Flights were conducted in the Permian and Eagle Ford oil and gas fields in Texas, as well as the Bakken oil and gas field in North Dakota.\n\nPlanes flew downwind of flaring sites -- crisscrossing the direct pathways of the air plumes released by flaring. Tubes and pumps drew air into the onboard instrumentation, where laser scanning at a specific frequency measures the amount of carbon dioxide and methane it carries.\n\nMeasuring both gasses simultaneously allowed researchers to estimate the destruction removal efficiency of flaring at an individual site.\n\n\"If the flare is operating as it should be, there should be a large carbon dioxide spike and a relatively small methane spike. And depending on the relative enhancement of those two gasses, we can tell how well the flares are performing,\" said Genevieve Plant, lead author on the study and an assistant research scientist in climate and space sciences and engineering.\n\nIn November, the U.S., European Union and additional partners -- 103 countries in all -- launched the Global Methane Pledge to restrict methane emissions. That commitment focused on keeping global temperatures within the 1.5 degree increase limit set by the scientific community to offset the worst impacts of climate change.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe oil industry practice of burning unwanted methane is less effective than previously assumed, scientists said Thursday, resulting in new estimates for releases of the greenhouse gas in the United States that are about five times as high than earlier ones.\n\nIn a study of the three largest oil and gas basins in the United States, the researchers found that the practice, known as flaring, often doesn't completely burn the methane, a potent heat-trapping gas that is often a byproduct of oil production. And in many cases, they discovered, flares are extinguished and not reignited, so all the methane escapes into the atmosphere.\n\nImproving efficiency and ensuring that all flares remain lit would result in annual emissions reductions in the United States equal to taking nearly 3 million cars off the road each year, the scientists said.\n\n\"Flares have been kind of 'out of sight, out of mind,'\" said one of the researchers, Eric A. Kort, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Michigan. \"But they actually matter more for climate than we realized.\"\n\n\"So if we clean up our act with these flares, we actually would have a much more positive climate impact than we would have realized initially,\" Dr. Kort said.\n\nUnderstand the Latest News on Climate ChangeCard 1 of 4\n\nWildfire smoke pollution. Smoke from wildfires has worsened over the past decade, potentially reversing decades of improvements in Western air quality made under the Clean Air Act, according to new research from Stanford University. Some areas in the Western United States had increases in particulate pollution from smoke that were about the same amount as the improvements in air quality from regulating factories and other sources of pollution.\n\nRelinquishing a fortune. Yvon Chouinard, the founder of the outdoor apparel maker Patagonia, transferred ownership of his company to a trust and an organization devoted to fighting climate change. The move comes at a moment of growing scrutiny for billionaires whose rhetoric about making the world a better place often don't match reality.\n\nHigh stakes. A new scientific assessment suggests that failure to limit global warming to the targets set by international accords will most likely set off several climate \"tipping points,\" thresholds passed which effects of climate change, from the thawing of Arctic permafrost to the loss of coral reefs, would probably become irreversible.\n\nMelting ice. In a more drastic forecast than earlier assessments, a new study found that the melting of the Greenland ice sheet could eventually raise global sea levels by at least 10 inches. The study reached the conclusion in part because it used a different measure to gauge ice loss that takes into account the warming that has already occurred.\n\nBecause methane is a stronger, though shorter-lived, greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, efforts to identify and reduce methane emissions have intensified in recent years.\n\nMethane is the primary component of natural gas, also known as fossil gas, which can leak into the atmosphere from wells, pipelines and other infrastructure, and is also deliberately released for maintenance or other reasons.\n\nBut vast amounts are flared.\n\nGas that is flared is often produced with oil at wells around the world, or at other industry facilities. There may not be a pipeline or other means to market it economically, and because it is flammable, it poses safety issues. In such cases, the gas is sent through a vertical pipe with an igniter at the top, and burned.\n\nThe International Energy Agency estimated that worldwide in 2021, more than 140 million cubic meters of methane was burned in this way, equal to the amount imported that year by Germany, France and the Netherlands.\n\nIf the combustion is efficient, almost all of the methane is destroyed, converted into carbon dioxide, which has less of an immediate climate impact. The Environmental Protection Agency, in studies conducted in the 1980s, calculated that flares destroyed 98 percent of the methane sent through them.\n\nBut the new research found that flaring was actually far less effective, especially when unlit flares were taken into account. Emissions from improper flaring accounted for as much as 10 percent of all methane emissions in the oil and gas industry, the scientists said. The findings were published in the journal Science.\n\nThe researchers looked at operations in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins in Texas and the Bakken in North Dakota, which together account for about 80 percent of the flaring in the United States. \"The idea was if we can go do a nice representative sample in those domains, we'd get a good picture of what it looks like looks like across the U.S.,\" Dr. Kort said. They sampled gas plumes from the flares by flying through them in a small plane.\n\nThey found that flares that were burning destroyed only about 95 percent of methane, not 98 percent. And they found that in some basins as much as 5 percent of flares were unlit. That brought the overall efficiency down to about 91 percent.\n\nFlares can be affected by wind, which can allow some unburned methane to escape, or by the presence of other gases. Wind, changes in gas pressure or problems with the igniter can cause the flame to be extinguished, and if there is not routine monitoring, flares can remain unlit for a long time.\n\nRiley Duren, chief executive of Carbon Mapper, a nonprofit group that is launching satellites next year that will detect and monitor sources of greenhouse gas emissions, said the findings were not surprising to those who have studied emissions from these oil and gas basins and know the amount of flaring that is done.\n\nBut the researchers' comprehensive survey shows that inefficient flaring \"is a more systematic issue,\" said Dr. Duren, who was not involved in the study.\n\nElsewhere in the world, there is little direct observational evidence of flaring efficiency, Dr. Duren said. But globally, he said, \"it's likely the case that combustion and flaring is less efficient than assumed.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/29/climate/29cli-methane/29cli-methane-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-8052865", "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 21, "stanza_neu": 21, "stanza_pos": 3, "swn_neg": 45, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7207175507", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-30", "time": "00:27:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-30T00:27:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-30T00:26:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4470588266849518, "url": "https://sputniknews.com/20220930/nord-stream-to-dump-unprecedented-methane-gas-levels-but-may-not-have-major-effect-experts-claim-1101359173.html", "title": "Nord Stream to Dump Unprecedented Methane Gas Levels But May Not Have 'Major' Effect, Experts Claim", "body": "Though methane leaking from the yet unexplained damage to the Nord Stream pipelines is likely to dump an unprecedented amount of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, some experts see it as a drop in the bucket after reviewing data released by the Danish Energy Agency, which allowed experts to produce preliminary estimates of methane leakage.The leak isn't likely to affect marine life in the way an oil leak might, despite its size, according to Jasmin Cooper, a research associate at the Sustainable Gas Institute. \"The environmental impact will be toward global warming.\"The environmental group EDP's calculation doubles that of the Aliso Canyon Disaster, with chemical engineer Andrew Baxter saying \"just one of the pipelines could release emissions equalling the annual emissions of two million cars.\"A researcher with the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences in France preferred a wider perspective, comparing the projected emissions to the 250 million cars operating in the European Union alone.However, some scientists caution against underestimating the potential impacts of the leak, which echoes the worst-case scenario projections compiled by the Danish government -778 million cubic liters, veering from more conservative estimates.Paul Balcombe, a faculty member in the chemical engineering department at Imperial College London, warns that \"the effects of the leak are still coming into focus,\" and that \"[the leak] would have a very large environmental and climate impact indeed - even if it released a fraction of this.\"Due to safety concerns, access to the site is limited.
