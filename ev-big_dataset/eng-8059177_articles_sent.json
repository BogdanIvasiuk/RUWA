Russian Officials Respond", "body": "\"Thank you, USA\" - Mr. Sikorski, Poland's former Minister of Defense, wrote on Twitter. It was a comment on the mysterious leaks in the Russian-owned Nord Stream gas pipelines discovered on Tuesday, September 27.\n\nFirst Deputy Permanent Representative of Russia to the UN Dmitry Polyanskiy joined the fiery exchange between Sikorski and Zakharova, ironically thanking Mr. Sikorski for revealing who was behind the \"terrorist-style targeting of civilian infrastructure\".\n\nSikorski himself quoted US President Joe Biden, who said at a press conference in February 2022 that if Russia attacks [Ukraine], \"there will be no longer a Nord Stream II\". When asked by reporters how the US intends to do it, he assured them that it \"will be able to do that\".\n\nSikorski, who also served as the head of Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recalled that Ukraine and all the Baltic States have opposed the construction of Nord Stream II for 20 years, and now \"$20 billion of scrap metal lies at the bottom of the [Baltic] sea - another cost to Russia after its criminal decision to invade Ukraine\". In another post, Mr. Sikorski stated that such a situation strengthens the position of Poland, Ukraine, as well as Turkey. He also pointed out that the pipeline was a tool for Putin to \"blackmail or wage war on Eastern Europe with impunity\", and that the damage to Nord Stream narrows Putin's room for maneuver- \"if he wants to resume gas supplies to Europe, he will have to talk to the countries controlling the Brotherhood and Yamal pipelines\".\n\nFor his statement, the MEP was also attacked by representatives of Poland's ruling Law and Justice party. The spokesman for Polish intelligence services Stanis\u0142aw \u017baryn called Sikorski's Tweet \"irresponsible\", while Deputy Minister for the Interior Maciej W\u0105sik said that the statement will surely be used by Russian propaganda.\n\n\"Let's remember that Putin doesn't need his agents and useful idiots to love Russia. It's enough for them to be anti-Western\" - Sikorski responded to his critics.\n\nIt is not the first time that the former Minister of Foreign Affairs Rados\u0142aw Sikorski and Russia's MFA spokeswoman Maria Zakharova exchanged such harsh words. Another spat took place when Sikorski recalled that Russia violated the Budapest Memorandum guaranteeing Ukraine's security in exchange for the transfer of nuclear weapons to Russia. Yet another one, when Russians insulted his wife, the Atlantic columnist and writer Anne Applebaum.\n\nAt the time, Sikorski said that it was a good thing that the Russians had read her books \"Gulag\" and \"Red Famine\", and - referring to Zakharova's problems with alcohol - wrote that it was \"good that she got sober\". In the past, Sikorski has compared the Nord Stream II gas pipeline deal to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.\n\n***\n\nEvery day, 400 journalists at Gazeta Wyborcza write verified, fact-checked stories about Polish politics and society, keeping a critical eye on the ruling camp's persistent assault on democratic values and the rule of law; the growing cultural tension between religious fundamentalism and human rights; and the ongoing Russian invasion in Ukraine.

Poland's former foreign minister (2007-2014), European parliament member Radoslaw Sikorski, on Thursday removed from Twitter his thanks to the United States for damaging the Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sikorsky thanked the US for the damage to the Nord Stream gas pipeline on his Twitter page. He illustrated the post with a photo from the site of the emergency and supplied it with a hashtag #Nordstream. In support of his conclusion Washington was behind the incident Sikorski cited US President Joe Biden's remark dropped on February 7 to the effect that the United States would put an end to Nord Stream 2, if Russian troops crossed the Ukrainian border.\n\nSikorski's statement triggered a wave of sharp criticism in Poland. It was called extremely irresponsible. Also, many in Warsaw demanded a probe into Sikorski's sources of funding in addition to his earnings as a member of the European Parliament.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sikorski tried to present an excuse, saying his speculations about the US involvement in damaging the gas pipelines were his personal working suspicion. He said he was glad that the pipeline, which the Polish governments had been fighting against 20 years, was three-quarters paralyzed. He said that was good for Poland and expressed the hope that the Danish investigation would expose those responsible.\n\nOn September 27, Nord Stream AG reported \"unprecedented damage\" on three strings of the offshore gas pipelines of the Nord Stream system. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow was \"extremely concerned about this news.\" He did not rule out that the disruption of the pipelines' operation might have been a result of sabotage.\n\nLater, Swedish seismologists said they had identified two explosions on the routes the Nord Stream pipelines on Monday. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, classified these incidents as sabotage.\n\n\"Any deliberate disruption of European energy infrastructure is utterly unacceptable and will be met with a robust and united response,\" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell underlined in a statement.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that in any case Washington would have to explain gas leaks incidents on pipelines and make a confession. Zakharova also said that the US president was obliged to answer the question whether Washington had acted on its February 7 threat against Nord Stream 2. The US administration has denied that Biden actually threatened to destroy the Nord Stream pipelines. White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said that Biden had in mind joint efforts with Germany to freeze the implementation of the Nord Stream 2 project.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TASS"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png", "eventUri": "eng-8059177", "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 8, "stanza_neu": 13, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 23, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 2, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7205631499", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-28", "time": "20:28:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-28T20:28:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-28T20:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7098039388656616, "url": "https://www.sgtreport.com/2022/09/thank-you-usa-polish-mep-praises-u-s-for-destroyed-nord-stream-pipelines/", "title": "\"Thank You, USA\": Polish MEP Praises U.S. For Destroyed Nord Stream Pipelines", "body": "Polish MEP Radoslaw Sikorski, who attended the Bilderberg meeting in DC earlier this year together with his arch-neocon wife Anne Applebaum, openly \"thanked\" the US for the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines in a post Tuesday on Twitter.\n\n\"Thank you, USA,\" Sikorski said on Twitter, sharing a photograph of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline leaking massive amounts of gas into the ocean off the coast of Denmark's Bornholm island.\n\nRight before making the comment, Sikorski retweeted Biden's \"promise\" from back in February where he said there \"will be no longer a Nord Stream 2\" if Russia invades Ukraine.\n\nRight before making the comment, Sikorski retweeted Biden's \"promise\" from back in February where he said there \"will be no longer a Nord Stream 2\" if Russia invades Ukraine.\n\nThe implication is clearly that the Biden regime bombed the pipelines.\n\nSikorski's wife, Anne Applebaum, has been intimately involved in fomenting the Ukraine war effort and was even given an award by Volodymyr Zelensky himself earlier this month for being a \"journalist\" who is helping \"fight for Ukraine on the military and information fronts.\"\n\nIf the CIA bombed these civilian pipelines that's an insane act of war that will further devastate Europe's economy and risk a full-blown war with Russia.", "source": {"uri": "sgtreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SGT Report"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-8059177", "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 0, "stanza_neu": 6, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 7, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7205173810", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-09-28", "time": "13:31:00", "dateTime": "2022-09-28T13:31:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-09-28T13:02:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "url": "http://conservativeangle.com/poland-slams-politician-who-suggested-u-s-blew-up-pipelines-what-an-act-of-gross-irresponsibility/", "title": "Poland Slams Politician Who Suggested U.S. Blew Up Pipelines: 'What An Act Of Gross Irresponsibility!' - Conservative Angle", "body": "A top Polish official slammed a Polish member of European Parliament on Tuesday for suggesting the United States was behind damage to two Russian gas pipelines to Germany this week.\n\nRadoslaw Sikorski, a member of European Parliament and chairman of the Delegation for relations with the United States, wrote on Twitter, \"Thank you, USA,\" along with a picture that showed methane coming to the surface from one of the spots where the pipeline ruptured.\n\n\"By the way, there's no shortage of pipeline capacity for taking gas from Russia to Western Europe, including Germany,\" Sikorski claimed on Twitter. \"Nordstream's only logic was for Putin to be able to blackmail or wage war on Eastern Europe with impunity.\"\n\n\"All Ukrainian and Baltic sea states have opposed Nordstream's construction for 20 years,\" he continued. \"Now $20 billion of scrap metal lies at the bottom of the sea, another cost to Russia of its criminal decision to invade Ukraine.

In support and justification, his old friend and PO ministerial colleague, Roman Giertych, warned Sikorski's critics: \"Would you nutters prefer that the Russians find us guilty?\"\n\nIn Washington this week to ask for more military and financial assistance, Zbigniew Rau, the PiS foreign minister, said: \"Rados\u0142aw Sikorski in this hybrid war between Russia and NATO countries has taken the wrong side.\"\n\nSignalling the domestic impact of the Nord Stream operation, TVP Info, controlled by the government's broadcast agency Telewizja Polska, headlined Rau as attacking Sikorski, not the Russians for the alleged seabed attack. \"The hypothesis that Russian services are behind it is becoming more and more credible,\" Rau reportedly added.\n\nMaciej W\u0105sik, the PiS official in charge of the Polish security services at the Interior Ministry, was more explicit. He tweeted:\n\nState Department officials were telling the truth, Wasik said - Sikorski was lying. The tweet reads: \"US State Department spokesman on Sikorski's statements: 'The idea that the US was behind the Nord Stream explosions is ridiculous and is nothing more than a function of Russian disinformation.' Sikorski. Civil Platform. Russian disinformation.\"\n\n\"I don't know if the U.S. is behind the explosion of gas pipelines in the Baltic,\" commented Roman Giertych (right); he was a deputy prime\n\nminister in the PiS government of 2007-2007, when Sikorski was defence minister, then foreign minister; they are reported to be friends.\n\nGiertych tweeted: \"I don't know if the U.S. is behind the explosion of gas pipelines in the Baltic. But I do know that I'd rather the Russians think they were behind it than us. And I am very concerned that there is some rage within the Law and Justice Party against Sikorski for his tweet. Would you nutters prefer that the Russians find us guilty?\"\n\nThis support failed to relieve Sikorski; he has erased his tweet in support of the operation. But Giertych has continued to defend Sikorski by showing Sikorski's wife, Anne Applebaum, receiving an award from the Ukrainian president in Kiev:\n\nFor the time being, the official Russian counter-attack has focused on the US role in the operation, keeping silent on the Polish one. This may change as the promised Russian government investigation decides to publish parts of the Russian intelligence records. \"I hope, \" Maria Zakharova, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in the most detailed statement to date from Moscow on Thursday afternoon, \"that someone in the United States, or maybe someone in Europe -- although, unfortunately, Europe in this case can no longer be counted on -- someone from among independent investigators will have a desire to clarify the involvement of the United States, its special services and all other bodies in what happened on 25-27 September of this year in the Baltic Sea.\"\n\nZakharova is making a Russian pitch at the public opinion of the Germans - possibly the last one - but no longer the Poles. \"There is a feeling that for Europe, at an existential level, the very idea that those whom they call 'allies' may be behind this incident, [and that their] provocation, sabotage is unacceptable. This idea is so monstrous for them and marks the point of no return that they cannot afford other arguments than the hackneyed Russian 'factor'. They are afraid to break away from the 'written', because then the whole ideology will collapse at an instant, and the terrible truth will be exposed.\"\n\n\"But we have to start somewhere. Brussels will still have to explain to its citizens what they have done to their continent. With ours. This is our continent, too.\"\n\nby Editor - Friday, September 30th, 2022\n\nFrom http://johnhelmer.net/aftershock-of-nord-stream-explosions-rumbles-warsaw-polish-politicians-go-nutters/", "source": {"uri": "therussophile.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheRussophiles"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/therussophile.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2737AFTERSHOCK-OF-NORD-STREAM-1.jpg?fit=514%2C347&ssl=1", "eventUri": "eng-8059177", "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 13, "stanza_neu": 24, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 38, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7208761037", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-10-01", "time": "16:22:00", "dateTime": "2022-10-01T16:22:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-10-01T15:59:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6039215922355652, "url": "https://www.sgtreport.com/2022/10/should-europeans-thank-the-americans-for-destroying-nord-stream/", "title": "Should Europeans 'Thank' the Americans for Destroying Nord Stream?", "body": "Europe should have heeded the advice of Henry Kissinger: \"To be an enemy of the U.S. is dangerous, but to be a friend is fatal.\"\n\nWith an investigation continuing into the destruction of the Nord Stream gas pipeline that provided energy supplies to Europe from Russia, there appears to be just one prime suspect, and that should surprise nobody.\n\nFollowing the sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines, former Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski already seemed to know the identity of the perpetrator when he tweeted out: \"Thank you, USA.\"\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nAt first glance, it seemed that Sikorski was speaking sarcastically, berating Washington for carrying out an attack that will have severe repercussions for the people of Europe. After all, how could anyone see any good coming from the termination of Europe's primary source of gas reserves with winter just around the corner? It was Sikorski's homeland of Poland, after all, that urged its citizens to collect firewood in the face of dwindling gas reserves.\n\nIn fact, the Polish diplomat was speaking one-hundred percent literally, thanking the United States for plunging the continent deeper into the abyss. This has been the attitude of European leaders from the start of Russia's special military operation in Ukraine: 'we will accept our self-destruction as scripted by Washington policymakers so long as the baddies in Moscow hears our virtue-signaling whimpers and screams.' European capitals are about to learn the hard way that virtue signaling does not put food on the table or heat homes.\n\nJudging by the rising temperature in Europe, however, last seen in Italy where a far-right leader has come to power on the wave of voters fed up with high electricity bills and loose immigration, the phrase 'Thank you, USA' may eventually be chiseled into Europe's tombstone.\n\nBut first, the big question: was the United States really responsible for the destruction of Nord Stream, as Sikorski seems to believe? Well, if we were are to take bumbling Joe Biden at his word, then the answer would seem to be yes.\n\n\"If Russia invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine, again, then there will be -- there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2,\" the U.S. leader told reporters two weeks before Russia began its Ukrainian mission. \"We will bring an end to it.\"\n\nWhen asked to specify, Biden responded, \"I promise you, we'll be able to do it.\"\n\nThere are other clues that point to American complicity.\n\nOn September 2, an American helicopter with the call sign FFAB123 was observed maneuvering in the area of the Nord Stream pipelines. According to the site ads-b.nl, six aircraft used this call sign that day, of which the tail numbers of three were established. All of them were Sikorsky MH-60S. By overlaying the FFAB123 route on the scheme marking the areas of the explosions, it is observable that the helicopter either flew along the Nord Stream-2 route, or exactly between the points where the 'accident' occurred.\n\nMeanwhile, on Twitter, there are screenshots of other American aircraft flights as of September 13th in exactly the same area. In June there was an article in Sea Power magazine where the Americans boast of experiments in the field of underwater drones that they set up at the BALTOPS 22 exercises - in the area of Bornholm Island, the Danish island where the explosions were reported to have occurred.\n\n\"Experimentation was conducted off the coast of Bornholm, Denmark, with participants from Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific, Naval Undersea Warfare Center Newport, and Mine Warfare Readiness and Effectiveness Measuring all under the direction of U.S. 6th Fleet Task Force 68,\" Sea Power reports.\n\nSuch an \"experiment\" would have required the deep-sea equipment needed for reaching the depths where the Nord Stream pipelines are located.\n\nFinally, here's one last tantalizing piece of information for all of the 'coincidence theorists' out there. On the day after Nord Stream 1 and 2 went offline, Poland, Norway and Denmark's leaders attended the opening ceremony of the new Baltic Pipe, which will transport natural gas from Norway via Denmark and through the Baltic Sea to, yes, Sikorski's ferociously Russophobic homeland of Poland. Yes, just a coincidence.\n\nHowever, the main motivating factor for Washington having a hand in destroying Nord Stream is the awesome powers - both financial and political - that it will reap. The economic crisis in Europe is already forcing companies and corporations to consider relocating to the U.S., which is providing a better business environment and more or less affordable electricity bills.\n\nAnd after the destruction of Nord Stream, the economic situation on the continent will deteriorate significantly. Even though the NS-II was not launched, there was the chance of its launch, and this \"chance\" had a considerable effect on the market. Now, without its main energy supplier, Europe is doomed while America will soar.\n\nThe economic destruction of Europe makes it totally dependent on the U.S. economically, politically, and militarily, turning it into a toothless tiger with no political will and independence. At the same time, Europe will become almost completely dependent on the U.S. for its (prohibitive) gas.

Moscow held up a since-deleted tweet from a Polish politician, Radek Sikorski, that appeared to sarcastically thank the U.S. over the pipeline attack.\n\nSikorski, a former Polish minister of defense and foreign affairs, is a well-known, outspoken Kremlin-critic who for years has railed against European politicians that pursued construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany. He traveled to Washington to urge former President Trump to impose sanctions to halt the pipeline's construction.\n\n\"I was surprised, of all people, that Radek Sikorski was to hint it was the U.S.,\" Townsend said. \"I think he could have been trying to be clever and he came across as being stupid.\"\n\nSikorski could not be reached for comment by The Hill.\n\nElizabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, called Sikorski's tweet - which he later deleted - \"extremely foolish.\"\n\n\"He clearly meant to be sarcastic or ironic, but that completely misfired and has fed Russian propaganda and conspiracy theories,\" she said.\n\n\"In a situation like this, even more than in previous months and years, citizens have to be extremely careful about what they share on social media, they have to try and verify,\"Braw continued.\n\n\"Because that gives the Russians the upper hand in this sort of influence game, and they manage to steer attention away on things they have done, and cast doubt on America, or whoever their target happens to be.\"\n\nA Russian request to hold an urgent Security Council meeting to determine the culprit behind the pipeline attacks was rejected by the French, who hold the presidency of the United Nations Security Council for the month of September.\n\n\"French Presidency of the Security Council did not find an opportunity to accommodate our urgent request for convening today a UNSC meeting regarding subversive activities at the NordStream pipeline,\" Russia's mission to the U.N. tweeted. \"We are truly disappointed by this decision.\"\n\nWestern nations on Friday focused on their rejection of Putin's move to annex four regions of Ukraine despite Moscow holding a tenuous military occupation on only some of the territory.\n\nEurope and the U.S. are unlikely to take any action against Russia related to the pipeline sabotage absent the conclusion of an investigation.\n\n\"They're going to be doing a forensic investigation, presumably, trying to ascertain what caused\" the damage to the pipelines, said Scott Savitz, senior engineer at the RAND Corporation.\n\nThe time needed to carry out the investigation depends on sea conditions and the human and machine resources needed and available to collect what Savitz said should be \"incontrovertible\" evidence.\n\n\"This is substantial, [the explosions] occurred in multiple locations which will make it that much harder. Divers and specialized gear will need to be addressing multiple problems at once,\" he said.\n\nSavitz, who based his analysis on media reports, said the attack on the pipeline appeared to be \"relatively straight forward,\" with explosives somehow placed near the pipe - an action that could be as simple as pushing mines off a ship or enlisting human divers or an uncrewed undersea vehicle.\n\n\"These are heavily trafficked waters in which a ship, pushing a heavy object, or multiple, over the side would not be terribly difficult and all it would need to have is a simple setting in that it detonates after a certain time period. That's trivially easy. That's technology from a century ago if not more,\" he said.\n\n\"Conceivably based on the evidence we've seen thus far, it's not 100 percent the case that it was Russia, but it looks very probable.\"\n\nIf Russia is determined to be behind the attack, the problem for the international community is how to respond.\n\n\"I don't think we're wading into Article V territory,\" Braw said, referring to NATO treaty text that provides for collective defense, that an attack on one member is an attack on all.\n\n\"It will have to be more sanctions, even though we are running short of entities and people to sanction. That is the one area where we can do something without escalating and risking a situation where then Russia would escalate back, and that would be extremely dangerous.\"\n\nTownsend, who is also an adjunct senior fellow with the Center for a New American Security, said NATO should at least send some of its naval units as a show of support to the Danes.\n\n\"They're not big battle ships. That might be, at least initially what NATO might do, just to tell the Danes and others in the Baltic that NATO is there, NATO knows this is happening.\"\n\nTownsend added that the episode is a stark reminder that while Russia is hemorrhaging its military, economic and human resources in Ukraine, it retains the ability to keep its global adversaries in the crosshairs.\n\n\"We cannot just say, 'well we don't have to worry about Russia, they are just incompetent,'\" he said.\n\n\"Well, things haven't gone very well for them but I wouldn't call it incompetent, I'd call it evil geniuses.

According to information from SPIEGEL, a corresponding tip from the US intelligence service CIA was received in Berlin in the summer.\n\nSeveral persons familiar with the matter confirmed this. ...\n\nEven before the invasion of Ukraine, Nato partners had repeatedly pointed to suspicious activities of Russian ships over nodes of the underwater networks.\n\nHowever, an initial analysis of satellite images from the area of the incidents showed only inconspicuous ship traffic at first glance, security circles said.\n\nThe Tagesspiegel has a longer piece today trying to come up with a plausible motive for Russia. They imagine that a Russian attack might have had the purpose of allowing Gazprom to escape contractual requirements to deliver gas through Nord Stream 1, thus driving European energy prices higher. Alternatively, they propose it might've been a ruse to circumvent sanctions for the repair of the pipeline. To even retype these theses is to reveal their infirmity.\n\nThe damage is expected to be extensive, and the gas will probably continue to vent for up to two weeks. The company that operates Nord Stream 1 has not ruled out a repair attempt. Nord Stream 2 AG spokesman Ulrich Lissek told NDR that images of the venting gas suggest that \"the structural integrity of the pipeline must be massively damaged.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the German and EU officials have promised to get to the bottom of this and threatened the saboteur with sanctions.\n\nFor more, see the updates to yesterday's post.\n\nUPDATE: One speculative point I'm been thinking about, is it looks like the attacks were partially botched.
