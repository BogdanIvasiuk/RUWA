According to BBC, the regional governor's press service stated that Kirill Stremousov died in a car crash on Wednesday.\n\nAs per reports, Stremousov died in an accident on the highway between Armyansk in Crimea and Kherson. According to the Russian state media company Vesti, Stremousov was 45 years old.\n\nThe report regarding Stremousov's death was confirmed by the head of a nonprofit organization Good Peace-Crimean Volunteers, Valeria Petrusevich, who wrote on her Telegram channel that \"Kirill Stremousov, deputy governor of the Kherson region, died. The information is accurate, I know personally. It was an accident. Details later.\"\n\nKirill Stremousov was one of the most prominent proponents of Russia's occupation of the Ukrainian region and was known for aggressive statements on social media. He was quick to side with Russia despite his Ukrainian nationality when the Kherson region fell early during the Russian invasion.\n\nMoreover, he was appointed as the deputy head of the Kherson region military administration and was prominent in organizing and supporting Russia's referendum to legitimize Kherson's annexation by Russia.\n\nMore recently, Stremousov had been the driving force in the evacuation of civilians from Kerson's west bank amid Ukraine's counteroffensive against the Russian forces along the Dnipro River. For his actions supporting Russia's war efforts against Ukraine, Stremousov was wanted for treason by the Ukrainian police.\n\nMeanwhile, Kherson remains the only Ukrainian regional centre captured by Russian troops after the onset of the invasion on February 24 and is being targeted by a Ukrainian counteroffensive. As the counteroffensive continues, several indications have been made that Russian forces may abandon the city and retreat.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/n5v3ozb2qpzx92hx_1668005186.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-8166048", "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 10, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 16, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7259042314", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-11-10", "time": "23:31:00", "dateTime": "2022-11-10T23:31:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-11-10T23:26:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.843137264251709, "url": "https://www.b92.net/eng/news/world.php?yyyy=2022&mm=11&dd=09&nav_id=114828", "title": "Russian leader of Kherson was killed", "body": "The deputy head of the administration of the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, was killed, RT reports.\n\nDeputy Head of the Kherson Military-Civilian Administration, Kirill Stremousov, was killed in a traffic accident, Russian media report.\n\nStremousov, the deputy head of the region, often spoke on behalf of the regional administration, especially when it came to the situation in the city of Kherson.

Stremousov was 45 years old, according to Vesti.\n\nHis death was also announced by the Russian-appointed \"head\" of Kherson, Vladimir Saldo, who wrote in a statement on Telegram: \"It is very hard for me to say that Kirill Stremousov died today. He died on the territory of the Kherson region, moving in a car that got into an accident.\"\n\nStremousov, a Ukrainian who was quick to side with the Russian occupation when Kherson fell early in the invasion, had become one of the most vocal and outspoken of Russian appointees.\n\nAs deputy head of the Kherson region military administration, Stremousov was prominent in organizing and supporting the referendum on Kherson's illegal annexation by Russia and more recently had been the driving force in the evacuation of civilians from the west bank in Kherson, as Ukrainian forces pushed toward the Dnipro.\n\nOn Tuesday, Stremousov said: \"Most residents who decided to stay in Kherson are only now beginning to realize the gravity of the situation and my warnings.\"\n\nStremousov frequently took to Telegram to describe Ukrainian officials and forces as \"Nazis\" and \"fascists.\" But he was also critical of missteps by the Russian military. He had blamed the military setbacks in Kherson on \"incompetent commanders\" who had not been held accountable for their mistakes.\n\nLater on Wednesday, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu ordered the withdrawal of Russian forces from the west bank of the Dnipro, Russian state media reported.\n\nThis would be the most significant military development in the war since Ukrainian forces swept through the northern Kharkiv region in September. Shoigu's order came as Ukrainian forces make advances toward the city of Kherson from two directions.\n\nRussian forces have also destroyed bridges across occupied parts of the Kherson region west of the Dnipro, a local Ukrainian official and Russian military analysts on Telegram reported earlier.\n\nSkepticism and murky circumstances\n\nA Ukrainian official expressed skepticism about the reports of Stremousov's death. Yuriy Sobolevskyi, first deputy head of the Ukrainian Kherson regional council, said on Telegram: \"Regarding the information spread by the occupiers and Russian sources regarding the death of collaborator Kirill Stremousov in an accident, so far we can neither confirm nor deny the information. It may be true, or it may be staged.\"\n\nStremousov had previously had a checkered career as a local politician in Kherson, and was involved in several fracas. He also dabbled in paganism and a peculiar form of yoga. Video from 2017 showed him swinging his baby daughter around his head by her feet.\n\nStremousov is not the first Russian-backed leader to die in murky circumstances. Alexander Zakharchenko, the leader of Russian-backed separatists, was killed in the bombing of a caf\u00e9 in 2018. Several separatist commanders were also killed in a string of assassinations before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine that went unsolved.\n\nRussian and separatist leaders blamed Ukraine for the killings. Ukrainian officials in turn claimed the Moscow was eliminating troublesome local leaders. Several prominent separatists had reputed links to organized crime and some observers suggested their deaths may have also been score-settling by criminal groups.", "source": {"uri": "edition.cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_chernova@edition.cnn.com", "name": "Anna Chernova", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "darya_tarasova@edition.cnn.com", "name": "Darya Tarasova", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "tim_lister@edition.cnn.com", "name": "Tim Lister", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "uliana_pavlova@edition.cnn.com", "name": "Uliana Pavlova", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "nathan_hodge@edition.cnn.com", "name": "Nathan Hodge", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221109135202-kirill-stremousov-file-072022.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri": "eng-8166048", "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 6, "stanza_neu": 24, "stanza_pos": 1, "swn_neg": 31, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7257214677", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-11-09", "time": "16:11:00", "dateTime": "2022-11-09T16:11:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-11-09T16:11:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8078431487083435, "url": "https://www.cairnspost.com.au/news/world/deputy-governor-of-russianoccupied-kherson-dies-in-mysterious-car-crash/news-story/3624a07f7e61496442ad811cf766f6e0", "title": "Russian troops flee from key occupied city", "body": "Russia is reportedly removing its troops from the occupied Ukrainian city of Kherson.\n\nKherson, in the country's south, was the only regional capital Russia had captured since the start of the war in February.\n\nThe move comes just hours after it was announced the Moscow-installed deputy governor of the Kherson region had died in a mysterious car crash.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Russia's Ukraine commander General Sergei Surovikin had said supplying the city was no longer possible.\n\nThe bulk of the city is on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, closer to Ukrainian forces.

A portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin is on the wall behind him.\n\nKirill Stremousov, the public face of the Russian occupation of Ukraine's Kherson region, has died in a car accident, according to the collaborationist government there. The region's Moscow-installed administration head, Vladimir Saldo, announced the death Wednesday on the Telegram social media app, calling Stremousov, his acting deputy governor and occupation spokesman, \"one of the brightest.\" There were no further details about the reported death. Stremousov, Ukrainian by birth, was a 45-year-old pro-Russian propagandist known for posting voluminous videos -- often from his car. \"The 'Ukronazis,' pushed by their American masters, are forced to face certain death,\" he said in one recent video, repeating Moscow's false claims that Ukraine is run by U.S.-backed Nazis. Stremousov insisted that Russia's victory was inevitable, but that has become more difficult to sell in recent weeks as Russia suffered more defeats in the region. On Wednesday, Moscow announced it was pulling troops out of Kherson city, but the Ukrainian government said it saw no signs Russian forces were leaving without a fight. Kherson is a strategically and symbolically important regional center that fell relatively easily to the Russians early in the war.\n\nStremousov had a colorful, eccentric past. In a video he posted on YouTube in 2017, he holds his infant daughter by the arm and leg and swings her around as a form of what he calls exercise, which sparked accusations online of child abuse. Stremousov ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Kherson and the Ukrainian parliament, and became a well-known opponent of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. He initially served in the Kherson region as a Ukrainian government fisheries official. Later, he fashioned himself into a gadfly and political blogger who pressed the government to help ordinary citizens. Roman Tsviakh, a fellow civic activist, who now lives in Poland, recalled that Stremousov publicly confronted officials after some citizens fell and broke bones in an ice storm a few years back. The next day, the sidewalks were covered in salt, he recalled. \"He seemed to me to be an honest person who really wanted to work in the interest of people,\" said Volodymyr Marus, a journalist who helped train Stremousov how to work as a civic activist. But he has since changed his mind about the collaborator. Ukrainian intelligence officials and past associates told NPR that Stremousov had a thirst for wealth and began using his blog to extort money from local businesses in exchange for not publicizing their wrongdoing. Tsviakh says this behavior was not unusual, but part of Kherson's culture of corruption, which made the region an easy target for Russian infiltration in advance of the February invasion.\n\n\"People like Stremousov evolved because of a broken system,\"Tsviakh said. Stremousov allied himself with officials such as Saldo and others who publicly switched sides and backed the Russians in February. \"When the war began, all of them started to work as collaborators,\" said Marus. \"They were not pro-Russian. These were just people who wanted money. They had no sense of patriotism or purpose. They are simply traitors to Ukraine.\" Kateryna Malofieieva contributed to this story.\n\n...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-8166048", "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 24, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 30, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7257206653", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-11-09", "time": "16:05:00", "dateTime": "2022-11-09T16:05:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-11-09T16:05:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7372549176216125, "url": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-11-10/russia-orders-withdrawal-of-troops-from-urkaines-kherson-region/101636834", "title": "Russia withdraws troops from west bank of Kherson's Dnipro River", "body": "Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has ordered his troops to withdraw from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the face of Ukrainian attacks near the southern city of Kherson.\n\nThe announcement marked one of Russia's most significant retreats and a potential turning point in the war, now nearing the end of its ninth month.\n\nIn televised comments, General Sergei Surovikin, in overall command of the war, said it was no longer possible to supply Kherson city.\n\nHe said he proposed to take up defensive lines on the eastern bank of the river.\n\nThe news followed weeks of Ukrainian advances towards the city and a race by Russia to relocate more than 100,000 of its residents.\n\nMr Shoigu responded: \"I agree with your conclusions and proposals.

On Wednesday, Moscow announced it was pulling troops out of Kherson city, but the Ukrainian government said it saw no signs Russian forces were leaving without a fight. Kherson is a strategically and symbolically important regional center that fell relatively easily to the Russians early in the war.\n\nStremousov had a colorful, eccentric past. In a video he posted on YouTube in 2017, he holds his infant daughter by the arm and leg and swings her around as a form of what he calls exercise, which sparked accusations online of child abuse.\n\nStremousov ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Kherson and the Ukrainian parliament, and became a well-known opponent of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe initially served in the Kherson region as a Ukrainian government fisheries official. Later, he fashioned himself into a gadfly and political blogger who pressed the government to help ordinary citizens.\n\nRoman Tsviakh, a fellow civic activist, who now lives in Poland, recalled that Stremousov publicly confronted officials after some citizens fell and broke bones in an ice storm a few years back. The next day, the sidewalks were covered in salt, he recalled.\n\n\"He seemed to me to be an honest person who really wanted to work in the interest of people,\" said Volodymyr Marus, a journalist who helped train Stremousov how to work as a civic activist. But he has since changed his mind about the collaborator.\n\nUkrainian intelligence officials and past associates told NPR that Stremousov had a thirst for wealth and began using his blog to extort money from local businesses in exchange for not publicizing their wrongdoing. Tsviakh says this behavior was not unusual, but part of Kherson's culture of corruption, which made the region an easy target for Russian infiltration in advance of the February invasion.\n\n\"People like Stremousov evolved because of a broken system,\"Tsviakh said.\n\nStremousov allied himself with officials such as Saldo and others who publicly switched sides and backed the Russians in February.\n\n\"When the war began, all of them started to work as collaborators,\" said Marus. \"They were not pro-Russian. These were just people who wanted money. They had no sense of patriotism or purpose. They are simply traitors to Ukraine.\"", "source": {"uri": "kgou.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGOU 106.3"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aadaadc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3827x2009+0+216/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.npr.org%2Fassets%2Fimg%2F2022%2F11%2F09%2Fgettyimages-1242010244_custom-1d393e6b7f842a345bf4be3b2fd9b2e287d83bba.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-8166048", "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 4, "stanza_neu": 20, "stanza_pos": 2, "swn_neg": 26, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 1, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7257143612", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-11-09", "time": "15:11:00", "dateTime": "2022-11-09T15:11:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-11-09T14:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7098039388656616, "url": "https://tass.com/emergencies/1534337", "title": "Acting Kherson Regional governor confirms death of his deputy in car crash", "body": "Vladimir Saldo added that Kirill Stremousov was one of the brightest personalities whom he described as \"an articulate speaker capable of telling people the truth about what is happening in the Kherson Region\"\n\nKHERSON, November 9. /TASS/.

A true hero. Kherson must be defended at all costs. Kherson is what keeps Russia in power today.\"\n\nReports on pro-Russian social media channels painted a gloomy picture of situation in Kherson, with some suggesting Moscow may even be preparing to abandon the largest city it occupies in Ukraine.\n\nDespite sending substantial reinforcements to the region since the summer, Moscow's forces on the west bank of the river have become increasingly in danger of being trapped by the Ukrainian advance on a broad front.\n\nIn recent weeks, Russia been transporting civilians away from Kherson as the Ukrainian threat to the occupied city has drawn ever closer, amid reports this week that some private ferries used by civilians for evacuation have also been sunk.\n\nAleksandr Kots, a journalist with the pro-Kremlin Komsomolskaya Pravda tabloid, who is in Kherson, said there was \"no good news\" there, suggesting that the announcement of withdrawal could come soon.\n\n\"We are waiting for an official announcement,\" he wrote on his Telegram channel. Kots also posted several videos from Kherson that he said showed Russian flags removed from government buildings.\n\nAccording to some accounts, the occupation administration in Kherson has been relocated well to the south of the city.\n\nSergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser and political commentator said that the decision to leave Kherson would have \"catastrophic consequences\".\n\n\"In Russia, many fear that the decision to leave Kherson has already been made. It is the wrong decision. It could have catastrophic consequences for Russia.\"\n\nUkrainian officials have warned in recent days that claims that Russian forces are preparing to withdraw may be a ruse, suggesting that some Russian troops were disguising themselves as civilians.\n\nVictory in Kherson, one of the key objectives of Kyiv's southern offensive, would be a devastating blow to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, only weeks after a high-profile ceremony in Moscow in which he announced the annexation of Kherson oblast along with three other regions.\n\nThe destruction of the bridges, however, suggests that at the very least Russian forces may be preparing to abandon the positions that they occupy on western side of the Dnieper River.\n\nUkrainian officials and local residents said that at least four bridges had been blown up on Wednesday to slow the Ukrainian advance. Among therse was the Dariivka bridge, the only crossing across the Inhulets river in the Russian-occupied western-bank part of Kherson oblast.\n\nThe Inhulets divides the occupied area into two, with the city of Kherson in the western part and Beryslav in the east.\n\nImages posted on social media also showed two bridges over the canal in Snihurivka had collapsed.

The information is accurate, I know personally. It was an accident. Details later.\"\n\nThis comes after several media reports that Russian forces have destroyed the bridges across the occupied parts of Ukraine's Kherson region west of the Dnipro River, CNN reported.\n\nSerhii Khlan, a member of the Ukrainian Kherson Regional Council, said that Russian forces appear to be staging a tactical retreat from some frontline villages to \"slow down the onslaught of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\" CNN cannot independently confirm his claims.\n\n\"The occupiers blew up not only Dariivskyi and Tiahynskyi bridges, they also blew up the bridge at the exit from Snihurivka towards Kherson across the canal,\" Khlan said during a press conference. \"They blew up the bridge in Novokairy, blew up the bridge in My love.\"\n\n\"The occupiers are now blowing up absolutely all bridges\" in the occupied Kherson region west of the Dnipro River, according to CNN.\n\nImages and reports from Russian propagandists and military analysts on Telegram appear to corroborate those claims.\n\nA popular Russian military analysis channel said on Wednesday that \"the destruction of bridges across the Kherson Front began to slow down the advance of the AFU [Armed Forces of Ukraine].\"\n\nKhlan said that Russian forces were withdrawing \"en masse\" from frontline villages along the western bank of the Dnipro River. He said that though it was not yet possible to officially say that Russia had abandoned the settlements, Russian forces were no longer present in Kachkarivka, Mylove, Novokairy, Berezynske, Sukhanove, Chervonyi Yar, Piatykhatky and Sadok, reported CNN.

Authorities have not shared any further details surrounding the incident. There have been conflicting reports on where the fatal crash took place, with some sources alleging that he died near the port city of Henichesk along the Sea of Azov.\n\nUkrainian authorities have systematically targeted Ukrainians accused of collaborating with Russian forces in a string of high-profile assassinations. Oleg Boyko, deputy head of the Berdyansk military-civilian administration for housing and communal services, was killed near his garage along with his wife in September. Vladimir Saldo, the head of Russian-occupied Kherson, was previously hospitalized in Crimea as part of a purported poisoning plot. There is, however, currently no indication that Ukraine played any part in Stremousov's death. Saldo, who returned to Kherson shortly after the poisoning attempt, confirmed reports of Stremousov's death and said the official left behind five children, according to the BBC.\n\nStremousov, forty-five, was a blogger and local political activist associated with the Socialist Party of Ukraine, an organization banned by the Ukrainian government in June 2022. Stremousov espoused a stridently pro-Russian position during the invasion of Ukraine and was appointed by the Kremlin as deputy head of the Kherson Regional Administration in April. He was accused by Ukrainian authorities of treason for his role in aiding the Russian occupation forces. The occupation official posted regular updates on Telegram, denouncing Ukrainian forces as \"Nazis\" and \"fascists\" whilst also criticizing Russia's missteps in the war. Stremeousov lashed out at top Russian defense officials last month over Ukraine's battlefield successes, claiming that Russia's Defense Ministry consists of \"mediocre and corrupt generals and looters,\" according to Newsweek. \"Many people say that the Minister of Defense, who allowed this state of affairs to happen, could, as an officer, shoot himself,\" he added, referring to Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.\n\nStremeousov became a key local figure in Russia's recent efforts to evacuate the city of Kherson amid a Ukrainian offensive in the region. In his last Telegram post, dated to Wednesday morning, Stremousov expressed optimism in the continued ability of Russian forces to repel Ukrainian assaults on Kherson. \"At this stage, the situation is under full control of the Russian military,\" he wrote. Russia's overall commander in Ukraine, Gen. Sergei Surovikin, announced later that day the decision was made to withdraw Russian troops from the city.", "source": {"uri": "nationalinterest.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National Interest"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/Car%20Kherson.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-8166048", "sentiment": -0.6470588235294117, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1, "stanza_neg": 6, "stanza_neu": 14, "stanza_pos": 0, "swn_neg": 20, "swn_neu": 0, "swn_pos": 0, "title_stanza_sent": 0, "title_swn_sent": 0}, {"uri": "7258158779", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2022-11-10", "time": "10:27:00", "dateTime": "2022-11-10T10:27:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2022-11-10T09:32:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "url": "https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2022/11/ukraine-221109-rferl02.htm", "title": "Top Russian-Installed Official In Ukraine's Kherson Region Reportedly Dies In Car Crash", "body": "The Russian-installed deputy governor of Ukraine's Kherson region, one of the highest profile occupation figures, has reportedly died in a traffic accident.\n\nRussian pro-Kremlin military reporter Semyon Pegov, blogger Boris Rozhin, and the RIA-Novosti state news agency quoted the Russian-installed administration of the Kherson region as saying that the traffic accident on November 9 that killed Kirill Stremousov occurred near the city of Henichesk.\n\nMoscow and Russian-installed officials in Kherson have said for weeks that they are pushing residents of Kherson to move to \"other parts of the Russian Federation.\"\n\nAfter Russian troops took control of parts of the Kherson region and the regional capital, Kherson, in March, Stremousov had been the major spokesman of the Russian-installed authorities there.\n\nHe was the first person to announce Russia's decision to annex the region, along with three other Ukrainian regions, parts of which are under the control of Russian troops, via so-called \"referendums\" in September.\n\nBefore Russia launched its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in late February, Stremousov was a Ukrainian politician. He was known for his pro-Russia stance and the pro-Moscow public events he organized in the region. He was an active member of pro-Russia movements and parties in the region for years.\n\nStremousov unsuccessfully tried to get elected to the Ukrainian parliament in 2019 and to the post of mayor of Kherson in 2020.\n\nSince Russia launched its attack on Ukraine, there have been several assassination attempts conducted against Moscow-appointed officials in Kherson and other territories occupied by Russian troops.\n\nSeveral officials are reported to have been killed, though in September, the Russian-appointed deputy mayor of the city of Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region, Vitaliy Hura, and the city's de facto deputy police chief, Serhiy Tomko, turned out to be alive after their deaths were widely reported.\n\nThey said in televised interviews that their assassinations were faked by Russia's Federal Security Service to thwart potential attempts on their lives allegedly being planned by Ukrainian intelligence.\n\nReports about Stremousov's death come as Ukrainian armed forces continue their counteroffensive against Russian troops.\n\nKherson is considered by many military analysts as the most important of the four partially occupied Ukrainian regions that Russia announced as annexed in September.\n\nIt controls both the only land route to the Crimean Peninsula and the mouth of the Dnieper River that bisects Ukraine.\n\nSource: https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-kherson-stremousov- dies-car-crash-ukriane/32122726.html\n\nCopyright (c) 2022.

Gen. Sergei Surovikin, the overall commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, said he proposed to take up defensive lines on the eastern bank of the river.\n\nThe announcement came after Ukrainian officials said Russians forces were deliberately blowing up bridges around the city.\n\n\"The occupiers are currently undermining absolutely all the bridges on the right bank of the Kherson region,\" Serhii Khlan, the deputy head of Kherson's regional council, said in a Telegram post.\n\nUkrainian and Russian forces clashed overnight in the town Snihurivka, around 30 miles north of Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-installed deputy civilian administrator of the Kherson region, said in a post on his Telegram channel.\n\nCiting the local administration, some Russian state media reported that Stremousov had died in a road accident on Wednesday, although some outlets later appeared to suggest it was too early to tell whether he had been killed.\n\nStremousov had posted regular video updates on social media -- including while in vehicles moving at speed -- about the situation on the frontline.\n\nNews of his death came as several pro-Kremlin bloggers criticized the decision to withdraw.\n\nRussia has fought for months to hang on to the pocket of land it holds on the west bank of the river that bisects Ukraine, as well as Kherson city, the only major Ukrainian city that Russian forces have captured intact since the invasion began Feb. 24.\n\nMoscow declared at the end of September that it had annexed Kherson, along with the Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzia regions after staging referendums that were denounced by Kyiv and the West as illegal and rigged.\n\nAnd it has poured in tens of thousands of troops as reinforcements in the region, which is also home to the huge Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnieper. The dam holds back an enormous reservoir and controls the water supply to the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.\n\nHowever, late last month, Russian-installed authorities ordered residents to leave the city, saying in a statement on their Telegram channel that they should board boats across the Dnieper river. They added that all departments and ministries of the Kremlin-installed administration should also evacuate to escape advancing Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe Ukrainian military has targeted the main river crossings for months, making it difficult for Russia to supply its huge force on the river's west bank.
