While GlobalSecurity.org takes utmost care to accurately report this news story, we cannot independently verify the authenticity of all statements, photos and videos.\n\nOn 24 February 2022, Ukraine was suddenly and deliberately attacked by land, naval and air forces of Russia, igniting the largest European war since the Great Patriotic War. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" (SVO - spetsialnaya voennaya operatsiya) in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the \"Donbass republics\" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.\n\n\"To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.\" [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence reported that since 10 October, Russia has attacked Ukraine with a campaign of strikes targeting electric power infrastructure. To date, this action has come in waves. The most recent intense strikes were on 31 October, which involved targeting hydroelectric dam facilities for the first time. The strikes have resulted in widespread damage to transmission stations and power plants. Scheduled and emergency blackouts have become routine in parts of Ukraine, with Kyiv notably impacted.\n\nRecoverability varies, and the impacts of strikes are unlikely to be felt uniformly. Continued degradation of networks by Russian strikes will almost certainly have consequences for interlinked water and heating systems, that will be most significantly felt by the civilian population during winter, as demand increases.\n\nRussian strikes on power generation and transmission are having a disproportionate effect upon civilians in Ukraine, indiscriminately impacting critical functions such as healthcare and heating. The continued prioritisation of critical national infrastructure over military targets strongly implies Russian intent to strike at civilian morale.\n\nThe General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that Ukrainian defense forces continue to liberate Ukrainian lands in the Kherson direction. In the course of successful offensive actions, advanced units of Ukrainian troops have already reached the right bank of the Dnieper in some places. Measures to identify and destroy Russian forces in a number of settlements are ongoing. Due to the safety of the operation, the official release of the results will be provided at a later date.\n\nRussia is concentrating its efforts on restraining the actions of the Defense Forces in certain directions, improving the fortification equipment of the defensive lines on the left bank of the Dnieper and in the north of the temporarily occupied territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. At the same time, it conducts offensive operations in the Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Novopavlivka directions.\n\nDuring the current day, Russian forces launched 3 missile and 9 air strikes, carried out more than 10 attacks from rocket salvo systems. Areas of populated areas of Kharkiv, Donetsk, Vinnytsia, Kherson and Mykolaiv oblasts suffered Russian attacks.\n\nThe situation in the Volyn and Polissya directions has not changed significantly. The Republic of Belarus continues to support the armed aggression of the russian federation against Ukraine, providing it with infrastructure, territory and airspace. The formation of the russian-belarusian grouping of troops on the territory of the Republic of Belarus continues. There is still a threat of the Russian forces launching missile and air strikes from the territory and airspace of Ukraine.\n\nThe enemy shelled in such other directions:\n\nAccording to detailed information, the destruction of a Russian Mi-8 helicopter was confirmed in the area of the settlement of Dniprovka, Zaporizhzhia oblast. In the area of the city of Enerhodar, a Russian control post was hit - more than 50 occupants were killed and more than 40 were wounded. A Ka-52 helicopter was also destroyed.\n\nAs a result of accurate strikes by the Ukrainian Defense Forces on the headquarters of the Russian occupying forces in the settlement of Chervony Mayak, Kherson oblast, more than 30 occupants were killed, 2 tanks and 4 trucks were destroyed.\n\nDuring the current 24 hours, the Ukrainian aviation carried out 5 strikes on areas where Russia personnel, weapons and military equipment are concentrated. During the current day, soldiers of the missile troops and artillery of the Ukrainian Defense Forces hit the command post, 2 areas of concentration of manpower, weapons and military equipment, 2 ammunition warehouses and 3 other important Russian military objects.\n\nThe Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation announced the completion of the withdrawal of military units to the left bank of the Dnieper at 5 am on November 11. The Russian fighters did not leave a single piece of military equipment behind them, and also did not suffer losses despite shelling from the enemy. Assistance was provided to all civilians who wished to cross to the left bank.\n\nThe armed forces of Ukraine fired five times at the crossings across the Dnieper. As a result of the work of the air defense forces (Air Defense), 28 shells were shot down. The movement of advanced enemy units at that moment was stopped 30-40 kilometers from the coast due to mine barriers, as well as the work of artillery and aviation.\n\nIn total, more than 30,000 people and over 5,000 units of military equipment, including those that are subject to repair, have been withdrawn. On the accumulations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the right bank, a fire defeat was inflicted.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Kupyansky, Limansky and Donetsk directions, the Armed Forces of Ukraine lost more than 275 soldiers, 3 tanks, 10 units of light armored vehicles and 5 vehicles during the day.\n\nAlso hit were 9 command posts of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, an ammunition depot, 52 artillery units and 176 areas of accumulation of manpower and equipment. In the Zolochev area, the M777 battery was suppressed, and near Nevsky, the Akatsy platoon was suppressed. Ukrainian Air Force Mi-8 was shot down over Mirovka.\n\nAir defense forces intercepted 7 drones, 32 rockets and 5 anti-radar missiles.\n\nMeanwhile, in the border regions of the Russian Federation, the construction of defensive fortifications, called the \"Wagner Line\", continues. These defensive structures stretch from the territory of the Donbass to the Belgorod region and are necessary in case of an unforeseen breakthrough by the enemy. The military correspondents of the FAN visited the construction site and learned from the fighters of the PMC \"Wagner\" details about the progress of the work.\n\nThe situation in the Donbass\n\nThe Armed Forces of Ukraine attempted an attack on Zaitsevo and Otradovka, using drones for reconnaissance in the area of Klescheevka-Zaitsevo-Experimental.

General Sergei Surovikin, commander of the Russian forces in Ukraine, confirmed they will withdraw to defensive positions along the Dnipro River, citing re-supply issues as the primary reason for the decision.\n\nRussia's ability to sustain its forces on the west bank of the Dnipro river had been placed under pressure by Ukrainian strikes on Russia's resupply routes. In retreating, Russian forces have destroyed multiple bridges and likely laid mines to slow and delay advancing Ukrainian forces. The loss of Kherson's west bank will likely prevent Russia from achieving its strategic aspiration of a land bridge reaching Odesa.\n\nWith limited crossing points, Russian forces will be vulnerable in crossing the Dnipro River. It is likely that the withdrawal will take place over several days with defensive positions and artillery fires covering withdrawing forces.\n\nThe General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that according to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, during the past day, in the direction of Petropavlivka-Novoraisk, units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine advanced 7 kilometers and took control of 6 settlements.
