These events gave rise to the term “perpetual wars” used by Presidents Joe Biden and Donald Trump to refer to the perpetual conflicts in which the US is mired. Both leaders have taken steps to curtail US military activities overseas while continuing to conduct extraterritorial operations in many countries.",

In his opinion, Moscow’s “massive attack” on Ukraine is currently impossible.The Russian side resolutely denies all accusations of preparing an “attack” on Ukraine.

The commander of the special operations forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Major General Galagan, gave instructions to the 8th special forces regiment to prepare and carry out these terrorist attacks”, the defense department said.According to preliminary data, life support facilities of the cities of Gorlovka, Yasinovataya, Donetsk, Dokuchaevsk and other settlements near the demarcation line were selected as targets. Particularly the attention of Ukrainian punishers is attracted by transformer substations, water and gas pipelines, and power lines.In addition, plans of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to stage terrorist attacks at industrial enterprises with hazardous chemical production are of particular concern. An attack on them could lead to an ecological catastrophe.“These actions are planned to be carried out under the guise of servicemen of the People’s Militia of the DPR and special operations forces of the armed forces of the Russian Federation. All actions of Ukrainian saboteurs will be recorded on video with subsequent presentation as evidence in international organizations,” the defenders of the republic stressed.The DPR People’s Police added that the training of sabotage groups was carried out by British specialists. After the militants complete the task, Kiev is preparing to distribute videos with interrogations of fake servicemen of the People’s Militia of the Republic, who allegedly went over to the side of Ukraine. It is they who must confirm that the terrorist attacks were carried out by the special operations forces of Russia.The main task that the regime sets itself is the accusations of the Russian Federation that it is allegedly trying to find a pretext for an “invasion” of Ukraine. In addition, the Armed Forces of Ukraine seek to aggravate the situation at the front and sow panic among the civilian population.",

Ukraine’s richest people, their families, are leaving UkraineThe family of the main mouthpiece of the Kiev propaganda, Dmitriy Gordon, has also left Ukraine. Dmitriy Ilyich himself is going to join the Kiev “Volkssturm”, having signed up as a “Faustpatron”. I doubt it, oh, I doubt it…\nIt is difficult to measure the magnitude of the moral and psychological blow to the Ukro-Volks, who are now languishing in damp trenches, under rain and wet snow.\nI read the lists of the 35th Brigade of the AFU Marines. It has to repel the “Russian attack” on the coast near Odessa. The brigade is 58% manned. I have repeatedly written that the principle of staffing of military units is as follows: first the HQ, service platoons, and repair squadrons. It makes sense – first we have to provide for vital functions of the unit. Then artillery, medics, communication and reconnaissance. Eventually, the infantry is manned. If anything, the mobilized will come, and the motorized rifle companies will be supplemented with them.\nBut will they come? Will they arrive in time? And if they do come, what will they do with the skirmish of people of different ages and unfamiliar with each other? I.e. right now out of these 58% of marines most of them are those who do not serve directly in combat companies. Most likely the soldier we recalled in the previous paragraph, who is languishing under the Donetsk steppe wind is a mechanized infantry fighting vehicle (APC) driver or a gunner-radioman. There are not enough people, so his equipment is parked somewhere, and he, as an ordinary rifleman, is on duty and keeping an eye on the American “thermals” – are the Chechens cutting his head off?\n“A teepee is a good thing, but what is he supposed to do when the offensive begins? Should he run to a dugout for a British NLAW grenade launcher or to flee to the rear to start the BMP? Should he just run? “Everybody else ran, am I any better?” The main thing is to run to the Polish zone of occupation. They will give you refugee status and the opportunity to work in Europe. You can even use grants from émigré organizations to write memoirs about how they burned hundreds of Buryat tanks in defence of Europe and its values.\nWhile the soldier is thinking, the most interesting thing is happening in the rear. They are already stealing everything there, without much hiding. Why fight for some failed country, if you can build your own paradise? And suddenly a Ukrainian official realizes that the invasion of Russia is to his personal advantage, because the war will pay for everything!

This was stated by the author of the American magazine Time Simon Schuster on Twitter.Referring to people close to the Ukrainian president, Shuster said that Zelensky regrets that he tried to take advantage of anti-Russian sentiment in the West, wanting to profit.“A source close to Zelensky told me that for the first time the United States warned his team about a Russian invasion last fall, indicating an 80% probability. The Ukrainians did not believe in this, but they saw the prospect – “more help, more attention” – and played along. Now they regret . There is too much attention”, he said.In recent months, the United States and other NATO members have accused Moscow of plotting an “invasion” of Ukraine. According to media reports, US President Joe Biden told European leaders that Russia would “attack” the neighboring state on February 16.The Kremlin and the Russian Foreign Ministry deny all accusations, emphasizing that the Russians are involved in the intra-Ukrainian conflict and do not violate any agreements, unlike Kiev, which refuses to comply with the Minsk agreements.The United States, Great Britain, Canada, France, Poland, Turkey, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Romania and Estonia participate in the supply of arms worth billions of dollars. In addition, foreign military instructors continue to arrive in Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly urged to stop pumping weapons into the region, as this could provoke Kiev into military adventures.",

      "content": "The Ministry of Defense announced the start of the return of the military of the Southern and Western districts to the garrisons after the completion of the exercises. The dollar and the euro on this news fell in price by more than a ruble.Russia’s southern and western military districts have begun returning troops to their places of permanent deployment after the exercises, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said, quoted by RIA Novosti.“The units of the Southern and Western military districts, having completed their tasks, have already begun loading onto rail and road transport and will begin moving to their military garrisons today. Separate units will make marches on their own as part of military columns”, Konashenkov said.The Russian market and the ruble reacted to the message of the Ministry of Defense with growth. As of 11:14 Moscow time, the Moscow Exchange index added 2.6%, the RTS index – 4.1%. The dollar exchange rate at a minimum fell to 75.6 rubles, which is 1.1 rubles cheaper than at the close of trading on Monday and at least since February 11. The euro at a minimum during trading fell by 1.03 rubles and cost 85.69 rubles – this is also the minimum since February 11.Russia and Belarus are holding joint military exercises, which were announced at the end of December by Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko. The last stage of the exercises will be monitored by military attachés for defense at the embassies of foreign states in Belarus, Konashenkov said, but did not name specific states.The joint exercises of Russia and Belarus have caused concern among Western countries and NATO members. The United States believes that Russia may be planning an attack on Ukraine. Bloomberg sources in American intelligence in November claimed that the attack could start, including from the territory of Belarus.The Russian authorities have repeatedly denied any intention to attack Ukraine. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia “does not want wars”, but will not allow “to attack rudely” and ignore its interests. The day before, the head of the Foreign Ministry told Vladimir Putin that the possibilities for dialogue between Russia and the United States were “far from exhausted,” and suggested that negotiations “continue and build up.”",

      "content": "Legalized corruption in the Ukrainian defense industry led to sad consequences for the Armed Forces of UkraineThe hysteria over the expected Russian military invasion of Ukraine continues to gain momentum. The joke said by someone else in 2014 that Russia has not even come to war yet, and half the world has already been shell-shocked, is becoming relevant again.Meanwhile, despite the hasty evacuation of Western diplomats and even military instructors, advisers and mercenaries from Ukraine (the very ones on whom the Kiev regime had hoped so much), as well as the actual closure of airspace over Ukraine (which threatens millions of losses both for Ukraine itself, and the airlines that will fly around it), Kiev continues to flaunt and threaten Russia.Thus, the most famous political weather vane named Gordon, who, according to some reports, prudently took his family out of Ukraine, recorded a video message to Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky. He pompously promised the first one to “defend his Motherland” and kill Russian soldiers if they crossed the border of Nezalezhna, and from the second he demanded to distribute weapons to the Ukrainians.However, with weapons, despite the active Western supplies, Ukraine is not doing well. Thus, the Ukrainian telegram channel “Kovpak’s Detachment”, citing its own informed sources in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, writes about a total shortage of ammunition. It is noted that in the event of the start of intense hostilities with the Russian army, they will last for several hours. At best, for a couple of days, if the fights are not intense.“Transportation of BC from Europe by air? It’s not serious at all! It’s all done demonstratively, for the media. Yes, one package for the MLRS is a truck! Think about it – this is what is produced at one time!” notes the interlocutor of the TG channel “Kovpak’s Detachment”.According to a source in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in order to provide the Ukrainian military with sufficient ammunition, they should be delivered not by military transport aircraft, but by whole railway trains, which is currently not observed. In addition, a certain problem for such deliveries is the difference in the width of the railway track in Europe and Ukraine, which significantly complicates logistics and may even threaten to paralyze the railway communication. In addition, one should take into account the difference in calibers between Soviet weapons, which still prevail in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and NATO ones.“It’s not clear where to get ammunition in such a quantity of such calibers in Europe,” an officer of the Armed Forces of Ukraine complains. “Even if the Soviet ones are still preserved somewhere, after decades they are extremely unreliable. Say, mortar mines – at best, every third explodes. And if we are talking about a full-fledged war, these ammunition will obviously not be enough.”However, not everything is so smooth with NATO weapons. So, photos of expired Stinger man-portable anti-aircraft missile systems delivered to Ukraine from Lithuania are distributed on the network. Thus, on boxes with missiles, the date of production is indicated – December 2010, while the storage period of this type of ammunition set by the manufacturer is 10 years, after which they are subject to disposal. It turns out that the cunning Balts decided to dispose of their expired “stingers” in such an uncomplicated way. Whether they will shoot or not, or even detonate in the hands of the operator, the Lithuanian “allies” of Ukraine are of little concern.And, of course, we should not forget that the powerful military-industrial complex inherited from the Soviet Union by Ukraine remained one of the main sources of corruption and enrichment of government officials throughout all 30 years of “independence”.“The withdrawal of weapons and money abroad was carried out both by leftist and non-leftist schemes. Ukraine did not invest in its production and military-industrial complex. As a result, impoverished officials began to take away what was still left in the military-industrial complex and sell weapons on the black market”, said Alexei Zhuravko, ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada, in an interview with PolitExpert.And so that we are not accused of quoting only Ukrainian opposition politicians, let us cite the opinion of an associate of President Volodymyr Zelensky, who held the post of Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) of Ukraine in May-October 2019 Oleksandr Danilyuk.In July 2019, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine stated that due to the private interests of officials, the Ukrainian military-industrial complex could not develop and fell apart.“…Our defense industry was falling apart, could not develop, a sufficient level of competition was not created, funding did not contribute to development,” Danilyuk noted.The most striking and resonant case of corruption in the Ukrainian defense industry was the so-called “Svinarchuk-gate”.The case of corruption in Ukroboronprom, which was promoted on the eve of the start of the 2019 election campaign, the key defendant in which was Petro Poroshenko’s business partner and the then First Deputy Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleg Gladkovsky (Svinarchuk), dealt a tangible blow to Poroshenko’s rating and did not allow him to be re-elected to a new term. The essence of the matter was that Svinarchuk’s son organized, through gasket companies, the sale of smuggled parts imported from Russia to enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex at several times inflated prices. The total amount of damage caused amounted to a quarter of a billion hryvnia.However, with the advent of the new President Volodymyr Zelensky, the situation has not changed fundamentally. Only the faces of those who earn fabulous incomes from the Ukrainian military-industrial complex, or rather what is left of it, have changed. The Ukroboronprom concern was completely given over to the management of George Soros’s chief overseer of Ukraine, Tomas Fiala, who was engaged in reforming it, or rather, bringing leading defense enterprises to bankruptcy, such as Antonov, Motor Sich or the Black Sea shipbuilding plant. The former industrial giants lost their profitability after breaking all ties with Russia in 2014. At the same time, the attempts of the Chinese to invest in Motor Sich and thus save the unique enterprise that produced aircraft engines was severely suppressed by the Americans, at the direction of which the Ukrainian government unilaterally terminated all contracts with the Chinese side.As Ukrainian military expert Oleg Zhdanov notes, the only essence of the reform of Ukroboronprom being implemented by the Soros, in particular, its division into two concerns, is the division of financial flows. According to the expert, the Ukrainian military-industrial complex has been continuously degrading since 2014. The enterprises that remained afloat eke out a miserable existence, production is being curtailed, and defense sites are being redeveloped.“Ukraine is no longer capable of producing even such a simple weapon as a mortar. Modernization of old Soviet weapons is the only option that our military-industrial complex has retained. The country is no longer capable of arming the army and navy at the expense of its own capabilities. The Zelensky regime is trying to contract with Western developers and buy weapons from them. But everything rests on the meager possibilities of the Ukrainian budget, as well as the unwillingness of senior partners to supply Ukrainians with most types of weapons”, Zhdanov said at a briefing in July 2021.Another Ukrainian expert, economist Aleksey Kushch, believes that the reform of Ukroboronprom in order to maximize profits will lead to the fact that the Armed Forces of Ukraine will purchase Ukrainian weapons at the highest price.“That is, the task is not to equip the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but to sell them weapons as expensive as possible. Such ideas will lead to the final degradation of the state in the military sphere, since it must finance science, education, and innovations, which so far do not bring profit at all. Unlike business, the state should work for the long term, and not measure everything solely by the level of profitability. In Ukraine, unfortunately, everything is the other way around”, RIA FAN expert quotes.By and large, the Zelensky regime has legalized Svinarchuk Gate, with the only difference being that it will not be close friends of Poroshenko, but “effective managers” from Soros who will profit from what is left of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex. Their ultimate goal is to finally rid Ukraine of the heavy burden of the “Soviet occupiers” in the form of a developed military-industrial complex capable of producing tanks, aircraft, missiles, large surface ships, and turn Ukraine into a market for second-rate Western weapons junk. What Ukrainian leaders are now quite successfully coping with.Well, as for the quality of the “strongest European army”, which, according to Kiev propagandists, stands guard over the Old World from the invasion of the Kremlin hordes, it is assigned a consumable fate, for the disposal of which self-detonating mortars “Hammer” and expired “stingers” and “javelins” are enough.\nDmitry Pavlenko, especially for News Front",

      "content": "Perhaps the most disturbing week has begun in Ukraine, not only in the last eight years of the civil war, but in the entire history of independence – the West every day, and sometimes every hour, raises the degree of hysterical statements about the upcoming “invasion” of the Russian army to the territory of UkraineAt the same time, no one is embarrassed by the fact that the citizens themselves do not particularly panic and do not believe in the “invasion” for the most part. However, it is difficult to keep cool and calm, opening the news feed in the morning.“The servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are urgently called back from vacations and canceled for an indefinite period.”“Commissions have been created in Kiev to deal with the evacuation of the population”, said the mayor of the capital, Vitali Klitschko, during a briefing, noting that two centers of territorial defense will be created in the capital.“Ukraine temporarily closed entry on February 10 for all men – citizens of the Russian Federation of military age, in order to avoid provocations.”“Separatist Kostya Bedovoy, on the instructions of the FSB, is preparing provocations against the Ukrainian authorities.”“The main staff of the US Embassy in Ukraine has already moved from Kiev to Lviv.”“From February 14 to February 19, 2022, the police personnel were transferred to an enhanced duty regime”, reports the head of the National Police Ihor Klymenko.“France temporarily closes the lyceum at its embassy in Kiev.”And the list of countries that evacuate their diplomats – some to Lviv, some – to their homeland, and every hour the list is getting longer, without adding peace to the citizens of Ukraine.Recall that last week Joe Biden and the Western media even named the date for the start of the war – February 16, after which panic began, only not in Ukraine, but in the West.It would seem, well, let the West panic if the “partners” do not have enough thrills in life, but this has the most detrimental effect on Ukraine.The first is the threat of stopping international air traffic. International insurance companies, frightened of a full-scale war, refused to give guarantees for flights to Ukraine – they decided to play it safe so that later they would not pay millions of euros of insurance for aircraft damaged during hostilities. The situation seems to have been partially resolved, the Cabinet of Ministers allocated 16.6 billion hryvnias (about $600 million) for insurance of flights over the territory of Ukraine, this money will be kept on a special account of the Ministry of Infrastructure and used to guarantee flight safety for insurance companies, reinsurers, lessors and air carriers. Western panic costs Ukraine dearly. But this is not all financial losses. And in the matter of air traffic, not everything is going smoothly. So, for example, the largest airline in Ukraine UIA, at the request of the lessor, is forced to start mass removal of aircraft abroad – for storage at the airports of Serbia and Spain, until better times. Not everyone believed in Ukraine’s guarantees.The second consequence of the hysteria raised by the Western media is the mass dumping of Ukrainian Eurobonds. This was followed by another fall of the Ukrainian national currency – the hryvnia.Against this background, the SBU was forced to issue a statement announcing that Ukraine was faced with unprecedented attempts to whip up panic, “spread fakes and distort the real state of things.”“The motives for the current information pressure are to sow alarm in Ukrainian society, undermine faith in the ability of the state to protect its citizens, and undermine our unity. We all should remain calm and cool mind, not succumb to provocations. Panic and destabilization only benefit the enemy, not Ukraine. We should not forget that the strength of Ukraine is not only in a powerful army, but also in the unity of each of us. Together we are able to protect Ukraine, our freedom, independence and dignity,” the SBU said in a statement.But the SBU did not name the main culprits of the “information pressure” – the media of Western partners.The Ministry of Internal Affairs also tried to calm the citizens, some of whom are already starting to get a little worried, though they did it in a very peculiar way, promising that “special forces will shoot all enemies.”According to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, Denis Monastyrsky, 300,000 policemen, national guardsmen, rescuers and border guards stand guard over internal security every day and, if an enemy appears, they will be shot on the spot, and therefore “keep calm, the situation is under control.” Agree, this can hardly be called a calming signal.On Monday, an urgent meeting of the National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) of Ukraine was held in Kiev on the same issue – “Russian invasion”.After the meeting, NSDC Secretary Oleksiy Danilov made a statement.“We are aware of the risks that exist on the territory of our country, but the situation is absolutely under control. Moreover, today we do not see that a large-scale offensive of the Russian Federation can take place either on February 16, or on February 17. We do not see this,” Danilov announced.Danilov, perhaps, does not see. But the prime minister British Minister Boris Johnson knows for sure that Russia could attack Ukraine within the next 48 hours.\n“This is a very, very dangerous and difficult situation. We are on the brink of an abyss, but President Putin still has time to take a step back,” Johnson said at the same time as Danilov.\nMeanwhile, the American television company CNN is trying to somehow explain in advance the fact that the previously widely publicized “offensive” of the Russian army will once again be thwarted. They didn’t think up much, and this time the weather turned out to be to blame for everything – indecently warm for winter.\nRecall that Western experts based the forecast about the beginning of the war on February 16 on the fact that the earth at that time would freeze to the maximum depth. But the weather decided to argue with the experts, and spring suddenly came to the East of Ukraine. Well, what an offensive in the spring – not to pass, not to pass. Will we have to wait with the “invasion”?\nRoman Katerinchuk, One Motherland",

      "content": "War hysteria in the Vistula media reached its peak. Since maintaining tension requires a constant escalation of the virtual threat, we are flooded day by day with a stream of idiocy that is becoming more stupid and out of touch with reality.Let me give you an example: since yesterday, some women with a tremor in their voices have been reporting that invaluable oligarchs are leaving Ukraine. Only on Sunday, about 20 private and charter aircraft took off from Kiev. Financial vampires in Kiev are monitored by various EU and Anglo-Saxon agencies, which are largely responsible for the current state of this unfortunate country.If this is bad news for Ukrainians, it’s hard to imagine what the good news will be. If the aforementioned refugees took the main neo-Nazis Stefan Bandera with them, Ukraine could soon become a relatively friendly place to live. However, I wouldn’t believe it too much.Meanwhile, the vile security officer Putin, as luck would have it, cannot get his way. Maliciously, he doesn’t drop bombs, he doesn’t bring tanks into the field. And yet, since the beginning of the year, we have been hearing that Russia will attack within a week at the latest. Or during the Olympics. Or right after the Olympic Games… And so on. These platitudes are piously repeated by home-grown experts and people who call themselves journalists. Completely unaware that their previous prophecies proved to be as accurate as the doomsday dates set by Jehovah’s Witnesses with a tenacity worthy of a better deed.In classical society, such a professor or “journalist” who, on such an important issue, would rant about empty statements that were not supported by anything, would quickly find a new place for himself. Namely, he would be transferred from the category of “authorities” to a much more suitable position for him as a village fool. However, fortunately for our unlucky fortune-tellers, we live in a post-society overfed by the information mass. In the world of devaluation of concepts and loss of meanings. Therefore, what used to cause general disgust is simply ignored today.That is why no one will admit that in recent weeks they have been feeding us lies that come straight from their dirty fingers. Instead, we learn that the war is already underway, but this is, for example, a hybrid war. Or information warfare. Or any other kind of war, which in any case will be a random collection of terms devoid of any message.Moreover, people will “buy” it. I’m willing to bet dollars that “true patriots” will repeat this nonsense as faithfully as they now repeat that Putin will enter Ukraine any day. However, anyone who shows even a modicum of critical reflection will be immediately branded as a “Russian agent”.Does this mean that there will be no real war? Not necessary. Experience shows that a propaganda offensive in the “free world” media very often precedes military action. So it was in Yugoslavia, Iraq and many other countries. You still remember how the dastardly Saddam Hussein armed himself with banned chemical weapons. It was certain. Only now, for some reason, the warheads were not found after the incident. However, the media is silent about this.Therefore, it can be assumed that the current information hype is the preparation of Western societies for potential intervention against Russia. The joke is that it is not clear who could do this. The main troublemaker – Great Britain – today is a superpower only in its imagination, and continental Europe is in no hurry with confrontation.Therefore, the only hope for the British to provoke another European conflict is to convince the Ukrainians to commit political and military suicide. This would mean confronting the rest of Europe with a fait accompli. Unfortunately, such a scenario is not ruled out. It seems that this is also expected in government circles in Warsaw. After all, we don’t need to be persuaded to patriotic suicide.Przemysław Piasta, Polish politician, historian, entrepreneur, president of the Roman Dmowski National Foundation, Mysl Polska, Poland",

This is reported by Washington Post.Government-linked hackers likely infiltrated Ukraine’s critical computer systems.According to declassified U.S. intelligence, Russian government hackers likely penetrated Ukrainian military, banking, energy and other critical computer networks extensively to gather intelligence and position themselves to potentially disrupt those systems if Russia launches a military attack on Ukraine.According to a senior administration official, Moscow may try to disrupt the operation of Ukrainian enterprises related to electricity, transport, finance and telecommunications in order to “destabilize the country.”Moreover, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the United States will not put pressure on Kiev to join NATO.",

      "content": "Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova asked American and British “mass disinformation media” on her Telegram channel for a schedule of Russia’s “invasions” into Ukraine in order to plan a vacation.“A request to the US and British disinformation media Bloomberg, The New York Times, The Sun, etc. – announce the schedule of our “invasions” for the coming year. I would like to plan a vacation,” she wrote.Earlier, the British tabloids Sun and Mirror wrote that, despite the statements of the Russian Ministry of Defense about the withdrawal of troops after the exercises, the “invasion of Ukraine” was allegedly scheduled for 4.00 Moscow time on Wednesday. The Sun tabloid claimed that this was the “most likely” time and that Russia was preparing to launch a massive strike with 200,000 troops, tanks, aircraft, missiles and ships. On Wednesday morning, the Sun edited its article on the site, the authors replaced the exact time of the “invasion of Ukraine” with the fact that it could begin “at any time.”The US Bloomberg agency, which had previously mistakenly reported an “invasion” of Ukraine that had begun, wrote, citing officials, that Russia could “attack” the neighboring country on February 15. At the same time, the agency did not specify the officials from which countries they are talking about, does not name their positions and names, and also does not provide any evidence. Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov, commenting on the erroneous publication of Bloomberg by RIA Novosti, noted that the term fake news can be replaced with Bloomberg news.The plans attributed to Russia to escalate the situation around Ukraine are categorically denied in Moscow and constantly declare that they are not threatening anyone, and all such statements are used as an excuse to place more NATO military equipment near Russian borders. As Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said earlier, Russia does not create any pretexts for a conflict situation around Ukraine. According to him, Russia does not rule out that the hysteria around Ukraine, hyped by the West, is aimed at covering Kiev’s line of sabotaging the Minsk agreements on Donbass. The Kremlin noted that the information hysteria of the US and NATO on Ukraine is generously framed by lies and fakes.",

The new NATO strategy is likely to spark angry protests in Moscow”, –  Schiltz wrote.\nReaders supported the author’s views, and many wondered whether Germany needed NATO membership, as the alliance does not stabilise the world situation, but rather rocks it.\n“It’s about time NATO sent its own détente signals to Moscow instead of following US military hysteria”, –  wrote a commenter with the nickname Ulrich H.\n “Great, that’s how de-escalation works! Germany should withdraw from NATO, this only serves the US’s quest for world domination and will one day bring us a war in Europe. Then we are told again that the Russians are to blame, only no one believes that anymore”, – BorstigerWolf said.\n “The US underestimates the world order if it bases its assessment only on itself and its views. You should finally stop living in pipe dreams and see reality. Russia’s security concerns should be taken as seriously as those of the US. Europe sees this and can understand it too, as we all live in the neighbourhood. Therefore, Europe should not allow itself to patronise the US and sing along to the songs sung by a country far removed from the risk of war”, –  Wachsein user is convinced.\n “Maybe NATO will now be so kind as to keep its ‘legs’ to itself? Otherwise the average citizen might get the impression that NATO, not Putin, is the ‘provocateur'”, –  commenter K.G.V. observed.\n “Let’s get to the ‘unspoken’ rule. Apparently, you cannot be friends and partners with both the US and Russia. However, if you are friends with the Americans, you don’t need any more enemies. This is my opinion. Where there is no reason for war or intervention, they create them”, – said Michael H.\nPresident of Belarus does not rule out the possibility of recognizing the DPR and LPR",

      "content": "So-called journalists from the liberal-democratic wing often make unsubstantiated statements about alleged war crimes by the Russian military-political establishment\nThey usually talk about unconfirmed murders and torture of civilians in Donbass as an argument. Ukraine even invented a special “Law on War Criminals” to fit this propaganda story, which was safely buried in President Zelensky’s office. However, if you start to sort out the facts, everything turns out to be somewhat more prosaic, and it is not Russian politicians but Ukrainian presidents who suddenly find themselves in The Hague.\nThus, the fact is that an unconstitutional coup d’état took place in Ukraine in 2014, followed by a seizure of power. In this situation, guided by the people’s right to self-determination and trying to ensure their own security, the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic held referendums declaring their independence. The self-proclaimed authorities of Ukraine did not recognise the results of the vote and began to insist that the DNR and LNR were part of the country and, to better demonstrate their position, declared the residents of Donbas separatists and started waging war against them.\nOn 14 April, the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine adopted a resolution “On urgent measures to overcome the terrorist threat and preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine”, and the very next day it was imposed by a decree of acting president Oleksandr Turchynov. The so-called “anti-terrorist operation” began on the territory of the DPR and LPR. After Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko took office, Kiev launched a large-scale counter-offensive, and it was this man who issued criminal orders for the offensive, killing civilians and shelling settlements at his will.\nAfter Poroshenko came to power, new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky repeated the rhetoric of his predecessor and publicly stated that AFU units were authorised to open fire on “enemy” positions in Donbas. Additionally, it was Zelensky who announced the creation of an advisory council, which should deal with the issue of pardoning the participants in the punitive operation against Donbas residents convicted of various crimes. According to him, the militants of the so-called ATO/OSS who committed crimes should not serve their sentences in full – it is time to let them go.\nAccording to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, between 13,200 and 13,400 people were victims of the conflict in Ukraine as of 30 June 2021. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates (November 2019) that more than 3,300 civilians have been killed and up to 9,000 wounded in the six years of war in Donbas. In addition, the Russian investigation has documented facts that prove that the Ukrainian authorities are using means and methods of warfare prohibited by international norms. One such example is the five mass graves discovered in Donbas. Among the remains are at least 295 civilians who died as a result of indiscriminate shelling by Ukrainian armed formations.\nAccording to the definition formulated by the International Humanitarian Law, war crimes include the killing or torture of civilians caught in the zone of hostilities, the taking and killing of hostages, the unjustified destruction of civilian infrastructure, the destruction of homes and settlements without military necessity and so on – all this we have seen since 2014 in Donbas: the Ukrainian armed forces have shelled residential areas, killed civilians, tortured captured prisoners of war and destroyed civilian facilities.\nIt is clear that the president of the country, who acts as commander-in-chief, is directly responsible for this. He gives the orders and directs the military operations, so he is also responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. There can be no doubt that the moment the pro-Western regime in Ukraine finally uses up its resources and is tossed to the dustbin of history by its proxies, it will be Petro Poroshenko and Vladimir Zelensky who will be responsible for all the atrocities committed by the AFU in Donbass. Fortunately, they will not be able to avoid a fair trial because such crimes have no statute of limitations and no amnesties.\nIgor Mukhin, specially for News Front",

      "content": "The situation in the DPR has changed dramatically after the announcement of the Head of the DPR Denis Pushilin about the mass evacuation of the civilian populationAccording to the text, an operational headquarters was created in the Rostov region, where refugees from the DPR will be accommodated. According to the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the DPR, it is planned to take out about 700 thousand residents of the Republic.Immediately after the message and the video with the announcement were published, the DPR Ministry of Emergency Situations turned on the sirens. This is what provoked queues at gas stations and ATMs. In addition, a line of people formed in supermarkets who bought essential products. Residents of the Republic rushed to refuel their vehicles, although the DPR authorities provide buses for those who want to leave the territory. The first to be taken out were children from boarding school No. 1.At the same time there was an interruption in telephone communication. The republican cellular operator “Phoenix” did not differ in stable work anyway, but in such circumstances it began to fail altogether. But SMS alerts still came by the Phoenix user. In particular, the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the DPR urged to follow the instructions posted on the television and radio network, SMS informing from Phoenix, as well as received from the relevant specialized services of the city (district). In addition, checkpoints were indicated through which residents of the DPR can leave the territory of the Republic.Particular attention was drawn to the message from “PS FSB ru”. It said that “The passage of persons across the border was allowed only with passports of citizens of the Russian Federation.” According to a correspondent of the Donbass Decides Telegram channel, men under the age of 55 are not allowed to leave at the border. This is not surprising, since Pushilin’s appeal said that women, children and the elderly would be the first to be taken out. According to my information, buses with refugees will pass the border in a simplified form along the “green corridor”.Against the background of these events, an explosion occurred in the parking lot in front of the building of the Government of the DPR, the former Regional State Administration. As it turned out, the car of Denis Sinenkov, Head of the People’s Police Department of the DPR, was blown up. Sinenkov himself was not injured.After 8 pm, I drove to several addresses that were listed on the evacuation list. In the Voroshilovsky, Kievsky and Leninsky districts, as of the evening of February 18, there were no buses in place. Only in front of the building of the Palace of Culture of the XXI Congress of the CPSU were two empty buses. There were no people willing to leave, no organizers of the evacuation. However, the official representative of the People’s Police of the DPR, Eduard Basurin, said that the evacuation would take place even at night.Despite the above information, according to personal feelings, there is no panic in Donetsk. Yes, most of the streets are empty, but this is normal for a city that has been living under war conditions for almost 8 years. Most of the vehicles are queuing at gas stations. Even empty gas stations came across, but most likely this is due to the fact that they ran out of fuel.But there are no pogroms, as is usually the case during riots, when people take advantage of the situation for personal enrichment. In stores, at ATMs and at gas stations, people calmly stand in lines without brawls. I admit that there could be individual incidents, but they are not massive. According to polls in Telegram channels, the majority do not plan to leave the DPR. Although on the street I met young couples who were walking along Donetsk with suitcases.Denis Grigoryuk, Analytical Service of Donbass",

The decision on recognition was made taking into account the free will of the inhabitants of Donbass, on the basis of the provisions of the UN Charter, the 1970 Declaration on the Principles of International Law, the Final Act of the CSCE, and other fundamental international documents;7.

      "content": "With the recognition of the sovereignty of the two republics of the Donbass, the Kremlin, in addition to demonstrating its commitment to defending Russian minorities and giving a concrete response to the State Duma, has achieved some objectives, including:a) demonstration to the West that the Russian Federation is ready for anything in order to secure its borders;b) demonstration that it is its intention to create, in particular, a safety belt to the West;c) providing release of the diplomatic stalemate;d) opening of a new negotiation season on the basis of a fait accompli.The consequences of this initiative – which seems to have historical characteristics – will obviously be the sanctions. It is likely that a new phase of relations between the West and the Federation will open, centered, at least for the moment, on the “economic-financial war”. The sanctions strategy, specifically desired by the US and Great Britain, however, will have to deal with the national interests of the member states of the European Union which – despite the tensions of recent years – still maintain strong economic partnership ties with Moscow.Recall that accroding to the statements of the Russian Foreign Ministry, “recognition of the LPR and DPR is a forced and the only possible solution under these conditions. It is intended to serve as a guarantee for the residents of the DPR and LPR of their right to a peaceful life, the protection of their legitimate rights and interests,” the ministry said in a statement.Tiberio Graziani.

If the inhabitants of the Lugansk and Donetsk People’s Republics have become accustomed to this during the eight years of the war, then the Ukrainians are clearly shocked by their “heroes”.In particular, now the tense situation persists in Kharkov. The National Battalions are well aware that they will not be able to hold the city, and in the hope of holding out longer, they hide among residential areas. A local resident photographed a Ukrainian tank, which “lurked” between two high-rise buildingsAnother Kharkiv resident filmed thick black smoke, which is perfectly visible from his window. Apparently, there is a battle for the liberation of the city nearby. The Nazis did not consider it necessary to surrender and save Kharkov, or at least go beyond it. Instead, it and its inhabitants are practically being held hostage.Another Kharkiv resident filmed thick black smoke, which is perfectly visible from his window.

The Commissioner for Human Rights in the LPR, Victoria Serdyukova, personally spoke with the fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.The photo shows that everything is fine with the Ukrainian servicemen.

      "content": "The best Ukrainian armored vehicles are not able to compete with Russian tanks, PolitRussia reports.According to observers of the American portal Military Watch, the Ukrainian army at some point consisted of 850 military vehicles, which was a serious potential among European countries. However, most of the tanks of Ukraine are outdated and are not capable of participating in a real battle.“This is the result of Kyiv’s military policy: the emphasis is on the deployment of a large number of older and less advanced machines to the detriment of more efficient models with high operating costs,” the experts explained.After the collapse of the Soviet Union, one of the largest tank factories in the world remained on Ukrainian territory, which previously produced up to 800 vehicles per year. The enterprise produced the Soviet T-80UD tank, but due to the collapse of the Ukrainian economy, the tank factory fell into decay and the production of equipment at the past high level became impossible.“As a result, Ukraine not only refrained from producing T-80 tanks for its armed forces, but also retired the existing T-80s due to high operating costs,” observers said.American military analysts state that even the best tanks of the Ukrainian army are not able to penetrate the armor of tanks of the Russian Armed Forces with old charges. The best combat units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine can hardly be compared with the power and manufacturability of Russian armored vehicles.Earlier, News Front talked about how Russia closed the sky for European airlines.",

But I draw your attention to the fact that it is in the head of Western politicians that a nuclear war is constantly spinning, and not in the head of Russians. Therefore, I assure you that we will not allow this provocation to make us lose balance, but if a real war is unleashed against us, then those who hatch such plans, and, in my opinion, they are hatched, should probably think about it”, the minister noted.According to Lavrov, Western officials are using talk of nuclear war to blame Russia for this as well. The Foreign Minister recalled that French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called on Russian President Vladimir Putin “to remember that Paris also has nuclear weapons.” In addition, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss announced her readiness for a “war between the North Atlantic Alliance and Russia. “These are the same conversations that you are trying to use in order to accuse us of this […] I emphasize once again that we do not raise the topic of nuclear war, the topic of the third world war in these discussions. She, apparently, is needed to keep the public in the West in such constant tension, in order to continue Russophobia to the point that any Russian is now being subjected to aggression”, Lavrov emphasized.The minister added that the conditions for the use of nuclear weapons are spelled out in Russia’s military doctrine and there is “no escalation for the sake of de-escalation, which Western analysts are talking about.” I ask you to look very carefully at the statements that were made and at the characters who make these statements, the Russian Foreign Minister concluded.",

      "content": "In the last couple of weeks, mention of Ukraine has practically disappeared from the front pages of most Western publications. No, the Ukrainian events themselves are still one of the main topics there, but it is no longer being peddled as it was at the beginning of the war or even a couple of months ago. And I think there are two main reasonsFirstly, the United States achieved its goal, for which, starting from October last year, it unleashed militaristic hysteria in the media – they provoked a Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict. And therefore, there is no longer a special need to exaggerate further. And secondly, what the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the National Battalions are doing in this war is becoming more and more difficult to hide and hush up.The news coming from Ukraine significantly affects the rhetoric of Western politicians, it is increasingly difficult for them to say that Zelensky and Co. are fighting for the “ideals of Western democracy”, while presenting themselves as an openly Nazi regime.Over the past day and the day before yesterday, several American media outlets (and we are not talking about some minor publications, but about such “monsters” as CNN and the Washington Post) published materials that admit that the Azov Regiment is a neo-Nazi unit, but Ukrainian servicemen commit war crimes on a massive scale, mocking prisoners and hiding behind the civilian population, as a “human shield”. Moreover, there are even phrases that Putin’s statements about denazification as one of the main tasks of the special military operation have good grounds.Well, the fact that the West “suddenly” discovered Nazis in Ukraine, who supposedly are not there and never were, is not the biggest news.The same “Azov”* has already been recognized in the United States as an extremist paramilitary formation and crossed out from the lists of military assistance for Ukraine. Why the Americans suddenly needed such scrupulousness is not entirely clear, especially since everything they need: weapons, ammunition, uniforms, and even the help and participation of military instructors from the United States and Canada, the Azov people received in full. But, apparently, there were some internal reasons for this.Nevertheless, no sanctions were imposed on Kyiv for the presence of outright Nazis in the ranks of the Ukrainian law enforcement agencies. The very case when “our son of a bitch” is not so “bitch”.But now, when the entire propaganda machine of the most “free and liberal” Western press is set up solely to expose Putin, Russia, Russians, in general, everything Russian or in any way connected with us, as international criminals on the basis of “blood and soil ”(big hello to the ideologues of the Third Reich), the behavior of their Ukrainian wards, bordering (and sometimes far beyond) the animal, prevents them from doing this thankless task.So, on March 29, an article appeared on the CNN website, the title of which read: “The far-right battalion plays a key role in the Ukrainian resistance. Their neo-Nazi leanings strengthen Putin’s position.” What a grief! Just think, the problem is not that in the 21st century, in a country in the center of Europe, the Fuhrer’s admirers are in power, studying “Mein Kampf” in the evenings, not in the crimes that they commit, not in the fact that all this happens not only from a silent consent, but also with the active support of Western states, and that, you see, Putin will be right!The Washington Post recently spoke in the same vein. The newspaper published an article entitled Russia has killed civilians in Ukraine. Kyiv’s defense tactics add to the danger, which can be translated as “Russia is killing civilians in Ukraine. Kyiv’s defensive tactics exacerbate the danger.” The article, I must say, is quite impressive, accompanied by a large number of photographic materials and quotes from various experts.At the same time, no matter how hard the authors tried to shift all the blame for what is happening in Ukraine to Russia (they even specifically focused attention on this several times in the text so that no one would have any doubts about their loyalty and the “correct” point of view), most of the material turned out to be devoted to the facts and evidence of war crimes of the Kiev regime. Moreover, crimes against their own population.Thus, according to American journalists, Ukrainians are increasingly confronted with an unpleasant truth: practically every district in most cities has become a military objective, which makes them potential, and most importantly, “legitimate” targets for Russian troops. Here are excerpts from the comments of two Western experts who agreed to discuss the situation in Ukraine with WP journalists.William Shabas, professor of international law at Middlesex University in London:“I am very reluctant to admit that Ukraine is responsible for civilian casualties as it resists Russian aggression. But to the extent that Ukraine moves the battlefield to civilian areas, this increases the danger to the civilian population.”“Ukraine cannot use civilian quarters as a “human shield,” Shabas added, saying that he could not imagine that something like this was actually happening.Richard Weir, Crisis and Conflict Researcher at Human Rights Watch, now based in Ukraine:“If there is military equipment there, and the Russians say that we are shooting at this military equipment, this undermines the claim that they are deliberately attacking civilian objects and civilians. The Ukrainian military is responsible under international law for the withdrawal of its forces and equipment from areas inhabited by civilians and, if this is not possible, for the movement of civilians from these areas. If they don’t, it will be a violation of the laws of war… What they are doing is putting the civilian population at risk. Because all their military equipment is a legitimate target. If there are military targets in the area, then it could undermine their (Ukrainian) claim that a particular strike was a war crime.”As the representatives of the American newspaper emphasize, over the past month they have repeatedly witnessed how Ukrainian anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft guns and armored personnel carriers were located near residential buildings.“In one wasteland, Washington Post reporters noticed a truck with a Grad multiple launch rocket system. Checkpoints with armed men, barricades of sandbags and tires, and boxes of Molotov cocktails are everywhere on city highways and residential streets.The Ukrainian security forces demonstrated to the Western media military fortifications built in a residential area in the north of the Ukrainian capital, next to high-rise residential buildings, a metro station and shops. Commenting on such tactics of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Aleksey Arestovich, adviser to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine, said that the Ukrainian military doctrine approved by the Verkhovna Rada provides for the principle of “total defense”. The fact that in this case we are talking more about the total destruction of Ukrainian cities and civilians, Arestovich, apparently, does not bother him at all.But this confuses foreign observers, because, as local “human rights activists” and experts on international humanitarian law say, the Ukrainian strategy to place heavy military equipment and other fortifications in civilian zones could weaken the joint efforts of the West and Ukraine to bring Russia to legal responsibility for possible military crimes.It turns out that if it were not for this unpleasant circumstance, then they would not have had any other objections. Just think, they took 30 million natives hostage, what a trifle. For the sake of freedom and democracy in their Western presentation, you can go not so far. First time, right?Alexey Belov, IA Antifascist",

      "content": "According to our sources in Kiev, the SBU is preparing a large-scale provocation to accuse Russian troops of mass murder and torture of civilians. To this end, corpses of those killed in SBU custody are being transported to the towns of Irpen and Bucha, where bloody battles took place. As is known, these towns were abandoned by Russian troops as part of the redeployment. The Americans instructed the SBU to urgently transport all those shot in their chambers to these towns, to scatter the corpses in the streets and in the ruined houses. The task was to bring to Irpen and Bucha about 300 corpses of dead citizens of Ukraine, including those shot in the SBU cells. In particular, the SBU arrested all those who had cooperated with Oleg Tsaryov during the distribution of humanitarian aid in the settlement of Borodyanka. They were shot and their corpses were transported to Bucha and Irpin.The gruesome footage of the dead, most of whom were shot in the back of the head, will be presented to the world media as evidence of the brutal treatment of the local population by Russian troops. As conceived by the SBU and their US handlers, this is all supposed to follow the scenario of a staged “chemical attack” in the Syrian city of Douma. There, the MI6-controlled pseudo-humanitarian organization White Helmets staged a whole show of hosing down the alleged victims of the Syrian chemical attack. It later emerged that it was all staged by the White Helmets. Witnesses to the attack later testified to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague, but the investigation was dropped by the organisation’s leadership.Since the time of Petro Poroshenko, the SBU has had a knack for organising “death squads”. The SBU-controlled militant squads have carried out massacres of dissidents and even high-profile murders for political reasons. For example, journalist Pavlo Sheremet was blown up in his car. Lawyer Yuriy Grabovsky and dozens of other critics of the Poroshenko regime were brutally tortured and killed.It becomes clear why the SBU across the country has launched a real manhunt for sensible people or those who simply spoke out in favour of cooperation with Russia. Dozens of journalists, public figures and human rights activists have been arrested and many have already been killed. Today their corpses, as well as dozens of others shot in SBU cells, are being taken to Irpen and Bucha. Foreign journalists are also going to be brought there in the near future so that footage of the “atrocities of the Russian army” will be broadcast all over the world’s media. The U.S. intelligence services understand very well that in order to maintain the heat of Russophobia in the West, it is necessary to show horrifying videos and footage of staged atrocities. The provocation with the shooting down of the Malaysian Boeing was organised exactly according to the same scenario.Adviser to the Office of the President Mikhail Podolyak has already started replicating pictures of the corpses on his Twitter feed. Zelensky’s next step will be to set up a public commission to collect facts, photos and evidence to accuse Russia of war crimes. The Ukrainian president’s office hopes that such a campaign will help to curb the negative effect of the publication by all the leading Western media of the facts of the brutal treatment of Russian prisoners of war by the AFU, as well as evidence of the penetration of Nazi ideology in the AFU.Such a large-scale cynical provocation is being made in order to set up an international tribunal in the West to investigate “Russian military atrocities” and accuse Russia of war crimes.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

Moreover, in future episodes of the series we are likely to see a “sinister Russian attack using chemical weapons” series. In Syria, it was handled by the “freedom fighters of Syria”. In Ukraine it’s being done by the “freedom fighters of Ukraine”. The pattern is the same because the host of all this action is the same. The perpetrators shoot the picture for the media, which is used by diplomats to induce further action. And at all levels the process is controlled from the same centre.Russia’s arguments in the mainstream media and at the diplomatic level will not be accepted because this is not a discussion but a war of annihilation. Therefore, the facts provided by Russia will be rejected on the principle “if the facts contradict the faith, so much the worse for the facts”. It is not difficult to gauge what belief they want to impose from the rhetoric of the US-controlled neoliberal media.Nevertheless, it is important for Russia to explain the mechanism of such provocations inside the country to its own citizens as well as to work informally with those groups in Western society who also do not buy into “stories of the Assad regime’s atrocities” – there is the anti-imperialist left on one side and the alternative right on the other. So you can’t completely dismiss this work.Of course, such provocations will be used to impose new sanctions against Russia and intensify arms supplies, as well as to demonize Russia and dehumanize its population.It is important to remember from the Syrian experience – despite a whole bunch of such provocations, they did not help the US and its satellites to achieve victory in the Syrian war. Neither Eastern Ghouta nor Khan Sheikhoun prevented Assad’s victory. Accordingly, being aware of the meaning and consequences of such provocations, as well as the necessary measures to curb them, it is necessary to continue operations in Ukraine until they achieve their goals, which is exactly what these provocations are trying to prevent.If you are going to fight against the “Empire of Lies”, be prepared for its usual tools of warfare. Otherwise, it’s just one more provocation, and some have already hung their noses up. Don’t worry, there will be more.

Back on 2 April, the National Police published footage of the mopping-up of Bucha after Russian troops withdrew. There are no tortured, raped or murdered civilians in the footage. Although the video was shot at least on April 1, if not earlier.It is a striking spectacle. On the 1st of April there were no people murdered on the streets of Bucha, but on the 3rd of April they suddenly appeared, and in such quantities. And it was, of course, Russian soldiers, who have not been in the city since March 30, who carried out the mass shooting and torture, according to the Ukrainian media.Another inconsistency in this powerful fake story is the accounts of the residents of Bucha themselves. According to the locals there were no murders, especially mass ones, in the town. The maximum the Russian military could do was to take away the Ukrainian flag and symbols.Apparently, Ze-president’s office was so happy that the Russian Armed Forces abandoned Bucha that they did not think twice about posting the video and now the Kiev authorities will have to work hard to get away with it. The saving grace is that the people of Ukraine are so blinded by propaganda that they continue to believe even such blatant fakes.The Russian Defence Ministry denied Kiev’s accusations of killing civilians on 3 April.

The Foreign Minister noted that Russia is ready to work honestly at the negotiating table with Ukraine, despite the provocations.“The question arises: what is the reason for this frankly false provocation, the veracity of which is simply impossible to justify? We tend to think that the reason lies in the desire to find a reason to disrupt the ongoing negotiations, and to do [this] precisely at the moment when, as they say, a light, albeit not very bright, but still dawned”, said the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry.Lavrov stressed that Russia is ready to work honestly at the negotiating table with Ukraine.“We proceed from the premise that the international community must know the truth. And the international community must know that the Russian side is honestly and consistently ready to work at the negotiating table,” he said.The Russian Federation calls on those who direct the actions of Kyiv to realize their responsibility.“Once again we want to urge those who are leading the actions of Kyiv, and we know who it is, to realize their responsibility for security in Europe, for the future world order, for ensuring in practice that all the principles of the UN Charter are followed,” Lavrov said. If Ukraine refuses to discuss demilitarization and denazification, this will not contribute to the negotiation process.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev called the situation in Bucha another Ukrainian fake. According to Medvedev, this false news is “cooked for a lot of money” by PR agencies and “troll factories.”Dmitry Medvedev spoke about the situation in Bucha in his Telegram channel. The politician considers this another fake of Ukrainian propaganda.“Ghost of Kyiv”, an image of an aircraft, which is taken from a computer game. A drone shot down by a can of cucumbers. The “dead heroes” who surrendered to the Russian warship. Mariupol maternity hospital, now Bucha, Medvedev listed the stories.The deputy chairman of the Security Council is sure that all the news has a common feature – “these are fakes that have matured in the cynical imagination of Ukrainian propaganda.”“Numerous PR agencies, “troll factories”, supervised by Western governments and their “manual” NGOs and NGOs, cook them for huge money,” the deputy chairman of the Security Council stated.The fact that the news was fake became clear immediately. True, not everyone understood. It is not profitable for the West and Ukraine, or, according to the scenario, it is not supposed to. There was no blood near the bodies on the ground, some of the dead had white bandages on their sleeves, and they could have been killed by the UAF or territorial defense fighters. Moreover, in the video recordings, the “corpses” move their arms and change position. But what is striking is that Ukrainians and the West believed this blatant lie.The accusations of Kyiv in the murder of civilians were denied by the Russian Defense Ministry on April 3. According to the Ministry of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, they completely left Bucha on March 30, and “evidence of crimes” appeared only on the fourth day, when SBU officers arrived in the city.In addition, on March 31, the mayor of the city, Anatoly Fedoruk, recorded a video message in which he confirmed that Russian troops had left Bucha. But there was no talk of any mass casualties, Fedoruk also for some reason did not say about rape, torture and looting.“Day by day, the news about “horror stories” and “overcomes” is becoming more and more delusional. However, the Kyiv fake car stops at nothing!” Medvedev wrote. “This is because deep Ukrainianism, fueled by anti-Russian poison and an all-consuming lie about its identity, is one big fake,” the politician is sure. Medvedev noted: “This phenomenon has never happened in history, and does not exist now.”On February 24, Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin made this decision after the escalation of the conflict in the Donbass and requests for help from the Heads of the LDNR. In his statement, the Russian leader stressed that the NVO is aimed at the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

They were tortured and shot, allegedly by the Russian military.

      "content": "According to Russian political experts, the situation around the provocations from the Ukrainian side in Bucha is a direct proof that the Kiev regime is ready to implement the so-called “Yugoslav scenario” in Ukraine, which will inevitably lead to the complete destruction of the country.According to experts of the Russian analytical publication Vzglyad, we are now very likely to have real facts in front of us rather than idle speculation. According to the mechanism worked out during the Yugoslav conflict, the justification for the intervention of NATO forces is the so-called casus belli regime of large-scale killings, primarily of civilians.Illustrative is the precedent set in Bosnia in 1994, which led to the bombing of a Muslim market in the occupied part of Sarajevo. The perpetrators have still not been identified, but it is clear that they must be held accountable. The key point is that this is what enabled NATO military formations to intervene in the conflict, not immediately after the events but a year and a half later, after the genocide of civilians in Srebrenica had begun.The peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, with the help of Russian forces, is designed to protect the operation from the introduction of NATO forces, due to Russia’s nuclear advantage. Yet official Kiev has not given up trying to manipulate the threat of World War III by insistently calling on the Alliance to join in “protecting” Ukraine from Russian army forces.According to experts, the Kiev authorities have long ceased to be afraid of anything, desperately provoking the international community to escalate not a national but a global conflict. At the same time, even Western countries are beginning to recognise that the Ukrainian propaganda machine is a powerful psychological weapon that has nothing to do with reality. In this connection, the fakes in Bucha may well be a valid reason for the Kiev authorities to implement the “Yugoslav scenario” in Ukraine.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "Another burning issue of the Ukrainian regime’s atrocities has become the “Tochka-U” missile attack at the railway station in Kramatrosk, DPR region. Provocation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the death of civilians and the Tochka-U missile are another example of bloody Ukrainian schemes.The footage from Kramatorsk makes it possible to determine by the shape of the missile’s control rudders, that it was a Tochka-U complex, which is not in service with the Russian Federation Armed Forces since at least 2019. Instead, it has been actively used by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Judging by the location of the wreckage of the “Tochka-U”, the shelling was conducted from the south-west side, from the territory controlled by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Rybar Telegram channel writes.It is of high probability that Ukrainian authorities decided to repeat the incident in Bucha, only on the territory of the Donetsk region.This is not the first strike against civilians with the help of “Tochka U”. Previously the Armed Forces of Ukraine used it against the city center of Donetsk. But of course, the Ukrainian media publish that it was a Russian Iskander missile that hit the Kramatorsk railway station. Why was the railway station of the city chosen? “The human shield” mechanism is being implemented. In order to disrupt the evacuation of the city and use civilians as human shields, the Ukrainian regime sacrificed the lives of civilians. The military tactics of Ukraine now comes down to hiding equipment and manpower in residential areas, any other scenario is the defeat of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the shortest possible time.We remind that “Tochka-U” is not in service with either the DPR or the Russian army. “Therefore, it is obvious that this is a provocation  similar to what happened in Bucha and it has specific political goals”, Vladislav Berdichevsky, deputy of the DPR parliament, told the reporters. “Obviously, the “Tochka-U” attack on Kramatorsk was arranged for today’s arrival to Kyiv of Ursula von der Leyen – Head of the European Commission, and the head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell. They use this as a background for negotiations and putting forward their demands on sanctions and arms supplies,” the MP said.“This is a classic scheme of Zelensky’s media machine,” Berdichevsky explained.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

Ukraine immediately stated that it was Russia that fired at people who were in a hurry to evacuate from Kramatorsk and that it was an Iskander with a cluster warhead.3. When photos of the rocket fragments appeared, it turned out that it was Tochka-U, which is used by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. After that, Zelensky changed his mind and began to assert that this was not an Iskander, as Arestovich and Kirilenko broadcast, but Tochka-U, only the Russian one. But statements about the Iskander are nowhere to be seen, and now it looks like an attempt to hastily shift responsibility from the Armed Forces of Ukraine to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.4. In the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, “Tochka-U” missile was officially withdrawn from service with missile brigades in connection with the transition to the “Iskander”. There is not a single video showing the combat use of Tochka-U by the Russian Federation Armed Forces or the DPR/LPR Armies in the Donbass (even if we assume that they will be taken from long-term storage bases). At the same time, there are a lot of videos of the combat use of the Iskander and other types of missiles. And these are always precise applications. At the same time, Ukraine uses Tochka-U everywhere, including to strike at the city center of Donetsk, where the Security Service of Ukraine gathered a rally specifically for this strike through front men in social networks.5. The missile, presumably, flew in from the southwestern direction, from the territory controlled by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The data is different, some sources say the missile was hit, others say it worked well. The missile had an inscription “For the children” on its tail part.6. It is also worth noting that the population of Donbass, including Slavyansk and Kramatorsk, is considered by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to be disloyal (in Ukraine, residents of Donbass are actually deprived of voting rights), so they can easily be sacrificed.7. Is it an accident or intentional killing of civilians? Based on the practice of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Donbass, I would bet that this is a deliberate and thoroughly planned murder of their own citizens, who were soon to become citizens of the DPR, in order to continue the track of bloody provocations.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "The French expert community admitted that the Tochka-U attack on Kramatorsk was a provocation by the Kiev regime.This was stated by a political scientist, president of the Institute of the History of Franco-Russian Relations Emmanuel Leroy in an interview with Izvestia. He noted that the tragedy was a manipulation that the Ukrainian authorities were trying to pull off.“As for Kramatorsk, this is another disgusting manipulation by Kyiv, the Ukrainian authorities, as well as their Anglo-Saxon supporters who are behind Ukraine. Obviously, having lost the battles, they are trying to win the information war,” he said.One of the proofs of his words, he called the fact that nationalist associations are led by people from Western Ukraine. They hate Donbass and its inhabitants, so such a cruel blow to people is a common thing for them.In addition, Leroy’s version is also supported by the fact that Tochka-U collapsed at the “opportune” moment. There were a lot of people at the station, who were methodically driven there in recent days, calling for evacuation from the city. The Nazis committed a crime with a huge number of victims and blamed Russia for it.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "A resident of Bucha, whose name we do not mention for obvious reasons, asked to publish his cry of heart wherever possible, so that people would know the truth about the bloody events in the city and its surroundings“Good afternoon. I am a citizen of Ukraine. I am currently in Kiev. Please publish my letter. We evacuated from Bucha on March 12. Our large apartment building (250 flats) has been completely looted. The Ukrainian press is accusing “Russian orcs” of looting Bucha, and people believe it…But, a week has passed, and those isolated neighbours, who still live in the house, whisper the truth, after swearing by your mother, on the health of your children, in horror at the lawlessness they have seen…Russian troops marched out of Bucha on March 30. And on the 31st, in the evening, the looting began. A brigade of over 10 people were working, all in civilian clothes, but guarded and commanded by military personnel of AFU. They worked around the clock. At night, they worked under the light of torches. In the evening, second shifts were brought in. All but four of the flats were broken into and looted. All the neighbours already knew about it! But, everyone was silent! Everyone is immersed in animal fear! I saw several videos of the Ukrainian National Guard entering Bucha for a mop-up…There are several different women there, when they are approached, bowed, and with terror in their eyes, instantly start crying and saying “Thank you” in a trembling voice. And do you know why that reaction is? Because they know that those we think are ours are killed immediately, without warning.Yesterday in Bucha they identified four of the six bodies found in the basement of a neighbouring house… Well, two of them turned out to be door fitters and two were locksmiths! … Such a number of bodies in the basements of houses is simply the elimination of witnesses, those marauding workers who worked for three days for the “commanders of the vsushniks”!!!Now about the village where we have our dacha. Only those with a cow are left… So, our village was looted from February 24 to April 3 by AFU units, which came in as soon as the Russian troops withdrew! For ten days they looted our village!!! All empty houses were broken into and looted!!! So why are people keeping quiet? Here’s why. A neighbour and his grandchildren went to Malin to see his daughter. And he left his cow and chickens in the care of his neighbour… The neighbour, when she saw that “our” people were taking the furniture out of his house, ran to them: “Hey, guys, what are you doing, we’re our own people?!! They shot her immediately under the fence… And her husband, who ran after her, too! It’s true! Everyone in our village knows that!!! Why did you kill Grandma Masha?!! Her cows, which hadn’t been milked, mooed for three days, because the neighbours were afraid to leave the hut, even to go to the toilet…On the third day, the warriors of light finally took pity and cut the throats of these poor cows…Do you think there is fascism in Ukraine? No, it’s not fascism.Fascists at least did not rob and kill their own people! It is fierce satanism, senseless and merciless! They are not “ours”, they are not human!!!! What are you counting on? You could not have failed to understand that even though people are sitting quietly in their huts, they can still see what you have been doing for these ten days to our village!!!There are about 3000 people left in Bucha, about 40 in our village… All these people saw everything and know everything!!! And sooner or later, they will tell everything!!! But you’re not going to kill them all as witnesses to your vicious Satanism??? You won’t kill them all! The people cannot be killed… Thank God it occurred to someone to withdraw Russian troops from Kiev… This decision is God’s inspiration…It put everything in its place…And most importantly. Over the past three weeks our family lost everything: our flat, our dacha, our car – everything… But thank God the children are still alive … Thank God for that.I was left with only one pair of trousers, one pair of shoes, one shirt and one pair of pants… But, I will endure it all… I will endure it all… Because I had a Dream… A Dream that God willing, the “Russian Orcs” will return to my beloved Kiev, to my beloved Bucha, to my beloved village, and I will be able to enlist as a private in order to free my homeland from the rampant Satanism that had tormented our home in Bucha for three days, and tortured my beloved village for ten days…Please, ‘Russian Orcs’, My Dear, Good ones, don’t stop… For Christ’s sake, don’t stop Natives!”Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel\nYasinovataya.

      "content": "The U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin yesterday at a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv said that the United States would return its embassy to the Ukrainian capital in a week.The US Embassy will be headed by new Ambassador Bridget Brink. But the main thing for which a couple of high-ranking visitors came was the discussion of the volume and pace of arms supplies to Ukraine. The guests informed Zelensky about a new $713 million US military aid package. Lloyd Austin also said that immediately after Kyiv he would go to Germany, where a NATO meeting on new arms supplies to Kyiv would be held at the American military base Ramstein. All this news seems to have convinced Zelensky to talk less and less about a diplomatic solution to the conflict. The visitors got their way: they pushed Ukraine to a tough position to talk less about peace negotiations and more about the victories of Ukrainian weapons. For this, as overseas visitors explained, the United States took on the role of organizer of an international coalition to provide military assistance to Ukraine.Zelensky again raised the issue of Joe Biden’s visit to Kyiv at the meeting. The guests answered evasively: Biden himself said in Washington that he was not planning his trip to Kyiv yet. It is extremely important for Zelensky to achieve such a trip in order to show the whole world that the US-led coalition stands firmly on the side of Ukraine in a military conflict with Russia.Recently, Ukrainian propaganda has been convincing residents that a turning point in favor of Kyiv has been outlined in the war with Russia. And as an argument, he cites the withdrawal of Russian troops from near Kyiv, as well as the shelling of the border territories of Russia. This includes the sinking of the cruiser Moskva. Kyiv is also actively exploiting in favor of its thesis the decision of the United States and its NATO partners to supply Ukraine with heavy weapons – artillery and tanks. “It seems that the Ukrainian leaders are determined to prolong the military conflict in every possible way and believe that the longer it lasts, the greater will be Kyiv’s chances for military success. Moreover, the day before, Vladimir Zelensky again announced in an ultimatum form that he would refuse to negotiate during a referendum in the southern territories taken under Russian control”, said Oleg Barabanov, an expert at the Valdai Club.According to him, Kyiv propagandists are convincing the residents of the country that the ongoing resistance of the Azov* militants, blocked at the Azovstal plant, fetters Russian forces and hinders their advance towards Donbass in order to pincer the Ukrainian Armed Forces grouping there. The longer this lasts, the more profitable for the Ukrainian side, although it is clear that the blocked group at Azovstal is doomed.On the eve of the meeting of visitors from the United States with Zelensky, Joe Biden sent them greetings. He, refraining from forecasts on the duration of the Russian military operation in Ukraine, summed up the results of its first two months. And, in particular, he said that after several weeks of shelling of Kyiv, the city is still standing, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky remains in power. In this sense, the withdrawal of Russian troops from Kyiv gives every reason for the West and Ukrainian propagandists to trumpet the victory of Ukrainian weapons. What Biden did: he emphasized that “many brave Ukrainians joined the Ukrainian Armed Forces” and they prevented Russia from conquering their country. Western diplomatic support continues to grow.After Blinken and Austin, UN Secretary General António Guterres and Bulgarian Prime Minister Kirill Petkov will arrive in Kyiv this week. The Prime Minister of Bulgaria, in an interview with BTV on Sunday, said that his trip was intended to convince the coalition Bulgarian government to make a decision on providing military assistance to Ukraine. In the meantime, according to media reports, one of the members of the ruling coalition – the Bulgarian Socialist Party – opposed the supply of weapons to Ukraine, and the other – “Democratic Bulgaria”, – on the contrary, declared the refusal of such supplies unacceptable.In a hurry to Kyiv is also Italian Prime Minister Margot Draghi. His government has come up with a proposal to form a military aid package before his trip to Ukraine, writes the Italian newspapers Repubblica and Corriere della Sera. The package will include one SIDAM 25 self-propelled gun, howitzers and M109 self-propelled guns, which have been in warehouses since the Cold War. In addition, a more modern self-propelled howitzer of 155 mm caliber and a firing range of up to 40 kilometers will also be sent to Ukraine. In general, Italy has collected all the stale military rubbish in order to fit into the chorus of voices in support of sending heavy weapons to Ukraine.Ivan Nemov, IA Antifascist*-banned in RussiaDue to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "Scared out of their wits about the irrelevance of Russian resources, European officials have announced an urgent meeting of the EU Energy Council\nThe most painful problem today will be discussed on May 2: payment for Russian gas in rubles. According to the Polish Minister of Climate and Environment Anna Moskva, the issue will be one of the main agenda items.And the Poles are still hoping for a miracle that the rest of the EU members will show solidarity by agreeing to the same stupidity as Warsaw and Sofia. “Even if the country used to declare payments in rubles, it can give it up,” the Polish official hopes.Apparently, the Polish minister does not fully understand that in case, for example, of a demarche by the FRG, Warsaw would lose its main hope – the gas that comes to it by reverse through Germany. And this, by the way, is also paid for in roubles.However, all expectations that Europe would present a united front in this case are totally unfounded. Slovakia and Hungary, which are 90% dependent on supplies from Russia, would certainly not agree to such a short-sightedness, which Polish and Bulgarian politicians demonstrated, condemning their own economies to big problems. The same situation is with Germany and Austria, no matter how indignant they are about Moscow’s decision. Moreover, as announced by Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó, many European companies importing natural gas from Russia have agreed to the payment scheme proposed by Moscow, but do not say so honestly.Moreover, all those in line to pay are spreading fakes with the help of Western media about Hungary’s position. “I would ask you not to spread false information that there is a common EU position that we Hungarians are shying away from. This is a lie, it is not true, only others are not honest enough, and the international liberal media is looking through their fingers at their devious approach… In order for us too to buy natural gas in the future, in Gazprombank, which is not under sanctions, companies importing natural gas, not countries, but companies, need to open two accounts, one in euros or dollars and one in roubles. And we will do that, just like others. I would like to emphasize that, like others, it’s not true that others have given up on this. They just don’t want to talk about it so honestly for various reasons,” Szijjártó explained, adding that natural gas can only be bought physically, and it would be strange to heat a flat with political posturing and statements.Well, the Hungarian authorities have always been distinguished recently by straightforwardness and even a certain independence in some matters from Brussels and Washington. However, everything that Szijjártó said about the desire of others, chained together, to save themselves from the energy collapse is true. All the more so, if they refuse to sing to Moscow’s notes everyone will face muddle instead of music. According to Shunsuke Kobayashi, chief economist at Japan’s Mizuho Bank, if Russian gas disappears from the market, the world will end because “it’s a matter of life and death for people,” given the blackout, among other things. And one cannot simply reduce consumption of gas by two thirds if it becomes one and a half times more expensive, the expert stated.Although, despite the obvious danger of being stubborn in such a situation, some are not yet in a position to refuse to do something crazy, at least in words. For example, the Czech Republic has once again refused to pay for gas in roubles despite illustrative examples from Poland and Bulgaria. Prague “is not going to give in to Russia’s blackmailing” and it is a mistake that some countries and companies agree to Moscow’s conditions, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala announced cheerfully. He, like the Poles, seems to be recklessly relying on the miracle of a European united front.And everything would be OK – well, the Czech minister just played a foolish game. But no, his colleagues went even further in this matter, demonstrating to the people around him how much Russophobia can corrode one’s brain. For example, the Czech minister of labour and social affairs Marian Jurečka is absolutely sure that his country is not in danger of gas shortage, as it is not only able to save heat, but also resort to the potential of biomethane. In layman’s terms, the Czechs are going to use cow manure. Biomethane can be produced from biogas which is produced in special plants from manure, takes the bread from the fantasists Jurečka.The only thing is to collect a huge amount of manure, with which in the near future the country is likely to be tight, given the sharp rise in feed prices and shortage of fertilizers, again due to anti-Russian sanctions. And also we will have to start buying insanely expensive equipment for the extensive construction of biostations, which will obviously not pay for themselves in the next few years.Anna Ponomaryova, Analytical Service of DonbasDue to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "At approximately two a.m. on 25 April 2022 a fire broke out at two facilities in Bryansk: a storage tank of petroleum products at the oil depot of Transneft Bryansk-Druzhba JSC on Moskovsky Avenue in the Fokinsky district of the city and a tank of 10,000 cubic meters of diesel fuel at the oil complex on Snezhetski Val caught fire. The Investigative Committee of Russia is investigating the circumstances of the incident\nIt is obvious that the fire at the two oil product storage facilities around the same time was not accidental. Experts believe that air strikes, most likely from drones, are the most likely cause. I note that Bryansk is more than 100 kilometres from the Ukrainian border.It is a very interesting coincidence. In the early hours of the same day in the Kursk region, two Ukrainian UAVs were shot down over the village of Borovskoye near the town of Rylsk, 30 kilometres from the border.A pattern has emerged. Every visit to Kiev by a high-ranking Western official is marked by a landmark action against Russia.On 10 April 2022, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was in the Ukrainian capital. On 14 April 2022, the Black Sea Fleet’s flagship cruiser Moskva was seriously damaged and sunk. On 25 April 2022, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken visited Kiev and met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his team. And on the same night, oil storage tanks in Bryansk were hit. Two UAVs failed to reach their targets in the Kursk region.During a meeting on 25 April, Ukrainians were told that the US would provide Ukraine with a new military aid package worth $322 million. In addition, Washington will begin discussions next week on the resumption of diplomatic presence in Ukraine.Interesting fact. After the round of Russian-Ukrainian talks in Istanbul on 29 March 2022, the so-called “Istanbul incident”, diplomatic missions of 16 countries returned to Kiev as of 19 April 2022.The head of the Ukrainian parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, made a landmark statement in an interview with the Ukrayinska Pravda news and analysis website on 25 April 2022. He answered the question about the possibility of changing the Constitution of Ukraine if we receive security guarantees: “Why? If we receive guarantees, we will use these guarantees. And what is written in the constitution about NATO, about the EU, is our perspective vision of the future”.Asked whether Ukraine would amend the constitutional provision on the course to join NATO, he said: “We will not. Changing the constitution is not and will never be an end in itself. It is a toolkit.” As early as mid-March 2022 Stefanchuk did not rule out such a scenario.Military assistance to Ukraine from the US and its allies is enormous. From February 24, 2022, the date of the start of Russia’s special military operation, to April 22, 2022, Kiev received $3.4 billion in funding, and with the $322 million announced on April 25, it comes to about $3.72 billion.On 22 April 2022, the Pentagon published on its website the nomenclature and quantity of weapons for Kiev, outlining them in the form of a detailed list. Let’s quote it in full to make the scale clear:“over 1,400 Stinger MANPADS;more than 5,500 Javelin anti-tank missiles;over 14,000 other anti-tank systems;more than 700 Switchblade tactical UAVs;90 155 mm howitzers and 183,000 155 mm artillery shells;72 tactical trucks to tow 155 mm howitzers;16 Mi-17 helicopters;hundreds of armoured HMMWVs (High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles);200 M113 APCS;more than 7,000 small arms;more than 50,000,000 rounds of ammunition;75,000 sets of body armour and helmets;121 Phoenix Ghost tactical UAVs;laser guided missile systems;Puma UAVs;unmanned coastguard boats;14 anti-artillery radars;2 anti-mine radars;2 air surveillance radars;M18A1 Claymore anti-personnel mines;C-4 explosives and demolition equipment;tactical hardened communications systems;Night vision equipment, thermal imaging systems, optics and laser range finders;Commercial satellite imagery services;Protective explosive ordnance disposal equipment;Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence equipmentMedical supplies, including first aid kits.Judging by this list, the emphasis of arms supply is gradually shifting in favour of heavy systems. Furthermore, it has become known that the USA intends to supply Ukraine with the American M142 HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) missile system.This system includes a 5-ton three wheeled chassis FMTV, which carries two types of equipment: six MLRS rockets with a range of up to 70 km, or a launcher for one missile such as ATACMS (Army TACtical Missile System) with a range of up to 300 km.Delivery in the ATACMS modification does not formally violate the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), as it contains restrictions on deliveries of missile systems and unmanned aerial vehicles capable of delivering payloads weighing 500 kg or more to a range of at least 300 km.Obviously, Kiev will be able to more actively pursue plans to transfer combat operations to Russian territory thanks to the availability of such weapons. Therefore, these missile systems should be priority targets for Russian precision-guided weapons.In an interaction with the press after his trip to Kiev on 25 April 2022, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was asked: “Do you define America’s goals for success in Ukraine any differently now than at the beginning of this war? And if so, what are those goals today?”The Pentagon chief responded as follows: “We want Ukraine to remain a sovereign country, a democratic country capable of defending its sovereign territory. We want to see Russia weakened to the point where it cannot do what it did by invading Ukraine. So, frankly, it has already lost most of its military capability and most of its troops. And we want to make sure that she doesn’t have the ability to replicate that capability very quickly.”Thus, the US sees the armed conflict in Ukraine as a war of attrition for Russia, the result of which should be a critical loss of our country’s military capabilities.It is well known that Rustam Minnekaev, the acting commander of the Central Military District troops, at the annual meeting of the Union of Defence Industries of the Sverdlovsk Region on 22 April 2022 named the main tasks of the second phase of the special military operation in Ukraine:“Since the start of the second phase of the special operation, it has already started literally two days ago, one of the tasks of the Russian army is to establish full control over Donbas and Southern Ukraine. This will provide a land corridor to Crimea, as well as affect vital facilities of the Ukrainian economy.”He also said that “control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria, where there is also evidence of oppression of the Russian-speaking population”.Rustam Minnekayev’s speech was very positively received by the overwhelming majority of Russian citizens. For the first time since the so-called Istanbul incident, the goals for the second phase of the SSR were clearly outlined in the public agenda. The lack of unequivocal information on this topic generated a great deal of rumour, speculation and even defeatist sentiment.It can be assumed that during the second phase of the USO, Russian troops and DNR and LNR troops plan to take full control of the territories of the DNR and LNR within the administrative boundaries of the respective regions, as well as the Kharkiv, Kherson, Zaporozhye, Nikolaev and Odessa regions. This may also include the territory of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Total: eight oblasts.Considering America’s goals in Ukraine, as announced by US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, as well as the Kiev regime’s active attempts to transfer combat operations to Russian territory, the second phase of the USS will clearly not be the last.The natural course of events, escalation, as well as geopolitical factors suggest that the Russian EWS area of operation should gradually extend to the whole of Ukraine.Only the establishment of military control over the entire Ukrainian territory will allow the western project “Ukraine-Anti-Russia” to be completely closed. Ukraine as a state must disappear from the political map of the world. Any other scenario would only be a temporary solution to this problem.Further, part of the regions freed from the Nazi regime in Kiev should eventually be allowed to become part of Russia through procedures established by international law. The rest of the Ukrainian territory, which has also always been an original Russian territory, should be under Russia’s protectorate, with all the ensuing consequences.Aleksandr Vladimirov, RusstratDue to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "One of the rules of war is the elimination of dangerous and leading figures of the enemy\nThe Kiev regime began to demonstrate its readiness for individual terror and its practical application immediately after the 2014 coup, when they started killing opponents and dissenters inside the Maidan country. ERG dispatches to Crimea and Belgorod region, the unanswered liquidation of military leaders of the DNR and LNR by the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces (SDF) and the actions of the radical Mejlis underground* have been taking place for eight years and continue to this day.According to Donetsk mayor Oleksiy Kulemzin, on 1 February 2022 an explosive device planted by Ukrainian saboteurs was found and defused in the administration building of the Kiev district of the city.With the start of the military operation in Ukraine, Kiev called for an all-out guerrilla war in the territories occupied by the Russian army. Demonstrations and killings in Kherson, the arson of a military recruitment office in Henichesk, the bombing of a bridge in Akimovka, near Melitopol, and the 29 April bombing of a police building in the newly liberated town of Kreminna in the Luhansk region demonstrate that terror will escalate in the absence of an adequate response.Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Ukrainian Interior Minister, wrote on Twitter after the terrorist attack in Kreminna: “Attention traitors and occupiers from Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Nova Kakhovka and other temporarily occupied territories. Demand immediately a 10-fold increase in payment for your treachery, medical insurance and life insurance from RosGosStrakh.”The right of Ukrainians to start killing Russian citizens and their fellow citizens has become official. Mikhail Podolyak, advisor to the head of the presidential office, referring to the permission of Blinken (???!!!), left the right to kill Russians to Kiev.The mayor of Dnipropetrovsk, Boris Filatov, who in 2014 promised to “hang afterwards”, has now declared that Ukrainians have the moral right to “calmly and with a completely unclouded mind kill these non-humans (Russians. – A.U.) already all over the world, unlimitedly and in the largest possible quantity”. “Methodically and without unnecessary heroism”. These calls have been heard from the media and the anchor of Ukraine’s Channel 24, Fakhrudin Sharafmal, has demanded the killing of Russian children. Then, however, he apologised, but the screeds don’t burn.The Russophobic hysteria and desire to kill is already taking shape in organisational initiatives. So far, the rabid svidomites have claimed that they have created their own Banderite tribunals where they hand down death sentences to everyone from Pushylin to Kadyrov and have called for the creation of a “database of Rashist monsters”. Now the director of the State Bureau of Investigation (GBI), Oleksiy Sukhachev, is taking up the cause and announcing the creation of a “Ukrainian Mossad”. We, as Jews, will find and punish anyone anywhere in the world.Sukhachev describes his office, which is funded by the State Department with its grants, as “the flagship of investigations into the crimes of the Russian occupiers” and asserts that “given the number of victims and the scale of destruction, the creation of a Ukrainian Mossad is quite justified”, although he admits that the creation of such an office “falls within the competence of the Ukrainian president, the NSDC and parliament”.Military personnel with experience in special operations, professionals from the Main Directorate of Intelligence (GUR), the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVRU), the SBU, the Interior Ministry, the State Service of Ukraine for Technical Protection of Information and the State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection will be recruited into the “mosadniks”. Sukhachev assures that there are more than enough such “fighters” in Ukraine.The pot-bellied “Mossadnik” announced the creation of a new unit within the GBI on the basis of the Main Investigation Department, which will specialise “in investigating war crimes in connection with the aggression of the Russian Federation”.Another object of control is “Russian citizens who entered the territory of Ukraine between 1 December 2021 and 23 February 2022”. This is 11,000 people suspected of assisting the Russian special services and among whom “appropriate filtration measures” are carried out. The regional offices looking for incoming Russians have been added to the case. Is it any wonder that every day Ukrainian security forces report the capture of dozens of agents and spies? And they are demonstrating a flurry of activity and recruiting an exchange fund.Sukhachev promises that the GBR will not forget a single collaborator who has started to collaborate with the Russians. He has already sentenced the mayor and deputies of Izyum city council, Kupyansk, Melitopol, Kherson, Genichesk and Berdyansk. The head of the SBU assures that as of 26 April, more than 320 cases of treason have already been registered.It should be noted that the whites have been raving about Mossad for more than a year. “Vzhopuraneny” commander Semen Semenchenko dreamed about it back in 2015. “I’m talking about an organization similar to Israel’s. Here would be the return of these criminals to the territory of Ukraine for the courts…” – is already Unterfuhrer of Russia-banned Right Sector’ Dmytro Yarosh, 2016.Fugitive TV presenter Yevgeny Kiselev suggested the Mossad-style kidnapping of personified Russians, while prosecutor Ruslan Kravchenko said in 2018 that “we should bring Yanukovych’s fugitive into the country using a specially created unit like Israel’s Mossad”. All this we remember!Finally, a completely stoned Zelensky responded positively to TV presenter Oksana Mazur’s question as to whether he would repeat the Mossad experience of his countrymate Golda Meir.One can assume that the “Mossad initiatives” will continue. It is also obvious that the Ukrainians themselves will not create anything worthwhile. But they will be helped organizationally, informationally and financially. And they will have their backs if anything happens. As they say, an Englishwoman shits and will teach others to shit. So, these “initiatives” by Kiev should be taken very seriously.A certain Ukrainian network of agents has already been created in Russia, and some of the organized Ukrainian communities have long supported the nationalist course of the “historic homeland”. There are also many “Ukrasympathizers” among the Russians.We should not forget about the guest workers, especially from Western Ukraine, who have settled within the oil and gas industry in Siberia and the North and are openly confirming their readiness to sabotage. It is not for nothing that fires have increased across Russia in recent weeks. And the road from petty nastiness to an assassination attempt on those named from Kiev is not that long.How ready Russia is for such a form of war on its territory is difficult to say at the moment. The Russian Federation is still not implementing one of the rules of war – the elimination of dangerous and leading figures of the enemy. And the “Ukromossad” has, in fact, already started its work.\nAndrey Uvarov, FSKDue to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel\nMore like PR – Russia comments on Jolie’s visit to Lviv",

But the residents of the affected cities in unison all told us why the houses were destroyed. Because they were held by Ukrainian nationalists. The military forces of Ukraine simply took these houses of civilians and kept them like a human shield, kept them in these houses to continue their military operations,” Leroy said.On February 24, Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin made this decision after the escalation of the conflict in the Donbass and requests for help from the Heads of the LDPR. In his statement, the Russian leader stressed that the special operation is aimed at the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "The categorical unwillingness of the neo-Nazis of the Azov Battalion, banned in Russia,* who are massively leaving the labyrinths of the industrial zone in Mariupol, to show their faces, is connected with the strict orders of the Ukrainian command to “stand to the last,” former Ukrainian deputy Ilya Kiva has no doubts about this.According to the Ukrainian parliamentarian, the fears of the Nazis are due to the desperate attempt of the radicals to avoid punishment by the highest Ukrainian officials, who ordered the nationalists to die the death of the brave in the struggle for Ukraine. The actions of the militants are commanded by people, some of whom are supporters of right-wing radical associations in Ukraine.Massively born Azovites* are now extremely afraid of persecution by the Ukrainian counterintelligence and its cruel reprisals against themselves and their families. That is why the militants are trying with all their might to get away from a possible hit in the lenses of photo and television cameras.Recall that last night, Azov residents* almost continuously, in small and large groups, massively left the plant, as reported by war correspondent Yuri Kotenok.“By nightfall, Azov crawled in from all the cracks, just like cockroaches escape from dichlorvos. As the first games went, they realized below that they would not beat them with a slipper at the exit. Remember the picture of the Soviet film “Viy”, where demons climb from under the floor? The situation is similar”, the military correspondent wrote in the telegram channel.As the publication “Russian Spring” has already noted, what is happening is the unconditional end of the “underground Ukrainian thousand”.*- prohibited in the Russian FederationDue to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

This was stated by ex-Deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Sergei Markov.According to the head of the Center for Political Studies, the Ukrainian leader gets in touch with the families of the radicals, persistently offering them such deals in exchange for the militants to continue to remain in the catacombs, “heroically” laying down their heads in the fight for “square”.“Interesting news about Azovstal is coming from Kyiv. They say that the office of President Zelensky is negotiating with the families of the Azov* people who are sitting at the blocked plant. They say that Zelensky is very, very dissatisfied with the mass surrender and wants the Azov* people to remain in the basements, ”the expert said in his telegram.At the same time, according to Markov, the life of neo-Nazis staying in the labyrinths of Azovstal will gradually become cheaper – right now it is extremely important for Zelensky to drag out the situation as much as possible and by any means prevent the mass surrender of Ukrainian militants into captivity.“This is still a rumor. From Kyiv. But it’s very likely a true rumor. In our time of general manipulation, informal rumors from the field often reflect the truth more than the media,” PolitRussia quotes.Recall that about a thousand Nazis have already left Azovstal, now they are testifying to Donetsk investigators on the territory of the DPR.* -banned in RussiaDue to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

Just as Ukraine’s fate was decided in Mariupol.Now the enemy will try to hold the Seversk – Soledar – Bakhmut (Artemivsk) line in this direction. However, the fate of Seversk has already been decided: the AFU will not be able to hold the city. Our forces have now liberated the outskirts of Lysychansk – Novodruzhesk, Maloryazantsevo, as well as the settlements between Lysychansk and Seversk: Bilogorivka, Serebryanka, Hryhorivka.I am sure that if the decision is taken by the military command rather than by Zelensky’s office, the Ukrainian army will not hold Seversk but will retreat to the Slavyansk-Kramatorsk and Soledar-Bakhmut (Artemivsk) area.Also in the Seversk direction there are reports of fighting for Dronivka, and it is noted that the settlement will soon be taken. Military targets in Ivano-Daryivka – two depots with ammunition and rocket and artillery weapons – have been hit.

      "content": "A sabotage attempt by Ukrainian militants to arrange a nuclear catastrophe by striking at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant horrified Chinese experts. Indignation at the cynical actions of Kyiv was published by the Sohu publication, PolitRussia reports.In the material, experts described the fact that the Russian military prevented a Ukrainian attempt to smash a nuclear power plant located in the southeastern part of the country to pieces. The criminal Kyiv regime, analysts say, has crossed all conceivable boundaries of what is permitted.“This step by Ukraine is an example of inhumanity, which has nothing to do with military affairs. And it is not clear why the Western media, which constantly portrays itself as well-wishers and champions of morality, completely ignored this incident”, wrote the shocked Sohu authors.The Kyiv authorities, like no one else, are aware of the possible catastrophic consequences of this kind of inhumane actions, experts are convinced: the bomb dropped on the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant could turn the latter into a second Chernobyl, when the accident claimed the lives of 100,000 people, another 300,000 completely lost their health. Radiation particles spread to Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and several European states.“The Kyiv regime knew perfectly well what it was doing, trying to damage the nuclear power plant. Kyiv knew what would become of the civilians who lived nearby. However, the leadership of Ukraine still decided to direct these nuclear weapons against its own people,” Sohu experts emphasized.The Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant is a critical facility, the attack on which in Russia has already been called an act of terrorism, requiring an international investigation. In particular, as stated by the head of the Russian Union of Afghanistan Veterans Franz Klintsevich, the case requires immediate transfer to the International Court of Justice, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the UN Security Council.“Ukraine is controlled from a military point of view by American and other NATO specialists. The Ukrainian military is not independent. Everything related to high-tech weapons is controlled by officers from NATO countries. From the point of view of international law and the Criminal Code of any country, an attack on the Zaporozhye NPP is terrorism. Attacking critical facilities, such as a nuclear power plant, is an act of terrorism.  The worse it gets here, the more people die, get poisoned in Europe, Ukraine, Russia, the better for them,” the military expert emphasized.Recall that Ukrainian militants, at the behest of Kyiv, decided to organize terror by striking at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant using loitering ammunition. In recent days, this was the third attack carried out by Ukrainian nationalists on a critical facility. The nuclear power plant is located on the banks of the Kakhovka reservoir in the city of Energodar and is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "The Russian Foreign Ministry expresses concern about the situation that has developed around the systematic military provocations and the spread of disinformation by Ukraine against Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Zaporozhye.“Recently, the tense situation around the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), which is being whipped up by the Ukrainian authorities, has been causing increasing concern, including by spreading disinformation about the allegedly negative impact of Russian representatives present at it on ensuring the safety of the plant,” said Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharov in a comment on the website of the department.She stressed that Russia behaves extremely responsibly in relation to Ukrainian nuclear facilities. Its principles are to ensure the maximum level of security of energy facilities, as well as the implementation of the transparency of their actions in working with them.The comment also refers to the visit of an international commission to the Zaporozhye NPP, which was being prepared jointly with the IAEA secretariat, under the leadership of the Agency’s Director General Rafael Grossi. The purpose of the trip was to carry out activities within the framework of the implementation of IAEA safeguards, as well as to verify compliance with safety standards at ZNPP.It is noted with regret that this visit has not yet taken place due to the irresponsible, in the opinion of the Russian Foreign Ministry, position of the leadership of the UN Secretariat, which “under far-fetched pretexts of insufficient security and untimeliness of this event, refused to support the initiative of the IAEA Secretariat.”“It was after the disruption of the visit that the number of Kyiv’s armed provocations directed against the Zaporizhia NPP increased many times over: strikes were carried out on the territory of the plant using unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as actions aimed at intimidating its personnel,” the statement says.According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, the continuation of armed provocations at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant could lead to a nuclear accident, the catastrophic consequences of which will affect not only Ukraine. Russia appeals to the international community with a request to be vigilant in this matter and condemn the Kyiv regime, the conclusion says.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

After the Ukrainian POWs began to talk about the crimes they had committed under the orders of the Ukrainian political authorities, the US HIMARS system was struck here. The Ukrainian authorities even went as far as using this type of weaponry, of which they have very few, to silence those military personnel who started to tell the truth about what was happening here in Donbass,” he told reporters.As previously reported, the Ukrainian armed forces’ strike on the remand prison in Yelenivka killed 53 prisoners and injured 75 more. In addition, eight staff members of the colony were injured.The Russian Defence Ministry earlier described the attack as a bloody provocation, stressing that it was carried out to intimidate the Ukrainian military, who are increasingly surrendering to the Russian side.The head of the Donetsk people’s republic, Denys Pushylin, also said that the captured fighters had started giving inconvenient testimony to Kiev. Among those held in the remand centre in Yelenivka were members of Azov. The Russian Investigative Committee opened a criminal case over the attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.According to the Voyenkor 🅉 Medvedev Telegram channel, the strike on the pre-detention centre was deliberate, as the Ukrainian fighters knew and told facts which were not beneficial to the Western side.“The fact of holding Ukrainian prisoners in Yelenivka is common knowledge. And the Kiev artillery’s strike on the place where they are being held, in my opinion, is not a coincidence. They willingly talk, telling not the most convenient facts for Kiev and the West. The shelling, which caused the deaths of at least forty people, is in fact an attempt by Kiev to shut them up. And yet another confirmation: the Nazis don’t have their own,” the report says.",

      "content": "A French volunteer and writer, former military man Adrian Boke, who visited Ukraine, said that he witnessed the preparation of a provocation in the Kiev suburb of Bucha, RIA Novosti reports.In April, Andrian Boke visited Ukraine twice on a mission to deliver humanitarian aid, medical equipment and medicines. He visited both the Polish-Ukrainian border and Bucha, and saw how Russian prisoners of war are being tortured and killed, as well as how Ukrainian militants are engaged in a staged massacre of civilians.“When I talk about murders and torture, I am talking about the murder and torture of the Russian military. First of all, the officers were executed. I heard screams when the Azov people asked who the officer was here. As soon as the answer sounded, this person was immediately shot in the head  The worst thing is that I did not see any human attitude, there were no emotions, because in front of my eyes people were executed, people were hurt, people were shot, shot in limbs , in the head,” said Boke.According to his story, he witnessed the torture and murder of Russian prisoners of war in a hangar in the northern part of Bucha. It was in early April, that is, when the Ukrainian military had regained control of the city for several days, RIA Novosti specifies.Boke said that he often talked with the fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the “Azov”, who impressed him with their inhuman treatment of Russians, Jews and people of other races.“I had to pretend a lot so as not to show my opinion and emotions and in the first place not to show disagreement with their opinion. Disagreement with their Nazi ideology, especially when they expressed their attitude towards Jews and people with dark skin, because these were very cruel statements. And first of all, I am talking about hatred for Russians, because they  call you “Russian dogs”. And for all these soldiers, for the soldiers from the Azov Battalion, the main task, as they always told me, is to torture and kill “Russian dogs”. As a former military man, this surprised me. Because it was evident in everything that their main goal was to torture and kill “Russian dogs”, while they did not even talk about the liberation of their population”, recalls the volunteer.In addition, he talks about how a provocation is being prepared in Bucha to accuse the Russian military of massacres of civilians.“When we entered Bucha by car, I was in the passenger seat. And when we drove through the city, I saw the bodies of people on the sides of the streets, and at the same time, in front of my eyes, the bodies of people were taken out of the trucks, which were laid out next to the bodies lying on the ground to give the effect of mass deaths”, Boke said.He clarified that there were journalists nearby who immediately began filming as soon as a group of bodies formed.“One of the volunteers who was at this place the day before, I emphasize that it was not I who saw it, but one of the volunteers told me this. He told me that he had seen the day before, refrigerated trucks from other cities of Ukraine arrived in Bucha, from which the bodies of people were unloaded and laid out in rows. From this, I realized that there are dramatizations and extras”, the agency quotes the interlocutor.Volunteers and local residents were pressured – to avoid publicity, the militants threatened them with imprisonment and reprisals, the volunteer noted.“We distributed medicines, including those containing narcotic substances, painkillers containing morphine. We were told in plain text: if you don’t share with us, you won’t get where you need to go. I clearly remember that we had to deliver these pain medications to the children’s hospital and we were told that if we did not share, we would not get there. Moreover, when we were not far from Bucha, we were accompanied by military guards, they were “Azov”. They escorted us to one of the hangars and told us to prepare a separate box with drugs containing morphine so that we could move on,” Boke said.In addition, volunteers were forbidden to take photos and videos.“We were warned that otherwise we would face a ten-year sentence or more severe consequences. This ban also extended to the local population. This pressure was exerted by the military, primarily by the Azov people. Europe today does not understand how much the population of Ukraine is under strong pressure”, said the Frenchman.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

Zelensky obviously didn’t want to expand the circle of those who were notified, and it was also not supposed to leave living witnesses, because the “martyrs” were sentenced for the second time,” he shared this opinion in his Telegram channel.The diplomat noted that fragments of HIMARS missiles found on the spot do not give room for fantasies from where and from whom this missile flew. “It flew from the Ukrainian side and accurate aiming was provided by American intelligence. In the same way as for other civilian targets that were previously hit from this product of the American military-industrial complex”, the politician writes.“The sentence was carried out harshly and not sentimentally. They killed their own citizens, executed combatants who laid down their arms, committed an extrajudicial execution. More than enough for a war crime without a statute of limitations,” Miroshnik said.The ambassador noted that Ukrainian and foreign indignation at the passing of death sentences on mercenaries by the Donetsk court can also be put an end to. “We just need to prepare for the tribunal, where it will be another bright page for which no amnesty is provided,” the diplomat concluded.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

Zelensky and Washington initiated the missile attack on the pre-trial detention center in Yelenovka. This was done for one purpose: to prevent the new Nuremberg trial, where the captured Nazis – Azov people, would begin to testify”, Volodin said.Volodin is convinced that Kyiv and Washington wanted to “remove” witnesses of crimes against humanity so that the citizens of the EU and the United States “do not turn away from them”, and the supply of weapons would continue.Recall that the official representative of the Russian Ministry of Defense, Igor Konashenkov, confirmed that the Armed Forces of Ukraine attacked the pre-trial detention center from the HIMARS MLRS, where prisoners of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, including “Azov”, are being held.

      "content": "The Kyiv junta ordered the Armed Forces of Ukraine to get rid of witnesses of the atrocious crimes of nationalists in the territory of Donbass. This opinion was expressed by expert in political science, publicist and blogger Asya Abdulova in an interview with the Federal News Agency, commenting on the situation with the shooting of a bus of citizens from the Kherson region.Recall that official Kyiv called on the civilian population to leave the Kherson region and other territories of the south as soon as possible, which were liberated and successfully denazified by the RF Armed Forces during a special operation to force Ukraine to peace. A certain number of local residents decided to evacuate to the lands controlled by the Kyiv junta, which, according to the blogger, was their big mistake.“It has long been clear that such statements are made to show their American and British masters that they are in control of the situation and can host Ukrainian citizens. But as we all see, refugees from the eastern and southern regions remain completely unsettled on the territory of Ukraine. In the western regions, they are forced to speak only Ukrainian, and the prices for renting temporary housing are simply cosmic. For people from the southeastern regions, there is no social protection from the state,” the blogger said.According to the blogger, the criminal Kyiv regime is not at all interested in civilians, while the population of the South-Eastern territory of Kyiv does not recognize them as people at all, which explains the frequent cases of their brutal destruction.“We all remember how the SBU and the Armed Forces of Ukraine deliberately shot refugees from Mariupol and other settlements when the residents were saving their lives. They didn’t care where they ran, they just wanted to survive. The incident with the shooting of a bus of citizens from the Kherson region was no exception”, the publicist noted.At the same time, according to the expert, the Kyiv elite is actively trying to “hide their malicious track”, hiding the bloody crimes of Ukrainian nationalists, who cynically and cold-bloodedly killed many innocent civilians, and therefore the Ukrainian authorities will by any means get rid of potential witnesses who can shock the world the truth about the war crimes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.“Unfortunately, today Ukraine is ruled by the bloodthirsty Kyiv junta, which is indifferent to the future of the people. For them, the main thing is to use people as a human shield, and the social infrastructure for their terrorist plans,” the editor-in-chief of the Abdulova Info website emphasized.Recall that the Ukrainian national battalions are famous for concentrating heavy equipment in residential areas, and without hesitation equipping firing positions in schools, kindergartens and medical institutions, not disdaining to lay even bombs there. In addition, the militants do not disdain to shoot from the windows of residential buildings, while people are in them.In the spring, the Ukrainian regime, using Tochka-U, cynically attacked the Kramatorsk bus station: civilians were preparing for a mass self-evacuation there. The brutal action was aimed at the subsequent accusation of Russia of “aggression” and, in addition, blocking the innocent population within the city to prevent the attacks of the allied forces on the military targets of the enemy, shamefully and cold-bloodedly fortifying firing positions and placing equipment in residential areas.A special military operation was launched on the territory of Ukraine by Russian leader Vladimir Putin on February 24. Its main goals were the complete denazification and demilitarization of the criminal Kyiv regime, which for eight years subjected the civilian population of Donbass to harassment and genocide with impunity.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

In parallel with this, it is known that he is also currently attempting to obtain funding from large Ukrainian businessmen, offering armed protection for their families and properties in return.In this way, a new under-controlled OCG has been formed in Kiev with the assistance of MID officers.

      "content": "Vice-Chancellor, Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection of Germany Robert Habek ruled out extending the life of the remaining three nuclear power plants (NPP) in the country in order to save gas, Reuters reports.Robert Habek said at the Open Doors Day at the German Ministry of Economy that if the nuclear power plant continues to operate, gas consumption can be reduced by a maximum of 2%.“For the little that we will gain there, this is the wrong decision,” the minister said, adding that there are other ways to save gas. “This is not the cheapest, and also not the safest technology for supplying Europe and the world in the future,” said the head of the German Ministry of Economy. However, he pointed out that a return to nuclear power would only cause serious public debate.Habek accused the Bavarian authorities of mistakes in energy policy. For example, possible power outages in the winter, he said, could be the result of political mistakes in Bavaria, since renewable energy sources are underdeveloped in the “southeastern region of Germany”. In particular, the head of the Ministry of Economy noted that the Prime Minister of Bavaria, Markus Söder, always refers to the well-developed solar energy in the region.“The only problem is that the sun doesn’t shine at night in Bavaria either, and the days in Bavaria are shorter in January. This means that nothing can be done with solar energy at night in Bavaria in January, other sources are needed. They have not been expanded,” the Vice Chancellor says.This could be compensated by electricity from the northern part of Germany if the electrical networks were expanded, which, however, did not happen sufficiently. Under certain circumstances, according to Habek, this can become a problem. Germany is an electricity exporting country, there is a European electricity trade, Habek concluded. In this context, the minister assured that the situation in winter is currently being calculated.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "In Ukraine, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is trying to hide the loss of American HIMARS multiple launch rocket systems by trying to pass off the destroyed vehicles as wooden models. News about this appeared at the moment when the information field began to receive massive reports that about 60% of the HIMARS delivered to Ukraine were destroyed by the Russian Armed Forces.\nThe Washington Post published an article reporting how the Ukrainian military has developed a fleet of wooden decoys that resemble US missile systems. Thus, the Ukrainian military claims, they are trying to trick the Russian army into spending expensive long-range cruise missiles to destroy them.The publication was even sent photographs of copies, after reviewing which WP came to the conclusion that false targets made of wood outwardly practically do not differ from an artillery battery for the optics of Russian unmanned vehicles (UAVs), which transmit the coordinates of their location to naval carriers of cruise missiles in the Black Sea.It is noteworthy that the WP article about the alleged use of mock-ups by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to imitate decoys appeared after the information that the Ukrainian army lost about 60% of the 16 units of the HIMASR RZSO delivered to it. The Armed Forces of Ukraine told the newspaper that a few weeks after the start of this practice, false targets allegedly resulted in strikes by at least 10 Kalibr cruise missiles.The Ukrainian expert community asked a logical question: how expedient is it to give out information about a successfully working tactic to the enemy? If this method effectively induces the Russian side to waste expensive missiles, why trumpet it to the whole world? Much simpler explanations were found – in this way the Armed Forces of Ukraine are trying to hide the real losses of the Western MLRS, stating that all the targets were wooden.Recall that the supply of American HIMARS rocket launchers to Ukraine really pursues one goal: to demonstrate to the world the effectiveness of these systems. 16 units sent to Kyiv, when the Russian army puts up ten for each vehicle, which Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny personally admitted, is unlikely to have a positive effect on the combat capability of Ukraine. The advertising campaign was all that the Pentagon demanded from Ukraine.\nOfficial information from their manufacturer LH Martin speaks of a multiplied increase in the cost of this type of equipment in recent months, but most importantly, an increase in orders for them. However, after regular news about their mediocre losses in Ukraine, the PR company of the achievements of the American military-industrial complex is under great threat, which urgently needs to be covered with wooden models.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

It was planned to close them by 2023, however, due to the looming energy crisis, they are likely to continue operating.According to the newspaper, the decision to continue operating the nuclear power plants has not yet been approved by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. However, the government believes that there are two essential conditions that will extend the life of nuclear power plants.

      "content": "On the evening of the same day, missile strikes knocked out several of Ukraine’s largest thermal power plants, followed by rolling blackouts in the east of the country. Thus, the Kiev regime is losing one of its last trump cards – electricity sales to Europe, which it hoped to use to pay off its Western supervisors.On the evening of 11 September, after the sixth unit of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant was shut down and several thermal power plants were put out of service, Ukraine began to experience power outages. The head of the Kiev regime, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said that as a result of the missile strikes, Kharkiv, Donetsk, and partially Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhya and Sumy regions were completely de-energized. Problems with electricity were also observed in Poltava and Odessa regions.Apart from CHPP-5 in Kharkiv and Zmiyevskaya CHPP in Kharkiv region, fires occurred at Pavlogradskaya CHPP-3 in Dnipropetrovsk region, as well as at Kremenchukskaya CHPP in Poltava region.As a result, the underground in Kharkiv stopped working and people had to get out of the underground tunnels on foot. In Poltava, trolleybuses caught fire due to power surges. The railway company Ukrzaliznytsia, in turn, reported mass delays of trains.In addition to problems with the underground, all other urban infrastructure in Kharkiv “went down” – supermarkets, petrol stations, ground transport, ATMs, terminals, and the water supply was also cut off. Similar problems have been observed in other cities.In his statement, Zelensky blamed Russia for what happened and accused the Kremlin of terrorist acts “before the eyes of the civilized world”.A similar post was also published by Mykhaylo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the Ukrainian presidential office: “Direct deliberate strikes on critical civil infrastructure, in particular on Kharkiv’s largest thermal power plant-5, are an unequivocal manifestation of Russian terrorism”.“Look at this! It turns out you can’t hit civilian infrastructure! It turns out this is a ‘manifestation of terrorism’. It is possible to leave Crimea without light, Donetsk without water, Podolyak did not see any terrorism in this. Neither did his Western patrons,” political analyst Vladimir Kornilov responded to the statement.Meanwhile, the Russian Defence Ministry said in a brief on 10 September: “The Kiev regime, with the aim of destabilizing the situation on the territory freed by the Russian Armed Forces and causing suffering to the civilian population, continues deliberate shelling of the energy infrastructure: generation facilities, transformer substations and power lines.The social media immediately started spreading rather contradictory news – both posts that Ukraine was shelling its own power plants in order to shift the blame on Russia, and information that it was the Russian Armed Forces that were responsible for the strikes.Later, news appeared on the Internet that the Kharkiv and Kremenchuk thermal power plants were hit by missile strikes from the waters of the Caspian Sea using Kalibers.In their turn, some experts unambiguously regarded the incident as a result of actions of the Russian military.As political scientist and historian Armen Gasparyan noted, the power cuts were Moscow’s response to the statements of some Kiev politicians: “What is electrification? It is an achievement of the Soviet authorities! Vladimir Vladimirovich said that “we will show you real decommunisation”. And Ukraine was going to completely abandon the Russian heritage… It seems to me that the blackout is a good, correct story of getting rid of everything Russian”.According to military expert Yakov Kedmi, by carrying out strikes on energy infrastructure, Russia wants Ukraine to stop shelling the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant.“Why Kiev needs this, I personally don’t understand. Why Moscow needs it, I understand – and very well. Thus Moscow makes it clear to Kiev in the language they understand that for every sly fox there is a nut with a left thread. And if they do not stop messing around with the ZNPP issue they will have to keep explaining to their population why they are sitting without electricity”, he said.The military expert Boris Rozhin reminds that since 1991 Ukraine has not built a single new TPP: “All operating TPPs were built by “cursed communists” from 1950s to 1980s. In other words, each destroyed TPP is in fact an irrevocable loss for Ukraine, just like the oil refinery. The Ukrainian Nazis are only users of other people’s labour”.At the same time, the analyst stressed that taking two power plants out of action is too little for a long-term blackout: “Now they will somehow twist and restore power supply, after all there are working nuclear power plants. But with a longer-term impact and further outage of the thermal power plants, the problem will become systemic and mostly unrecoverable.The incident coincided not only with the withdrawal of Russian troops from the occupied positions in Kharkiv Region, but also with Zelensky’s declaration of his intention to supply electricity to Europe.On 9 September he held a meeting with Polish Prime Minister Matteusz Morawiecki and Latvian President Egils Levits, assuring those that he would increase the supply of electricity to the EU. To carry out the plan he was instructed to rebuild the power line from the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant to Rzeszow, Poland, to be completed by 8 December.The Ukrainian head of state has previously put forward similar initiatives. At the end of June, he proposed to export electricity to the EU: “Ukrainian electricity can replace a considerable part of Russian gas consumed by Europeans. So it’s not just an issue of export revenues for us, it’s a security issue for Europe”.We would like to recall that in March, the Ukrainian energy system was disconnected from the Russian-Belarusian system and synchronized with the European one (ENTSO-E). This allowed Ukrenergo to hold regular auctions, selling access to the interstate power grid.Thus it becomes clear that the cessation of operation of Zaporizhzhia NPP has already deprived the Kiev regime of a significant portion of revenues, while the removal of other energy infrastructure facilities will generally put an end to Ukraine’s earnings from electricity sales, which will deliver another powerful blow to the country’s economy.Nikolay Ulyanov, Rubaltic.ruDue to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "Late in the evening of September 13, information began to emerge about an AFU offensive on the village of Davydov Brod in the Kherson region. However, the raid could not be called successful: the attack was successfully repulsed, and the Ukrainian army was pushed back beyond the positions it had occupied before the attack.– Davydov Brod is on lockdown. Another attack by the Ukranazis has been repulsed. The latest statements by Ukrainian media about the breakthrough of the defence line at Davydov Brod are untrue,” the deputy head of the regional administration, Kyrylo Stremousov, said. He added that the settlement was periodically attacked, but they were successfully repelled by the Russian Army.At the same time, Ukrainian channels broadcast a wave of fakes about the capture of Kyselivka near Kherson by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. That Russian troops were allegedly retreating and that the front line was shifting towards Chornobaivka and Kherson. In reality, the line of battle is not shifting in favour of the AFU, because there is no advance of the AFU in this area.– Yes, there was a report, they tried to enter, but in fact they are now lying in the fields, no one even takes them away,” the commander of the fire support platoon of the 127th DNR regiment, call sign Sych, told reporters.According to him, about 1,200 Ukrainian fighters were killed in the senseless attack. The total losses during the second unsuccessful breakthrough by the AFU to Kherson0 have yet to be calculated. During the first offensive, which began on 29 August, the enemy lost at least five thousand men, and the total losses, including those wounded and missing, could be as high as ten thousand.There is a simple military arithmetic that says that offensive operations are ten times more expensive than defensive ones. Particularly if the army is attacking with the last of its strength. The Ukrainian Armed Forces are trying to break through in different directions, but the Ukrainian army has not learned how to consolidate in the territories left behind during the regrouping. And this, according to military experts, may play a cruel joke on the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Military expert Oleksiy Leonkov noted that the AFU was created to provoke Russia into a conflict and subsequently wage war from defence, depleting military and economic resources as much as possible with the help of Western partners, and such tactics have no serious prospects:“They have not succeeded in conducting successful offensive operations, and the armed forces as a whole cannot be said to be Ukrainian. Yes, they are fighting under the Ukrainian flag. But foreign mercenaries, fighters from terrorist organizations, led by instructors and even members of the US and UK military were involved. It is quite possible that they are specialists in punitive operations, but not in offensive ones.US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken was quick to declare that the so-called counter-offensive by the AFU had been carefully planned and backed by America and other countries. However, he immediately had to qualify, perhaps with an eye to the future, that Russia retains “significant forces” in Ukraine, including weapons and ammunition.While Ukrainian officials continue to fabricate victories on the Internet, Blinken is hedging and already lying, misleading not only the Ukrainian side, but the West as a whole. The state of affairs is such that the counter-offensive by the AFU, after several attempts, has actually stopped, there is no active fighting, which indicates the inability to develop the offensive with large forces.In Ukraine, they are puzzled by this paradox. On the one hand, there is euphoria over the touted counter-offensive and the announcement of attempts to break through to other directions. On the other hand, there are endless ambulances, wounded and killed, and equipment destroyed and abandoned by the Ukrainian armed forces. Hundreds and thousands killed, even more wounded.Between 6 and 10 September, the Russian Air Force destroyed more than four thousand Ukrainian fighters in the Nikolaevsko-Krivorozhskaya and Kharkov directions and wounded more than eight thousand. On 11 September, another 450 AFU fighters destroyed near Kharkiv became known. The number of eliminated equipment numbered in tens of units. On 13 September, the Russian Armed Forces destroyed a foreign mercenary base in the Kharkiv direction.At the same time, Kiev, which is accustomed to acting at a push, or as it is nicknamed in the 127th DNR regiment “froggy swoop,” is announcing the liberation of Russian-controlled territories over and over again. In a sporting analogy, the AFU is a sprinter, but not a stayer. As soon as the fighting drags on, all the enemy’s problems are revealed. For this reason, military experts call the AFU “the army of one sprint”. In part, this nickname stuck with the Ukrainian military after the defeat in the fields of Kherson, when an entire motorized rifle brigade fell into the firing bag at Sukhoy Stavka.Former UN weapons inspector in Iraq Scott Ritter noted that an attack by the AFU in any of the selected areas was spontaneous and always resulted in great bloodshed. Ritter noted that the AFU demonstrated a brief fuse that faded as quickly as it appeared. And when the time for heavy fieldwork began, the Ukrainians had no energy left. Some military experts are already suggesting that by acting in this way, the Ukrainian armed forces are driving themselves into a trap. Russian artillery and combat aviation are working on the accumulations of enemy and AFU equipment. According to some reports, the crew of one attack helicopter hits at least two armoured targets during the night. Tanks, vehicles, MLRS and other enemy weapons are destroyed.The AFU entered the autumn with chronic problems. The first and most important was a serious crisis of vehicles. According to military experts, the enemy transports manpower and ammunition to the war zone in civilian trucks taken from the population. The use of tank transporters, which are woefully inadequate, is decreasing, and tanks and BMPs are increasingly being driven on their own, which causes them to wear out and break down quickly.The personnel situation is alarming. Professionals continue to die, while citizens mobilised hastily refuse to fight and are deliberately taken prisoner in order to keep themselves alive.“They have, by the way, a new wave of mobilisation being prepared there, the sixth, and they will put everyone from 18 and above under arms. The antidote to this could be the collapse of Ukraine’s military and administrative infrastructure,” states Alexei Leonkov.According to the laws of military strategy, long-term planning requires first and foremost taking care of the home front. Organise production and modernisation of weapons and repair of equipment. During World War II Joseph Stalin, Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the U.S.S.R., requested weaponry from the West in addition to weapons. Soviet authorities evacuated factories to the rear and actively built new ones. It was a long and hard work for the future. It paid off in the end.Kiev has not learned to work for the future, and the authorities do not show any steps towards industrial independence, especially military independence. The construction of factories for the production of its own weapons is out of the question, even though now Ukraine doesn’t even produce cartridges, and the modernisation of armaments is impossible because of the lack of large factories. Therefore Kiev counts on a short-term PR campaign.The fruits of this strategy are already visible today: no matter where an attack by the AFU is planned, the Ukrainian army cannot operate for longer than 7-10 days. However, quick and local operations are also constantly thwarted: three landings on the Zaporizhzhia NPP failed, the second offensive on Kherson was repulsed, and the Ukrainian Armed Forces have fallen into the same trap as a month ago. If Kiev uses the tactic of “thousands of cuts”, as stated by advisor to the Office of the President of Ukraine Mikhail Podolyak, then they are cutting themselves on their own knife and the wounds are bleeding more and more.It follows from all this that Kiev is still entirely dependent on the “kind West”; of its own the Zelensky regime has only administrative and punitive resources left to carry out violent mobilization, propaganda writing about non-existent victories, and an army that has been fighting with NATO equipment, which it cannot restore on its own.According to a number of experts, the Armed Forces have become a conglomeration of mercenaries, cannon fodder and fighters fighting under the Ukrainian flag. Illogical and self-destructive in terms of military art, but explainable in terms of PR, actions will sooner or later lead to the fact that the AFU will fall into a trap, from which it will not be able to get out.Sergey Andreev, LIFEDue to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel\nThe US Congress has again demanded that Russia be recognised as a “sponsor of terrorism”.",

Take away this tool from Kiev, surrender it so that it is they who are afraid, afraid to the point of trembling in their knees, expecting death every minute – and everything will fall apart for them.Nikolay SevostyanovDue to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

Many have left, and those of us who are still here know that anytime and anywhere a Ukrainian shell can fall. These are punitive attacks: they punish ordinary people just for living here. Defence systems seem unable to detect or prevent this terrorism . We know these are mobile, long-range artillery systems that are very difficult to detect,” Kirk said.For this reason, many are demanding more decisive action, no longer against the AFU, but against those who command this barbarism, in Kiev and elsewhere in Ukraine.

      "content": "The All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion today published the results of sociological research on referendums in the republics of Donbass and NovorossiaIn the DPR and LPR, 87% of the respondents planned to come to the polling stations, in Zaporizhia – 80%, in the Kherson region – 69%. The absolute majority of voters support the entry of their regions into Russia: 97% each in the Donetsk and Lugansk republics, 87% in Zaporozhye and 89% in the Kherson region.But these are just dry reports of sociological research. And the fact that they did not give an accurate picture of the possible results (there are likely to be more people who want to live in Russia) we will find out in a few days, when the official vote count is completed. But even now, on the first day of the referendum, it can be seen without statistics how people are in a hurry to dissociate themselves from Ukrainian Nazism and its tactics of Russian genocide, the deliberate destruction of the civilian population with NATO weapons.And if everything was clear with the Donbass from the very beginning, for the republics the referendum was gained through years of war, then in the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, the rethinking took place literally in a matter of months and despite the long-term work of the Ukrainian agitprop. Evidence of this is the queues of those wishing to vote at a mobile polling station in the seaport of Kherson, where every resident of the city can participate in the referendum.The video, which was published by many media, has already circled the information space. “Voting has begun, many people are coming, they are all active, everyone wants our region to join Russia, everyone is positive,” RIA Novosti quotes an employee of the election commission as saying.People lined up in the morning and in other areas. Kherson residents are driven, first of all, by the actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which shelled the city today: the people voted to the sound of arrivals at a time when the Russian air defense forces repelled the attack. More than ten times during the night the nationalists attacked Novaya Kakhovka. In the morning, an explosive device went off in the center of Zaporozhye Melitopol. Six HIMARS missiles were fired at Stakhanov in the LPR. American MLRS were also used in the shelling of Gorlovka in the DPR.Kyiv, as expected, is trying to disrupt the vote and intimidate local residents. However, these efforts are useless. In the liberated Melitopol, a motor rally was even held on the occasion of the referendum. Dozens of cars drove off with the flags of Russia and Zaporizhzhia in the greeting oncoming signals of other cars. As in Kherson, the Cossacks do not hide the fact that they are making their choice in favor of reunification with Russia.People are lining up in Russian regions, where hundreds of polling stations have opened for refugees. IDPs from Donbass, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions are massively willing to take part in a referendum on joining Russia, the press service of the election commission of the Belgorod region reports. And this picture is typical for any region of the country.In turn, the Kremlin today promised that the process of joining the republics of Donbass and other liberated territories into the Russian Federation, if the appropriate decision is made at the referendums, will be carried out quickly, as stated by presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Moscow is not going to delay this decision. It will only take certain actions of “our parliament and the president, the signing of the necessary documents.”As practice shows, procedures that require swiftness are carried out in our country in high-speed mode. So in the near future, Russia will consider all attempts by Ukraine to “return” the Donbass and Novorossia as attacks on its territory.Anna Ponomareva, Analytical Service of DonbassDue to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) writes about this, citing US officials.The newspaper refers to the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics, as well as the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, which decided to organize referendums on joining Russia. The United States dubbed it an attempt by Russia to “annex” the territories of Ukraine.The publication believes that the Biden administration has not yet provided Kyiv with ATACMS (Army tactical missile system) ballistic missiles with a range of up to 300 km. Moreover, it was previously reported that the US authorities agreed with Ukraine that the Armed Forces of Ukraine would not use the supplied HIMARS missiles and other projectiles for attacks on Russian territory.Experts interviewed by the publication say “threats and counter-threats” from both sides increase the likelihood that some of the “deterrent mechanisms” in place to prevent further escalation of the conflict in Ukraine may stop working. At the same time, according to US officials, at the moment there is no evidence that Russia is preparing to use tactical nuclear weapons.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "September 25 marks the end of the third of five days of voting in referendums in Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, as well as in the DPR and LPR. No one doubts the result of the vote: it is obvious that the locals will support reunification with Russia (in the DPR and LPR this has been expected for almost eight years)The event is definitely the most important. It not only completely changes the course of the special military operation (now there can be no question of any return of these territories to Ukraine: the Constitution of the Russian Federation directly prohibits even negotiating the rejection of these territories), but also demonstrates that a strong-willed decision of a sovereign country can be implemented across Western Wishlist. It is not surprising that this implementation is covered by all the world’s media, including Western ones.However, if someone believes that professional journalists from the US and Europe sent correspondents to the liberated regions of Ukraine to see what was happening on the spot, after which they made reports and articles, then this someone still does not understand one simple thing. He does not understand that professional political journalism in the West has died and it has been replaced by propagandists with manuals who are absolutely not shy about deceiving their readers.Yes, in some ways they did not deceive.“The outcome of the so-called referendums on whether four regions of Ukraine, at least partly controlled by Moscow, should join the Russian Federation was not in doubt after the opening of the polls,” writes The Wall Street Journal.However, the publication – like other Western media with politicians – made this conclusion by no means on the basis that the lion’s share of the inhabitants of the liberated territories is in favor of joining Russia. No, this confidence is justified by other points.First, by statements that the referendum was rigged. According to British Foreign Secretary James Cleverley, the United Kingdom allegedly has evidence that Russian officials have already set figures for “a fictitious turnout and percentage of approval in these fictitious referendums.” After all, the West assures its citizens that local residents are very often waiting for the return of the Ukrainian authorities.The claim to report from the margins was made by The New York Times. There appeared a column by a certain Sasha Vasilyuk, who is presented as a Russian writer from the United States with relatives in Ukraine. And, referring to his uncle and aunt allegedly living in Donetsk, the author draws a picture that in the capital of the DPR “everything is so unambiguous.” That there is supposedly a huge number of supporters of Ukraine who live “under the heel of the occupier” and hope that Ukraine will come to them after all. And, of course, against the referendum.“I don’t know anyone who plans to vote, unless they come to our house and put us at gunpoint,” the author quotes his aunt.Accordingly, since the acquaintances of the “author’s aunts” did not vote, it means that no one is voting.– The results will be fictive. I wonder if anyone will come to vote? – asks the British Ambassador to Ukraine Melinda Simmons.Apparently, the respected Madam Ambassador did not bother to watch the videos (let alone come and watch live) with queues of people at the polling stations. Moreover, there are queues even in those cities that are under regular shelling by Ukrainian militants.Secondly, confidence in the outcome of the vote is based on Russian weapons. The Western media turned the Russian military, who guarded order on the streets and the safety of election commission employees, into Cerberus, allegedly forcing people to vote.“Russia Conducts Staged Voting in Ukraine with Kalashnikov Rifles,” reads a headline in The Washington Post.Apparently, this title is new – it was changed after publication. And initially it sounded like this: “Russia, at gunpoint, is driving Ukrainians to staged referendums.”“There were many videos of people filling out ballots under the watchful eye of the police,” writes The Guardian.Two types of arguments are used as evidence for this “version”. First of all, the statements of Kyiv officials who call themselves the authorities of these territories.“The so-called referendum is more like a public opinion poll at gunpoint,” says the Ukrainian “Governor of the Lugansk region” Sergei Gaidai.“Election commissions, accompanied by armed soldiers, roam the region and continue to hunt for voters,” says “First Deputy Head of the Kherson Regional Council” Yuri Sobolevsky.“They knock loudly, ring the doorbell, give people ballots and indicate with a rifle where to put a mark,” exiled Ukrainian “mayor of the city of Energodar” Dmitry Orlov is indignant.In addition, evidence of “wandering military men” is put into the mouths of residents of the liberated regions specially invented for this purpose, with whom the correspondents (not present on site) allegedly talked remotely (naturally, without any verification).– Residents describe a frightening scene: soldiers in balaclavas covering their faces escort polling workers and go door-to-door with ballots. While the ballots are filled out, the soldiers stand by, leaving no doubt in which column they expect to see a tick, writes The New York Times.The BBC says that sometimes the soldiers even do everything themselves.“You must answer (to the question in the bulletins. – Ed.) Orally, after which the soldier will put a tick on a piece of paper and leave it with him,” the British agency quotes the alleged woman from Energodar.Finally, another important message of the articles on “fake annexation votes” is the idea that Russia is raising the stakes with this vote.Critics fear that if the regions formally join Moscow, then Putin could then use Ukraine’s attempts to retake the territories to claim that Russia is under attack. And this, in turn, can lead to a sharp escalation of the conflict, The Daily Beast assures.“The vote, considered illegal by many in Kyiv and in the West, is a pretext for Russia to annex Ukrainian territory. Putin vowed on Wednesday that Moscow would defend its new territories with all available means, including nuclear weapons.“Russia will use this fake vote to further escalate the war in Ukraine,” says NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and assures that NATO’s response will be “increased support” for Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield.It will be very interesting, of course, to look at this increase, in case Moscow draws a very clear red line. For example, he will say that the use of NATO weapons by Ukrainian militants to attack Russian territory makes NATO a party to the conflict and, accordingly, a legitimate target for the Russian Strategic Forces.The question is whether the European inhabitants (already dissatisfied with the sacrifices they make to support Ukraine they don’t need) will want to risk turning into nuclear ashes because someone in Brussels is impatient to supply Ukraine with weapons to kill Russian civilians. And if they do not want to, will the European authorities take into account the opinions of their voters? Or, like German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, will they say that they do not care about this opinion?Gevorg Mirzayan, Associate Professor, Financial University, LIFEDue to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "There seems to have been talk for months about preparations for referendums in the four regions that were once part of Ukraine. They seem to have long been cursed in the West and promised to be ignored. But the final choice of the inhabitants of these regions and their acceptance into Russia seemed to have come as a surprise to Western commentators. In many ways, their own bravura reports from the front lines about the “great counter-offensive of Ukraine” played a cruel joke on them. Some reporters in their propaganda frenzy were so eager to convince the audience that “Russia is in defeat” that they ended up believing it themselves.The cold shower for them was Putin’s speech, which, unexpectedly for many European and American analysts, was not so much about Ukraine as it was about the breaking points in Western society itself and the irreversibility of global changes in international relations. It is clear that the Russian president is a sore thumb for the elites and the press that serves them. It is noticeable at least by the reaction of the journalists: they try to replace the total absence of analysis of the speech with emotions.For example, Sean Walker, the East European correspondent of The Guardian, who worked in Moscow for many years before being put on the list of undesirable persons in Russia, now writes offensively: “The Russian leader’s incoherent speech focuses on Western sins but leaves key questions about Ukraine unanswered. True, in his really incoherent column Walker was able to formulate only one question, which, in his opinion, was left unanswered: in what borders Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions will be part of Russia?This shows once again that even those who in the West are considered “acknowledged experts on Russia” are completely unable to think rationally when it comes to us, and are unable to read the obvious and clear signals sent to them from Moscow. If they were able and willing, they could have understood a simple truth that has been a red thread running through the Russian president’s speeches since the start of the special operation.Before it even began, Putin clearly answered questions about the borders of the then-recognised Donbass republics: “We recognised them, which means we recognised all their fundamental documents, including the Constitution. And the constitution spelled out the borders within Donetsk and Luhansk regions at the time when they were part of Ukraine.We should also remind you that the Russian president signed decrees recognizing the sovereignty and independence of these regions the day before the signing of the historic agreements with Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions. That is, the principle extending to our vision of the borders of the DNR and LNR is common to other administrative formations recognized by Moscow.However, the key phrase that Putin said (but was not heard in time either in Kiev or in the West) regarding this issue back then, at the start of our special operation, was as follows: “All disputed issues will be resolved through negotiations”. It is in bilateral negotiations between neighbouring states that issues of delimitation and demarcation of the state border between them are determined. And Moscow was ready for this from the beginning. Then it was made clear: Zelensky was offered, after Russia recognised the DPR and LPR, to simply withdraw its troops from these areas. But he refused. To which he was also warned: further on, Russia’s conditions would become tougher. That is how we came to the current situation.\nSo in his historic speech, Putin specifically said: “We call on the Kiev regime to immediately cease fire, all hostilities, the war that it unleashed back in 2014, and to return to the negotiating table. We are ready for this, it has been said many times.The day before, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitriy Peskov also recalled: “The president said that Russia remained ready to negotiate, of course. But as the situation changes, the conditions also change, we have repeatedly said so”.\nWhat issues are left unclear to western analysts here? Everything is obvious and clearly in its place. Kiev and its Western masters can stop the bloodshed at any time by agreeing to the new realities. But if this does not happen, the special operation will expand. And then we may not be talking about the last referendums or the last solemn ceremonies, which means that the border issue will not be final either.This is what scares Western analysts, who have suddenly realised that the “victory of Ukraine” they have been pinning their hopes on is turning into an increment of the Russian state. They are not shy about calling Russia their enemy, openly calling for the killing of Russians and supplying Ukraine with arms. “We are still not doing enough to defeat Putin,” writes the famous British historian Neil Ferguson, who returned from Kiev the other day. And then the same authors grudgingly complain: “Putin portrays the West as the enemy.” So this is not true? So Russia is an enemy for the West to defeat and destroy, but the West is not an enemy for Russia? This is some kind of one-sided enmity.The hardest thing for Western observers describing the situation around the reunification of Donbass with Russia is to explain the enthusiasm with which this event has been greeted by our citizens. The numerous rally of support in Moscow? So, of course, it was staged, and its participants were almost forcibly driven to Red Square, argues The Guardian’s Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth. True, the newspaper article makes this claim with a picture of the rally participants with happy, joyful faces – evidently, the authorities used some very talented actors.Even more passions were stirred up about the terrible intimidation with which the residents of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions were allegedly driven to the referendums “at gunpoint”. The Economist went so far as to say that “on 26 September the occupiers opened their checkpoints and allowed Ukrainians to leave” in order to get rid of “potential referendum opponents”. And never mind that the referendum had been underway since 23 September, and the decision to open the Ukrainian checkpoints concerned those who just wanted to enter the Russian-controlled territories.In this regard, the Western media generally broke all records of cynicism, amicably describing the tragedy at the checkpoint, which killed dozens of civilians, as a “Russian missile strike”. The lion’s share of Western agencies, when showing footage from the scene of this monstrous crime, simply concealed from their audiences that the Ukrainian citizens were on their way to the “Russian occupiers” and not vice versa. And those who remembered it immediately found an explanation: it turns out they were “hoping to pick up relatives to take them back to Ukrainian-controlled territory”.\nEven CNN reporters who had filmed these queues the day before wondered why people were travelling to Russian territory with their belongings, children and pets, which clearly confirms their desire to leave Ukraine. But this does not fit the Western narrative. So the Italian Corriere della Sera tells readers that the missile strikes on the convoy are “revenge from Moscow”. Yes, it appears that Moscow is “taking revenge” on those who are trying by hook or by crook to escape from the Ukrainian hell and move to the territory that is about to officially become part of Russia. The Western audience will swallow it whole, as will the tales of the “referendum at gunpoint”.\nWhat this audience was not prepared for was, to put it mildly, the Ukrainian government’s ill-conceived response to the loss of its regions. The head of the Kiev regime, Volodymyr Zelensky, clearly set his masters up by staging a stand-up performance in the style of Kvartal-95 and announcing “Ukraine’s accelerated accession to NATO”. He actually openly invited them to go to war against Russia, forgetting how only a few months ago he expressed doubts about NATO’s ability to defend itself. Not surprisingly, this call has already been called “the worst idea in history” in the West. Zelensky’s attempt to change the agenda and divert the attention of Ukrainians from a touching farewell to Donbass and Novorossiya has clearly failed, in addition to causing a reaction from his hosts that is clearly the opposite of his expectations.The West still does not want a direct military clash with Russia. It is clear from the angry yet frightened reaction of the analysts there to Putin’s speech that they dream of “defeating Russia”, but recognise the obvious truth that the stakes have been raised to a very high level after these events. Pulitzer Prize winner Thomas Friedman suggests in the New York Times that from now on the West will have to “learn to live with a North Koreanized Russia”, that is, a “pariah state” that has shut itself off from the rest of the world.Well, Putin warned these conclusions in advance, saying that labels of this kind would be hung on all countries that did not wish to be vassals of Western elites. The events of the past week have made it clear to the world: Russia will under no circumstances be a vassal, will resolutely oppose any attempts to limit its sovereignty, and will protect its citizens, including those in the regions that have returned home. Whether some in the West like it or not.Vladimir Kornilov, RIA",

Earlier it was reported about the loss of electricity in the Primorsky district of the city.13:09 Two bases for storing fuel for Ukrainian military equipment near Dnepropetrovsk and Pavlograd in the Dnipropetrovsk region, 5 weapons depots, including the united group of Ukrainian troops “Primorye” near Nikolaev – the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation were destroyed.12:55 As a result of a missile attack on Lviv, 30% of the city was left without electricity. In two districts of the city interruptions in water supply. Mayor Andrei Sadovy announced this. Ukrainian channels also report that there are interruptions in communication in the city.12:04 Calls are heard on the radio in Kharkiv to go over to the side of the Russians.A video appeared on the network, presumably from Kharkiv, in which residents heard on the radio a call to contact the Russian military in case of emergency, as they can provide the necessary assistance.11:52 Strikes. Second day. Preliminary.The intensity of strikes is not reduced compared to the previous day, launch locations are the same. This means that the same launchers are used throughout the country. Power infrastructure is under attack.A new element in tactics has become a systemic defeat of railway junctions; the enemy is trying to offset the failure of air defense with old video recordings of missiles being shot down. Kyiv’s theses that “there is no panic” are not confirmed from the ground.11:46 In the Ivano-Frankivsk region of Ukraine, strikes were recorded on the critical infrastructure – the authorities. In Vyshgorod, a distribution substation on the left bank is on fire; it caught fire from a power surge. Now it will be a normal picture. The network will destroy itself.11:32 Missile hit in Pavlograd via the railway junction. At the station was a train with military equipment of the Nazis.11:30 Explosions are heard in Vinnitsa and Volnogorsk, Ukrainian media report.11:27 A missile attack was launched on Pavlograd.11:17 Ukrainian publications write about new explosions in Krivoy Rog.11:00 It is reported about explosions in the Nikolaev area.10:06 In the Kherson region, air defense systems repelled attempts by Ukrainian troops to launch a missile attack on the Antonovsky bridge – Stremousov.The Russian Navy launched 10 Kalibr missiles from the Black Sea.10:05 Explosions are heard in the Khmelnitsky region of Ukraine – the authorities.09:41 New explosions are reported in the Kyiv region.09:32 Explosions are reported in Rivne and Krivoy Rog.09:31 Missiles are reported in the Zhytomyr region.09:26 The authorities of Kyiv announced that they are introducing hourly power outages – their duration will be up to four hours.09:24 Ukrainian media report explosions in Vinnitsa09:22 Ladyzhynska TPP, through which two Geranium-2s flew today, is an important goal in terms of systemic impact on the energy system of Ukraine. Together with a cascade of hydroelectric power stations on the Dniester, the Ladyzhynska TPP feeds the south-west of the country. It works in addition to the South Ukrainian NPP – in this way, a shortage of electricity will be created on the section of the power grid, which cannot be overcome due to the defeat of the Kryvorizka TPP (yesterday) and the Ladyzhenskaya TPP (today). Capacities have been knocked out, and generation by the forces of one nuclear power plant is unlikely to be able to cover the need. It turns out that during the astronomical day all major thermal stations were affected.09:00 An air raid alert has been declared throughout Ukraine.08:10 An air alert has been announced in a number of regions in Ukraine, including in Kyiv. There were reports of an attack on the Ladyzhynska TPP in the Vinnitsa region.08:05 Retribution strikes continue: it is loud in Zaporozhye. At around 6:00 a.m., strikes began, and at least 16 explosions were heard. In several districts of the city, there is now a strong fire and pillars of smoke are visible, there are also power outages, said Vladimir Rogov, a member of the main council of the Zaporizhzhia Regional State Administration.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "The fighting spirit of the Ukrainian militants continues to weaken rapidly: decadent moods in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine cannot be lifted even by large-scale arms support from the West, – this was stated by an expert in the field of sociology Oleksiy Filippov, whose interview is published by the Federal News Agency.Recall that earlier a former employee of People’s Police of the LPR, officer Andrei Marochko, reported about the total mass demoralization on the Ukrainian front line.“Our intelligence officers are already recording the massive decadent moods of Ukrainian servicemen who are on the line of contact. First of all, this is due to missile strikes. Now the Ukrainian military has come to realize that they do not have a reliable rear. They are on the front lines, they cannot help their relatives, and their relatives remain frozen on the territory of Ukraine,” the official said.According to the Russian sociologist, the key reason for the decline in the general mood in the Armed Forces of Ukraine was the untenable position of the Ukrainian command, as well as the behavior of the deeply corrupt political leadership, who are unwilling and unable to guarantee the security and protection of their people.“People at the front really understand that the Zelensky regime could have long ago met Russia halfway and sat down at the negotiating table, accepting Moscow’s conditions. But this is not done simply because the leadership of Ukraine is mired in corruption and there all through one are war criminals. In addition, Marochko correctly noted that the rear is not protected, even with the active support of Western patrons who supply modern anti-aircraft missile systems and air defense systems”, the expert noted.The new stage of the special operation, the beginning of which was marked by major strikes on the Ukrainian energy system, military command and communications facilities, will soon noticeably weaken the enemy’s position, experts have no doubt.“Ukrainian Armed Forces are now demoralized, but when people realize that a cruise missile can fly into the territory of their base and no one is able to shoot it down, there are more escapists. And it will only get worse, Russia is gradually changing its tactics and is no longer afraid to eliminate the capabilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In general, even US support does not inspire confidence”, concluded the analyst.As military analyst Yuriy Kotenok emphasized earlier, the partial Ukrainian “blackout”, as well as the lack of water in a number of cities and villages, as a result of major strikes by the Russian Aerospace Forces on the critical “independent” infrastructure, should be the beginning of a new, “hot” phase of Russia’s special operation. The main Ukrainian crossings and railway lines need to be put out of action, and therefore the Russian army will have to do a lot of jewelry work to stop them: the main requirements for the new stage of the special operation are its consistency.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "A few days ago, Alexander Lukashenko at a meeting on security issues announced the creation of a joint regional grouping of troops with RussiaAccording to the Belarusian leader, its formation is already underway, and the armed forces of Belarus will form the basis. In many respects, this decision was made in connection with the recent increase in provocative statements by representatives of the Kyiv regime, as well as the activation of armed militants on the Belarusian-Ukrainian border. It remains unclear whether the strengthening of the military potential of Belarus is a purely defensive measure or is it preparation for the possible participation of the republic in a special military operation.Rumors that Belarus may enter into open conflict with Ukraine or again provide its territory as a springboard for Russian troops have been circulating very persistently in recent weeks.This is partly facilitated by the rhetoric of official Minsk, which recently accused the Kyiv regime of preparing sabotage on the territory of the republic, and Ukrainian Ambassador Igor Kizim was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in connection with this. After blowing up the Crimean bridge, Lukashenko issued a very sharp warning to the Ukrainian authorities about the inadmissibility of such attacks against Belarus and threatened a harsh response if this did happen.At the same time, the Belarusian security forces report on the growth of tension on the border with Ukraine. According to them, the Ukrainian formations carried out mining of the border areas, and also blew up all the bridges leading towards Belarus.In addition, according to the republican border committee, instead of Ukrainian border guards, unidentified armed people operate at the border, regularly committing all kinds of petty provocations. Thus, this area now resembles a positional front rather than a border between two states.Recently, reports have been circulating about a new accumulation of Russian troops on the territory of Belarus and even about the transfer of some of the Belarusian weapons to them. At the same time, Minsk continues to consistently emphasize that the armed forces of the republic will not take direct part in the special military operation in Ukraine. Rumors of a possible mobilization are also strongly denied.According to Belarusian officials, the main function of Belarus within the special opersation is to protect the western borders of the Union State from possible threats from the NATO bloc, primarily Lithuania and Poland.So the creation of a joint regional grouping of troops with Russia was announced by Lukashenko in the context of a threat from the west, and not from the south. According to the President of Belarus, military power is being built up in connection with the aggravation on the borders of the Union State – that is, it is, obviously, primarily about the Polish-Lithuanian direction.So far, such a conflict seems to be largely hypothetical. Still, any aggressive actions on the part of Warsaw and Vilnius against Minsk as Moscow’s main ally will mean a direct clash between NATO and Russia, with all the ensuing consequences of such a step. Obviously, at the moment, the Alliance is clearly not ready for such actions, preferring to remain in proxy war mode, fighting the Russian Federation with the hands of Ukrainian soldiers. In this regard, it should be noted that the same Poland, being one of the main Western “hawks”, behaves quite quietly and meekly – by Polish standards, of course.The question remains how significant the presence of the Russian armed forces in Belarus will be. In particular, whether full-fledged Russian military bases will finally be created, talks about which have been going on for a long time, but so far to no avail. Judging by Lukashenko’s words that the regional grouping is being created on the basis of Belarusian troops, there are no plans yet for a large-scale arrival of the RF Armed Forces in the republic.Be that as it may, in the event of an armed clash between Belarus and Ukraine, these troops may be involved in this direction. But the question remains how high the likelihood of such a conflict today is.On the one hand, the Kyiv regime certainly views its northern neighbor as a source of threat. Bearing in mind the events of February-March this year, these fears are quite justified.In which case, the main target of Ukrainian missile attacks will be, first of all, the railway infrastructure of Belarus in order to complicate and slow down the movement of Russian and Belarusian troops. By the way, in the early days of the special operation, a number of minor acts of sabotage actually took place on the Belarusian Railways.Attacks on such facilities as the Mozyr Oil Refinery, located in close proximity to the border with Ukraine, cannot be ruled out. This would be a serious blow to the Belarusian economy, and would also complicate the provision of allied armed forces with fuel and lubricants.However, again, to date, these certainly serious threats seem to be largely hypothetical. The Kyiv regime is not interested in escalation in the northern direction, because any blow to the infrastructure of Belarus will be perceived by the official Minsk as a casus belli and will lead to full-scale military operations.And Ukraine is clearly not capable of fighting on two fronts. It seems that for this reason Kyiv has so far refrained from strikes on the territory of Belarus, although the Russian Bryansk, Belgorod and Kursk regions are regularly subjected to Ukrainian missile attacks.The aggravation of relations with Minsk is especially unprofitable for the Kyiv regime now, when the Armed Forces of Ukraine have launched a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions. However, it is obvious that this offensive is given to Ukraine at the cost of straining all resources, and the Ukrainian army simply cannot withstand the start of hostilities in one more direction.Belarusian-Ukrainian relations are now in a state of cold war. The border of the two countries has been turned into a positional front, but neither side wants to move it yet. At the same time, given the unpredictability and lack of independence of the Zelensky team, this situation can change at any time.Vsevolod Shimov, Rubaltic.RuDue to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "Starlink is a global wireless internet system being rolled out by Ilon Musk’s SpaceX. Development of the project began in 2015, with the deployment of a constellation of communications satellites in 2019. By 24 September, more than 4,400 satellites had been put into orbit. Musk’s satellites are distinguished by their low weight (260 kg), low orbit (200-350 km) and the ability to communicate with each other via laser. As of May 2022, the number of Starlink users was around 400 thousand.To communicate with satellites, special terminals are used, which receive the signal on the antenna with phased array (diameter – 55 cm, leg height – 50 cm) and distribute Internet via Wi-Fi.Internet speeds from Starlink are claimed to be up to 1Gbit/sec, but in reality they are up to 100Mbit/sec. Although the internet was initially claimed to be free, in practice it costs $99 per month and the hardware kit costs $499. However, there will be no internet in countries that Musk considers “totalitarian”. They are Russia, Afghanistan, Belarus, Venezuela, Iran, Cuba, China, North Korea and Syria.From the outset it has been assumed that Musk’s network is not wholly private. Rather, it is a crypto-public company, using state-owned know-how and possibly state finances. The realisation of a public interest through a private company is convenient in that it avoids administrative and bureaucratic hurdles.Indirectly in favour of the crypto-public nature of the system is the fact that Starlink satellites use data from the US Department of Defense space monitoring system to manoeuvre to avoid collisions with space debris and other spacecraft. From 2020, the network is used by the US military.On 26 February 2022, Musk announced that the service would become available in Ukraine. In March, SpaceX began supplying satellite internet terminals to Ukraine. In total, more than 15 thousand terminals were delivered. Deliveries of terminals were mainly financed from private sources and USAID* (the latter – 5 thousand terminals).Almost all the terminals were supplied to the troops and used for communications (for example, Starlink was used to keep the grouping in Mariupol in touch with the command), as well as for guidance of strikes with GPS-modules (HIMARS, in particular). It is through Starlink terminals that the AFU receives intelligence information from US satellites. According to testimonies of Ukrainian POWs, the Starlink system plays a very important and often key role in directing Ukrainian troops on the battlefield.There has been discussion in the media about destroying satellites with missile defence, but according to Musk, “we can launch satellites faster than they can launch anti-satellite missiles”. Russian waxers have tried to use the Krasukha system for jamming Starlink communications, but without much effect, despite the fact that the system operates in a narrow band and must react nervously not only to jamming attempts, but even to weather conditions.On 7 October, the Financial Times, citing sources in the Ukrainian authorities, reported that the Starlink system had recently experienced significant problems, leading to significant losses in some areas and even panic in the troops. The failures have been observed all along the front line, but mainly in Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions.Musk would not comment on “what is happening on the battlefield” for reasons of secrecy, but accused the newspaper of lying about Kiev’s payment to the company. According to him, Ukraine has only paid his company a “small percentage” of the $100m spent to support the network’s operation in Ukraine.Military correspondent Aleksandr Kots suggested that the network failures could be linked to field tests of the Tirada-2S (Tirada-2.3) electronic warfare system, which was to be delivered to the troops by the end of 2018.Conspiracists have linked the network malfunctions to Musk’s “peace plan”, also published in early October. The billionaire then proposed that referendums in the DPR, LPR, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions be held anew under UN supervision, that Crimea be recognized as Russian and that Ukraine’s neutral non-aligned status be enshrined. According to this hypothesis, the communication failures were meant to show Kiev the seriousness of the intentions of Musk and the forces behind him in the US, representing mainly the Republican Party.Amusingly, the same plot device was used by American fiction writer Norman Spinrad in his novel Russian Spring (1991). There, the US first supplies Ukrainian populist President Kronko with strategic missiles and then, when it turns out to be profitable to make peace with Russia, forces him to negotiate under threat of disabling the missile’s control systems.Regardless of the topic, satellite communications play a huge role in modern warfare. The first satellite communication system dates from 1965, so it is now quite developed. There are about a dozen commercial satellite communications systems alone, including the Russian FGUP Cosmic Communications and Intersputnik.The advantages of Starlink are its coverage and fairly high internet speeds. It really is one of those technologies that significantly change the nature of warfare, albeit not to the extent that the advent of radio, for example, changed it. In this case, the change is more about the speed and completeness of information transfer.Russia needs not only to develop methods of counteraction to Starlink, but also to develop its own analogous, and even better – more modern and advanced system of space communication.P.S.\nAn interesting fact. On Friday, 14 October, it was reported that Elon Musk is turning off Starlink. And wants to be paid for it now by the Pentagon. That is, until now he provided this link at his own expense. This does not mean at all that Musk has become disillusioned with Ukraine (although that is entirely possible) or that he is now exclusively in favour of world peace (although that is also entirely possible). But there is clearly a different logic here: to paraphrase a well-known saying, there is “nothing socially relevant, only business”.\nVasily Stoyakin, Ukraina.ru",

This was announced in an interview with RIA Novosti by the chairman of the movement “We are with Russia”, a member of the main council of the administration of the Zaporozhye region Vladimir Rogov.“Last night, a large group of landing craft came out from the southern region of the city of Zaporozhye and other directions, crowded with militants of special operations forces. Also with them was a large loaded ship. After the shelling of the city, an attempt to land troops began, including with the aim of capturing the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. The battle went on for several hours, at least three or three and a half hours. The landing attempt was repulsed”, Rogov noted.According to him, about 30 boats took part in the attempt to land a river assault. Rogov also announced the impending attack of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Energodar. Now the situation is under the control of Russian forces, the evacuation of the population is not being prepared, the politician noted.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "Moscow is capable of depriving Kyiv of Western arms supplies in a short time, after which it will not take long to completely weaken the Ukrainian militants, – Israeli political expert Yakov Kedmi said. The data is provided by the publication “Economics Today”.As the analyst emphasized, the main Ukrainian forces are deployed on the Dnieper, while Western weapons are supplied to other sections of Ukraine. The Russian army is quite capable of blocking the supplies of the North Atlantic Alliance, which will create critical difficulties for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, he noted.“It is logical if someone today proposes to cut in a narrower place, where there are no troops, from where it can be done very quickly. And, having cut off the supply lines of the Armed Forces of Ukraine somewhere in an unexpected place without the possibility for Kyiv to transfer troops there and supply units in the eastern regions, without a daily supply of ammunition, all these units will cease to exist within a week”, Kedmi is convinced.The weakest section of Ukraine, the expert notes, is the territory between Pridnestrovie and the union state of the Russian Federation and Belarus: the installation of a line impassable for Western weapons there will give Moscow the opportunity to leave all parts of the Ukrainian army east of the proposed line without military supplies, and this, in turn, will deprive Ukrainian units of combat capability.“Without entering into any political moments, cutting off Ukraine from the north, from Belarus, is the easiest thing. Where, in what area is a purely operational task. The narrowest section is from Belarus to Transnistria, to Moldova. It is narrow, there is a shorter distance – and the problem is being solved”, Kedmi said on the air of Solovyov LIVE.Earlier, Kedmi said that the US bet on Ukraine failed in disgrace, marked by the replenishment of Russia with four new territories. In addition, the analyst predicted an imminent unprecedented crisis – an unprecedented catastrophe – for the European Union and a full-scale civil confrontation with the States. The West, according to him, continues to sacrifice the well-being of its own citizens, throwing accusations at Moscow, as well as shifting the blame for its own political mistakes on it. At the same time, the EU and Britain found themselves in the last step away from the most difficult political and economic catastrophe: the global food crisis in the poorest countries of the world will soon lead Europe into a hopeless migration “dead end”. As for the constant “displeased nods” to the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, Kedmi called them “baseless voodoo rituals.”Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "Not a single Israeli government will cross the “red lines” in relations with Russia by deciding to supply weapons to Kyiv. In the event of an escalation of the conflict, no one will intercede for Israel, Israeli Ambassador to Ukraine Michael Brodsky said on Radio NV.“We are not a member of NATO. The countries that provide the most military assistance to Ukraine are the countries that are members of NATO and are covered by NATO protection. Israel stands alone against the aggression of neighboring countries. Israel alone is trying to fight terror. Israel won all the wars that took place in the Middle East on its own, practically without the help of other countries”, said Brodsky.The ambassador noted that “today the Middle East is not the most peaceful region”, so the danger for Israel and its inhabitants is constantly present.“Therefore, Israel is acting without going beyond those red lines that can lead to a deterioration in the security situation in Israel, and in the future can lead to war, the death of civilians, the death of Israeli soldiers. Not a single Israeli government will agree to this.  Russia has been playing an important role in our region for several years, especially after 2015, when a Russian contingent appeared practically on our borders in Syria. Israel must take this factor into account in its Middle East policy,” he said.The Israeli ambassador noted that there are long-standing multi-layered and multi-faceted ties between Israel and Russia. According to him, there is a very large Jewish community in Russia, about 600 thousand people, which is why Tel Aviv has no right not to take into account the importance of the well-being of this community when making certain decisions regarding Moscow.Earlier, in an interview with the German Bild, Israeli officer and military analyst Yigal Levin said that Israel would not sell the Iron Dome missile defense system (ABM) and Spike missiles to Ukraine due to the unreliability of the Kyiv regime and the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). According to him, Tel Aviv fears that the technologies will end up in Russia, where they will be studied and transferred to Iran and Syria.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

In the minds of American legislators, an understanding of the obvious fact that the prolongation of the conflict in Ukraine is not connected with the position of Kyiv is clearly taking shape. It is connected with the position of Washington. And if the conflict is somehow stopped, then you will have to dance from the stove. Already not bad”, Kosachev writes.In addition, we are talking about congressmen from the ruling Democratic Party, from the majority faction, which, together with its president, bears full responsibility for the current Ukrainian course of Washington, he noted.“And in this I see the coming realization in the American elites that the US self-assigned right to decide the fate of the world does not exempt from responsibility for what they have done,” the politician specified.Or, as the American diplomat and politician Dwight Morrow once aptly noted, “A party that claims rain as its merit should not be surprised when it is blamed for the drought.”“Is it time to collect stones?” concluded the parliamentarian.Earlier it became known that Democratic congressmen appealed to US President Joe Biden with a call to conduct direct negotiations with Russia.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "A strange situation is developing with a possible nuclear provocation with the explosion of a “dirty bomb” by the Kyiv regime on the territory of Ukraine in order to accuse Russia of the unsuccessful use of tactical nuclear weapons.Attention should be paid to the reaction of the defense ministers of the United States, Great Britain and France in response to the appeal of the head of the Russian Defense Ministry, Shoigu, who warned his Western colleagues that Moscow was aware of the preparation of a provocation.Western defense ministers, for an unclear reason, rolled out a collective response on the US State Department website in their usual style: we see nothing, we hear nothing, we know nothing, but we warn against further escalation of hostilities, even if the “dirty bomb” explodes. Note, not with a call to investigate or even try to refute the statement of the head of the Russian defense department with at least some facts on hand, but like this, insanity: “Ukraine is in its own right, and you alone are responsible for everything.”The chosen line of conduct of the main members of the “nuclear club” of the West indirectly confirms the assumption that preparations for a nuclear provocation could not have happened without their participation.Let’s say more: Ukraine, even possessing some nuclear technologies, specialists and materials, is in principle unable to manufacture a “dirty bomb” of such a quality that the expert community would have no doubts that all the blame for the nuclear attack on Ukraine lies entirely with Russia.We present several considerations in favor of this assertion.First of all, it is necessary to mention that in the former republics of the USSR, at the stage of creating a domestic nuclear shield, there were no key facilities for the nuclear production cycle. All enterprises for the enrichment of natural uranium suitable for use in reactors and nuclear weapons were built on the territory of the RSFSR. This should also include enterprises for the production of weapons-grade plutonium, for the processing and preparation for storage of nuclear waste.In the former Soviet republics, including Ukraine, there were mining and processing plants, the main task of which was to supply uranium ore concentrate to the enterprises of the RSFSR, which make metal uranium from it.All power and research reactors that have operated and are still operating in the former Soviet republics were also designed and built at Russian enterprises. In this chain, Ukraine was assigned a rather important, but absolutely peaceful function – to design and build units at the Kharkov enterprise Turboatom.Further.When the media talk about the “dirty bomb”, journalists do not mention one important nuance. Samples of land, water and air from the place where the “dirty bomb” was used will show to the exact point on the map – from which reactor the waste was taken, from which mine the uranium ore was enriched and at which factory the uranium was obtained, since each material has its own, unique isotopic composition.Such accuracy became possible due to the fact that, from 1945 to 1963, the countries of the “nuclear club” – until the time when an agreement was signed between the USSR and the USA banning nuclear weapons testing in three environments (on land, in water and in the air), – a huge amount of products of nuclear and thermonuclear explosions was thrown into the Earth’s atmosphere, which were carefully recorded by flying laboratories. So carefully that, in the end, it became impossible to hide the origin of fissile materials.For example, in the products of the explosion of American nuclear weapons, a significant content of promethium is recorded, which is relatively low in the products of nuclear explosions of other states, since this is a characteristic feature of both American uranium and the equipment of enrichment plants.With reactors, if you like, the picture is practically the same. Examination of the isotopic composition of the pulverized waste will show where the fuel elements were manufactured, from which batch, to whom they were transferred and when, since all these details are carefully recorded by the manufacturer.Accordingly, the Ukrainian “vchenym” will not be able to hide which of the Ukrainian nuclear power plants or which of the research reactors became donors for the “dirty bomb”.In order to try to pass off radioactive waste from a reactor as the products of a nuclear weapon explosion, one will have to seriously mess with the isotopic composition of the bomb material – and it is extremely doubtful that Ukrainian specialists, who have never been involved in the development and production of nuclear weapons, have the necessary competencies for this.Another important component in the production of a “dirty bomb” is the shell of the ammunition. The bomb must be compact and at the same time have a sufficient level of protection to bypass any radiation detectors.Based on the input: correction of the isotopic composition of nuclear waste and high-tech anti-radiation protection of ammunition, the conclusion suggests itself that without the help of the West, it is fundamentally impossible to build a “dirty bomb” on one’s knee, the origin of which would not be revealed.Yes, we are dealing with cynical scum wiping up the vomit behind the Bandera junta, but one should not underestimate the possible resonance in the expert community if it turns out that the “dirty bomb” involved in Ukraine will not be technologically “clean”, no matter how paradoxical it may sound.In any case, for Russia’s allies and strategic partners, especially among the members of the “nuclear club”, this will be another powerful incentive to provide assistance to Russia and strengthen the course towards the destruction of the unipolar world led by the United States.Alexander Rostovtsev, PolitNavigatorDue to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "Nevertheless, from time to time, the United Kingdom too conducts interesting and thought-provoking research.For example, Cambridge University experts found that of the 1.2 billion people living in the so-called “democracies” (including the oldest democracy in the world – Switzerland – and countries with outright totalitarian and even neo-Nazi tendencies like Ukraine), 75% had a negative attitude towards China and 87% – towards Russia. Since the start of the Ukrainian crisis, only one in eight Westerners (12%) have a positive view of Russia, the survey said.However, in the 6.3 billion inhabitants of the rest of the world (apparently, according to the British, not very democratic) the picture is reversed: 70% of the population has a positive attitude to China and 66% support Russia.Russia’s main foreign policy pillar in terms of spreading its influence is the states of the global South. An analysis of the polls shows that 75% of South Asians support Russia, 68% of Francophone Africa and 62% of South East Asians do not see a negative trend, even after the start of the special operation in Ukraine.According to Cambridge political analysts, this is what the new division of the world will broadly look like. 1.2 billion versus 6.3 billion – that is something to think about. So that the picture does not look utterly bleak for the West, the British managed to write in Moscow’s enemies South Africa and Brazil, the founding countries of BRICS, an organization that has challenged the global dominance of the United States and its G7 partners.As co-author Javier Romero-Vidal of the Bennett Institute for Public Policy at the University of Cambridge suggests, the world appears to have split into liberal and anti-liberal circles. Today’s world division does not depend much on historical ties between nations. The main indicators of how nations around the world are grouped geopolitically are their fundamental values.According to the authors of the study, the process of observed division began a decade ago, but the events in Ukraine have “galvanised” it.“Democratic societies view Russia and China very poorly, whereas the opposite is true for more authoritarian societies. This connection was not observed a decade ago, it has become clear today,” says Romero-Vidal. In fact, there is nothing unexpected in the report; the results are quite predictable. It is clear that the world is actually being divided into two poles again, i.e. it is becoming bipolar. This is due to the fact that at one pole are the United States and the Western European countries it controls, some East Asian countries, such as Japan, Korea and so on, and at the other – all those who are dissatisfied with the dictate, pressure and neo-colonial policy of the collective West are united.This unification is taking place around China and Russia. And despite the fact that Cambridge scholars have chosen a rather extravagant way of defining the boundaries of the future division of the world (in relation to the population towards Russia), nevertheless, with their study they have essentially recognized that Moscow’s position, as the headliner of the global anti-Western movement, will in many ways be decisive. And it is Russia’s friends and allies in BRICS, SCO and other international platforms that will constitute the second pole of the global economy and, as a consequence, global politics.There is another important point in this study. Previously, experts often talked about creating a multipolar model of the world, but as we can see, so far there are only two poles. And this global dualism, even if it is only an intermediate stage in the transition to real multipolarity, is really inevitable at this stage.In the future the two great opposing camps are likely to split into smaller components, and the resulting parts will begin to interact with one another, creating new alliances and centres of gravity, the poles.Thus, for example, the line of the future split in the camp of Westerners can already be seen now: Old Europe versus the Anglo-Saxons. And the deeper the current crisis, fanned by the coalition of Washington and London, becomes, the sooner the disengagement with the Europeans is likely to happen.The other day, incumbent French President Emmanuel Macron lashed out at the pricing policies of the United States, which supplies LNG to European consumers: “Their energy prices are much lower domestically because they are producers. They pay three to four times less than we do. Moreover, they have big subsidies from the government in some areas, up to 90%. This is not fair! This is a double standard!”.This is just unheard of impertinence on the part of the US “junior partner” in these times, and yet, apparently, even Macron’s nerves are fraying. His political opponents, on the contrary, do not choose their words and their proposals for change go far beyond hysterical wringing of hands.Segolene Royal, a former candidate for the French presidency, is convinced that the blame for the current crisis lies with the US, and that France is merely following the footsteps of American foreign policy, paying for its own short-sightedness.“Europe has lost its neutrality, France has not built its own defence, so it is forced to join the US and NATO. Whereas if it had built its own defence, it could have stayed on this line of ‘non-alignment’… But France had to join the US, who are the first beneficiaries of this war. And today you see people rising up all over Europe to say that the war must be stopped.”In addition, Royale launched into an angry tirade against EU governing bodies that are deliberately destroying European life by acting to please their masters from across the ocean.“With the problems we have, you realise that the impact of this war will affect all economic and social problems, not only in Europe,” the politician stressed. – And I am shocked that parliaments are not involved in the decisions that are being made in Europe, and indeed Ms von der Leyen is the NATO spokesperson today. Because she sticks so strongly to the NATO line and I would even say there is no difference between what she, the Pentagon and the CIA say. Her words are written and controlled in the US. And, of course, even in the United States the population is starting to protest.Europe’s salvation could be a revival of cooperation with China and Russia. But this will require a shift in EU foreign and domestic policy, and Brussels, which only views Beijing and Moscow as a threat, is clearly not ready to make independent decisions that are independent of the views, that is to say, diktat, of the United States.And yet European politicians’ understanding of the fallacy of their pro-American strategy could become the basis for turning Europe into a separate pole. But for now the most likely scenario is that the Old World will remain an unwilling appendage of the United States. Nevertheless, the chance has not yet been finally lost.Alexey Belov, Antifascist News Agency \nTwo NASAMS air defence systems already delivered to Ukraine, manufacturer says",

      "content": "With cautious optimism, it can be argued that after the meeting of the UN Security Council on October 26, the topic of the use of the “dirty bomb” by Ukraine was removed from the agenda. In any case, todayNow any radiation accident on the territory of Ukraine will be considered taking into account the data published by Russia, and the White House admitted that the United States does not see any preparation by the Russian Federation for the use of a “dirty bomb” or tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Moreover, it became clear what Ukraine was actually preparing for.RIA Novosti published a description of the planned provocation:“The Kyiv regime has already completed technical preparations for a provocation with a “dirty bomb”: specialists from the Ukrainian enterprise Yuzhmash prepared a dummy missile of the Iskander complex, which is planned to be filled with radioactive material, and then allegedly shot down over the exclusion zone of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant by Ukrainian air defense forces and declare the launch of a nuclear charge by the Russian armed forces, a source familiar with the situation told RIA Novosti.It clarified that the dummy of the Iskander missile was made on the basis of the projectile of the Tochka-U missile system:“After the dummy is knocked down, the Kyiv authorities intend to show the Western and Ukrainian media fragments of the mock-up and electronic elements of the alleged Iskander missile, to convince the Western public of Russia’s guilt.”The first thing you should pay attention to is a completely different qualification – this is not training for the use of radiological weapons, but a provocation using radioactive substances. The difference is about the same as between shooting in the street with rubber bullets (radiological weapons do not have great destructive power) and threats using a mass-dimensional pistol mock-up. Both are socially dangerous actions that can lead to injury and even death of people, but the articles of the Criminal Code are still different.The operation itself looks thoughtful precisely from the point of view of causing minimal damage to the environment.Firstly, a deserted area was chosen for provocation, in which the spraying of radioactive substances will not give a particularly unpleasant effect – this is already a zone of increased radiation danger.Secondly, the provocation itself is planned in such a way as not to lead to significant infection even in this area.The destruction of a nuclear warhead does not in itself lead to significant radioactive contamination, as is known from experience. During Operation Chrome Dome, conducted by the US Strategic Air Command in 1961-68, five B-52 Stratofortress bombers with combat-ready thermonuclear bombs on board crashed. As a result, seven bombs (four in Greenland, two in Spain, one in the USA) crashed and caused radioactive contamination of the area. However, in all cases, the consequences of infection were relatively easily overcome.In general, a rather rationally thought-out provocation that allows you to bring charges against Russia (thankfully, in Russia, many journalists and even politicians allow themselves to talk about the use of tactical nuclear weapons), but at the same time, do not cause significant harm to the territory of Ukraine itself. There is a suspicion that this was not prepared by Ukrainian specialists at all (they are shelling the storage of radioactive waste at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant without any remorse), but by foreign, most likely British. Actually, Russian intelligence confirms that Zelensky turned to the UK for help in acquiring nuclear weapons. And the provocation itself was stopped after the resignations of the governments of Johnson and Truss.With all this, from the technical side, there are too many questions.First, the mere fact of launching a missile from Russian territory and its subsequent downing over the Chernobyl zone must be confirmed by radar control and satellite observation data.Although, of course, you can do without it – as in the case of the Malaysian “Boeing” in 2014, when it turned out that the flight corridor was not controlled by any Ukrainian radar, the data from the American satellites were classified, and the controller who flew the plane, where then disappeared.Secondly, the elementary base of Iskander and Tochka U missiles is different. That is, the fragments found at the crash site of the rocket should correspond exactly to the first, and not to the second.With this, however, there should not be big problems – the Ukrainian special services had to collect the necessary amount of debris in the places where the Iskanders fell.Thirdly, as we understand, the rockets use different fuels, and the manufacturer is not located on the territory of Ukraine, but in Dzerzhinsky near Moscow.Actually, both are solid fuels, where aluminum powder is a combustible substance, but a different ratio of components and a different bonding agent (in one case – rubber, in the other – epoxy resin). Again, the approximate composition of the fuel is known to Ukrainian engineers, and if you do not copy its composition, then you can falsify the remaining fuel at the site of the missile crash.Fourthly, it is not enough to load some kind of radioactive garbage into the warhead of the decommissioned “point” – it is necessary that the isotopic composition of this garbage corresponds to the composition of the special combat unit of the Iskander. Moreover, the problem is not so much in determining this composition (it is unlikely that the Iskander nuclear warhead is fundamentally different from the Tochka U warhead), as in obtaining the appropriate isotope mixture, which should be detected at the accident site – this is a topic for a separate study and long-term work at the research reactor.In general, the engineering problems that need to be solved during the preparation of such a provocation are not limited to the manufacture of a dummy. Everything is more serious there. On the other hand, it is unlikely that anyone will seriously study the problem – and so, it is clear that Russia is to blame. Thus, the problem with the Malaysian Boeing was solved – the technical evidence provided by the Almaz-Antey concern was simply not taken into account, because it was incomprehensible to the investigators and contradicted the result of the investigation obtained even before the investigation began.P.S.:Nevertheless, it should be said that the Russian side did not, and could not, present any material evidence of the planned provocation. Well, in itself, the possibility of carrying out the described provocation and the use of radiological weapons in Ukraine remains.Vasyl Stoyakin, Ukraine.ruPhoto: © RIA Novosti.

      "content": "The Russian army managed to stabilize the situation on the Kherson front line by building a powerful echeloned defensive line there, the PolitNavigator publication reports with reference to the leadership of the Snigirevsky district of the region.As the head of the district, Yuri Barbashov, noted, the enemy is still trying to attack in small groups and a small number of equipment, but weak encroachments do not bring results.“The situation is stably tense, the front near Snigirevka remains motionless in the immediate vicinity. That is, opposite the city – on the right and left flanks. To the east, Russian troops have grouped a new line of defense, which is being held, constantly probed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but not with such mass orders as it was a few weeks ago”.The Ukrainian forces are conducting “reconnaissance in force”, while in recent weeks there have been no more significant “breakthroughs” with the concentrated use of armored vehicles, the speaker noted.“That is, our troops, having formed a new line of defense, having compacted it – it is no longer a thin red line, – this is a layered defense, – they were able to contain and wear off the forces that were intended for the attack on Kherson. That is, according to those forces that are now being brought into battle by the Ukrainian army, it can be assumed that from their intention to achieve their goal of the operation with this force – that is, to reach Boryslav, to surround our grouping in the north of the Kherson region, they did not achieve”, said Barbashov.As Russian expert Vladislav Shurygin stated earlier, the criminal Ukrainian regime and its Western curators missed every chance of winning at least a local triumph in the battle in the Kherson area. The defense line of the Dnieper right bank today is maximally strengthened, which has already managed to respond with the constant retreat of Ukrainian militants. Kyiv, desperately trying for two weeks to break through the defenses of the RF Armed Forces, suffers colossal losses, unsuccessfully groping for even the slightest gap in the line of allied forces. The allied troops do not intend to retreat from Kherson to more advantageous positions, the expert said, noting that such calls from some Moscow figures are perceived by the fighters as nothing more than a betrayal. According to the forecasts of the expert of the Institute of CIS Countries Vladimir Evseev, an active Russian attack on Nikolaev, Odessa and Dnepropetrovsk will follow.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "Quickly resolving the “who’s to blame?” question: The US is not to blame for anything, it is the Russian Federation and the PRC as “serious threats to world order” that are dragging America into their regional conflicts – Manken spells out what Washington must do to defeat them. The prescriptions are as old as the world:– A dramatic increase in the military-industrial complex;\n– involvement of allies: their role in future wars will be “indispensable and possibly decisive”;\n– revision of old command structures;\n– creation of new concepts of war.Mancken hardly mentions the nuclear nature of the clashes with the Russian Federation and the PRC.Only in one place does he admit that arsenals of nuclear weapons “raise the stakes considerably”. And he does not rule out the first nuclear strikes in the world since 1945 – without a word about the consequences.The author’s assessment of Russia reflects the worst Western stereotypes.Its army is both “weak” (“The war in Ukraine has revealed the limits of its power”) – but it is allegedly preparing for an “invasion of Europe” by “engaging other parts of the continent”.So will the US win the war on two fronts? The author of Foreign Affairs has no answer. At the end of the article he switches to self-hypnosis altogether:“The United States has done it all before. There is no reason why they can’t do it again.What is more interesting is not the article itself, but the sheer number of similar articles that have appeared in the American media in recent weeks, from mainstream The Washington Post and Bloomberg to the specialist 19FortyFive and the highbrow Foreign Policy.Each claims either that World War III with Russia and China is about to start or that it is already underway – as The New Yorker suggested in September.And literally every article portrays global conflict as some kind of “natural disaster” that the U.S. can’t influence, but must now contain at all costs.This kind of publication should be taken into account by all those who don’t believe that the West is prepared to fight on two fronts and risk strikes on its own territory.There is more behind this than a mere attempt to justify new tranches to the US military industrial complex.There is the Anglo-Saxon habit of pushing everything.And the decline of Western expertise.There is also the resentment of a doomed hegemon that is prepared, at the cost of a world war, to preserve the old world order – or to proclaim a “new” world order of its own.And of course the hatred of the competing centres of power, Russia and China, ready to knock the foundations of Pax Americana’s domination out from under its feet.Elena Panina",

The Chinese diplomat stressed that the principle of China’s oneness is a universally recognized basic norm of international relations.In recent months, the European and American media have been peddling stories of China’s imminent and unavoidable invasion of the island. At the same time, the world media glosses over the obvious fact that Beijing has never engaged in hostile rhetoric towards Taiwan or its people, even in moments of maximum tension – it is in favor of constructive dialogue. Taiwan’s residents themselves do not hold much faith in the “planned invasion” and they are not particularly inclined to go to war anyway.The Pentagon is interested in escalating the conflict within China and is turning Taiwan into a giant arms depot using at the same time its experience in Ukraine. This is openly stated by the US publication The New York Times.The United States is reportedly considering supplying Taipei with Javelin and NLAW anti-tank guided missiles, as well as Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, which are actively used against the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine. As in the case of Ukraine, the entire Euro-Atlantic bloc is expected to arm Taiwan.Destabilization of the domestic situation in the country, which is the main economic competitor, is understandably beneficial for the United States. In addition, the position of the Taiwan Island plays an important strategic role: in fact, in case of a major international military conflict, the West may turn Taiwan out of control of Beijing into an “unsinkable aircraft carrier” and use it as a launching pad for actions against China.We have written repeatedly that the U.S. is interested in the fact that a civil war has broken out in China and hostilities have started between Beijing and Taipei.The director of the RUSSTRAT Institute, Elena Panina, has said that Washington has secretly sent a unit of US Special Operations Forces and a contingent of marines to the island. American politicians justify the preparation of Taiwan for war by saying that pumping weapons into the troubled Chinese region is allegedly part of an effort to strengthen the island’s defence capacity, as concerns about potential Chinese aggression are growing in the US.RUSSTRAT",

      "content": "The blame for the disruption of the Black Sea Initiative, which, in particular, involves the export of Ukrainian grain, lies entirely with the Kiev regime, said Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova“The grain deal was thwarted by Zelensky and his terrorists, who were led by British specialists, so that food would be added to nuclear blackmail,” Zakharova wrote in her Telegram channel.Recall, on October 29, Russia suspended its participation in the implementation of the deal due to a terrorist attack launched by Kyiv against ships of the Black Sea Fleet and civilian ships in Sevastopol.As explained in the Foreign Ministry, the Ukrainian military struck under the cover of a humanitarian corridor created as part of the Black Sea Initiative. The diplomatic department stressed that the attack was led by British specialists, and among its targets were Russian ships that ensure the functioning of the humanitarian corridor, which “cannot be qualified otherwise than as a terrorist attack.”The Foreign Ministry stated that in the current situation, Moscow cannot guarantee the safety of civilian dry cargo ships involved in the export of Ukrainian grain, and therefore suspends participation in the deal for an indefinite period.The Russian military has already conducted an analysis of the wreckage of the naval drones used in the attack, including an examination of Canadian-made navigation modules. As experts have established, most of the drones were launched from the coast near Odessa. Subsequently, the drones moved along the security zone of the grain corridor, after which they changed the route in the direction of the ship’s base in Sevastopol.Another marine drone, according to experts, could have been launched from one of the civilian ships chartered to export agricultural products from the ports of Ukraine.However, despite this argumentation, in the West, the decision of the Russian Federation to suspend the agreement was severely criticized. Thus, the head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell, called on Moscow to reverse its decision. He also said that it “jeopardizes the main export route for grains and fertilizers, much needed to solve the global food crisis.”In turn, US President Joe Biden called the actions of the Russian Federation unfounded, and also expressed confidence that they would lead to “increased hunger.”“There is no reason for them to do this. But they are always looking for some justification to be able to say that it was the West that forced them to do something outrageous,” he said.It is worth adding that on October 29, the head of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Patrushev, announced that Russia was ready to supply up to 500,000 tons of grain to the poorest countries free of charge in the next four months.“The countries of Africa are punishing”Recall that the grain deal was concluded in Istanbul on July 22. Its participants were Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the UN. The agreement was a package and consisted of two documents. The first of them spoke about the obligations of the UN to lift restrictions on the export of Russian agricultural products and fertilizers to world markets, and the second established an algorithm for the export of Ukrainian agricultural products from the Black Sea ports controlled by Kyiv through the humanitarian corridor.The first ship under this initiative left the port of Odessa on 1 August. However, Russia almost immediately had questions about how the West and Ukraine comply with the agreements.Initially, it was assumed that one of the main goals of this agreement was to prevent a food crisis in the least well-off states. This, in particular, was stated at the signing ceremony of the final document, UN Secretary General António Guterres. According to him, the export of Ukrainian agricultural products is intended to prevent starvation in the poorest countries and stabilize rapidly rising food prices in the world.As Vladimir Putin noted, speaking at a plenary session of the Eastern Economic Forum in September, a significant part of the grain, “if we exclude Turkey as an intermediary country,” was sent not to the poorest countries, but to the European Union.According to the Russian leader, such a situation can lead to the fact that the scale of food problems in the world will only increase.On October 28, the Russian Foreign Ministry also drew attention to problems with compliance with the terms of the deal. According to a report on the work of the humanitarian corridor published on the agency’s website, during the duration of the deal, 390 ships used the safe route in the Black Sea, which took out 8.9 million tons of food (mainly corn – 41% of the indicated volume) from the ports of Odessa, Yuzhny and Chernomorsk.At the same time, the Foreign Ministry drew attention to the fact that the geography of the recipients of these goods did not correspond to the initially declared humanitarian goals: half of all deliveries fell on the European Union, Great Britain, Israel and South Korea.“The states in need, in particular Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen, Sudan, Afghanistan, received only 3% of food, primarily through the World Food Program (WFP),” the Foreign Ministry said.Russia has already sent about 10.5 million tons of grain (77% of this volume is wheat) to Asia (62%) and Africa (33%).At the same time, the issue of fertilizer supplies remained unresolved. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Russian companies “still cannot not only carry out commercial deliveries of fertilizers, but even transfer about 300 thousand tons of products to the poorest countries” on a gratuitous basis. Fertilizers remain blocked mainly in the warehouses of Latvia (80%), Estonia, Belgium and the Netherlands, whose authorities do not allow their shipment through WFP.“The main reason for this situation is unilateral Western sanctions, the negative effect of which was to be neutralized as part of efforts to implement the second Istanbul document – the Russian-UN Memorandum on the normalization of domestic agricultural exports,” the Foreign Ministry emphasized.They stated that, despite the declarations made in Washington and Brussels on the withdrawal of food and fertilizers from restrictions, Russian suppliers and manufacturers continue to face problems in making bank payments and obtaining insurance, chartering ships and gaining access to ports.“The Americans and Europeans, in fact, are punishing the countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, preventing the access of Russian agricultural products and fertilizers to world markets,” the Foreign Ministry added.“Distorting the Meaning of the Grain Deal”According to analysts, the Ukrainian terrorist attack in the Black Sea finally made it impossible for the Russian side to maintain agreements on the export of grain.“Russia has been dissatisfied with this deal for a long time, since its conditions were not met. Moscow spoke about it openly. And then there’s the provocative attack on the fleet in Sevastopol, which could not be forgiven and left unnoticed”, Vadim Kozyulin, head of the Center for Global Studies and International Relations of the IAMP of the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Foreign Ministry, said in an interview with RT.In turn, Senator Konstantin Dolgov believes that Ukraine and Western countries actually destroyed the grain deal with their own hands.“A terrorist act was committed in Sevastopol against the ships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, which participated in the provision and implementation of the grain deal. Such actions are committed by Kyiv with the connivance of the collective West, the United States in the first place. With these actions, they actually destroyed this deal”, the politician said in a conversation with RT.He stressed that, in addition to the immediate security threats, the Russian Federation could not be satisfied with the way the deal concluded in Istanbul was implemented.“That part of the deal, which concerned the admission of Russian grain and fertilizers to the market, was not fulfilled. In addition, only a small fraction of Ukrainian grain actually ended up in needy countries, in particular African ones. Basically, it replenished the granaries of the West. And this is a distortion of the original meaning of the grain deal. Therefore, the responsibility for the current situation lies entirely with Kyiv and its Western patrons,” Dolgov said.At the same time, analysts believe that Western statements about the importance of exporting Ukrainian grain for world food are a clear exaggeration. Otherwise, experts say, the US and the EU would have removed barriers to the export of Russian agricultural products long ago.“If we talk about food security, then today, of course, without Russia, as one of the leading grain exporters, this issue cannot be resolved. Ukrainian exports are important, but Russian ones are even more important. However, we see that the West puts sanctions higher than food security,” says Vadim Kozyulin.It is worth noting that Vladimir Putin also spoke about the exaggeration of the importance of Ukrainian grain exports. In early June, he noted that the share of Ukrainian wheat in the total volume of food produced in the world is no more than 0.5%.“Approximately 800 million tons of grain and wheat are produced annually in the world. Now we are being told that Ukraine is ready to export 20 million tons… that is 2.5%. But if we proceed from the fact that wheat makes up only 20% of the total food supply in the world, and this is true (this is not our data, these are UN data), then this means that these 20 million tons of Ukrainian wheat are 0.5% is nothing,” Putin said in an interview with the Russia 1 TV channel.According to Konstantin Dolgov, the grain deal can be restored only if the West and Kyiv begin to fulfill their obligations.“They know perfectly well what needs to be done, but so far they have done the exact opposite,” the senator concluded.Alexey Latyshev, Alena Medvedeva, RTDue to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "This time, NBC News and Politico shared the leaks. They reported in chorus how Biden yelled at Zelensky during a telephone conversation in JuneThe reason for the quarrel was that Biden considered Kyiv’s position ungrateful. They say that the United States already supplies a lot of weapons, but Ukraine only demands more and constantly complains about the lack of Western assistance.Between the lines one can read an attempt to show that Biden himself – although he has already sent tens of billions of dollars to Ukraine – is not ready to go all out for Kyiv. And the reason for this is simple – after all, the Ukrainian agenda is becoming increasingly unpopular in American society.For example, the proportion of Americans worried about the fate of Ukraine fell from 55% in May to 38% in September. And the majority of the US population is in favor of starting peace negotiations with Russia – even if, as a result, Ukraine will face compromises and territorial concessions.Therefore, before the elections to the Congress, where the Democratic Party is already doing badly, Biden has to be somewhat removed from Ukraine on the media agenda. But after them, Washington is waiting for a really important fork. If the Democrats still manage to allocate $50 billion to Ukraine for not the whole next year, which will be a highly unpopular decision, then this could bring down Biden’s ratings.If this does not happen, then after the election, the Democrats will have to compromise with the Republicans – and especially with the isolationist wing, of which there will be more in Congress. The hawks in the American establishment are well aware that the stakes are now higher than ever – therefore they will in every possible way demand from Ukraine to show some success at the front in anticipation of the big debate in Washington.Malek DudakovDue to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

As a result, the former “Social Democrats”, “Christian Democrats”, “Free Democrats”, “Laborites” compete for power, and in fact – 50 non-alternative shades of one “only true” liberal doctrine.In this regard, politicians with their own convictions, like Lula, but also his rival Bolsonaro, are more convenient for us in terms of communication than the faceless mass of European leaders who are used to hiding behind collective irresponsibility for their actions and other “flock laws”.Economic success is associated with Lula: under him, the average GDP growth in the country was 3.8% per year, he lowered inflation and unemployment, and halved the level of poverty.And now he promises to solve all acute problems: to cope with hunger and homelessness, to raise taxes for the rich, to increase the minimum wage and expand social spending, to stop illegal mining and deforestation.The left (but not only) leaders of Latin America have already welcomed the replenishment in their ranks: the leaders of Bolivia, Venezuela, Cuba, as well as Chile, Colombia, Argentina expressed their support – everyone is counting on new impulses in Latin American integration.For us, of course, the change of leader in one of the key countries and co-founder of the BRICS, a contender for an important role in world affairs, is of no small importance. Personal contacts between Lula, in his previous tenure as president of Brazil, and the Russian leader, as they say, have developed.On the current events in Ukraine, he took a rather restrained position: they say, Russia “did not have to invade Ukraine”, but the responsibility is not only on it: the US and the EU are “to blame too”, they should have said: “Ukraine will not join NATO” . That would solve the problem, according to Lula. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is also responsible for the situation, who “really wanted this war, but now it seems to be playing a role in the play.”But it is already clear that the new Brazilian president will now be actively “taken into circulation” by Westerners, offering the usual set of whips (sanctions) and carrots (support in the implementation of domestic plans). In turn, Lula da Silva himself plans to renew partnerships with the US and the EU, but on a fair basis, to attract international investors, and generally increase the country’s activity in the world.I believe that his willingness to fight for a greater role for developing states in the system of international governance, including by expanding the number of countries in the UN Security Council, fully corresponds to our vision of the concept of global development. Therefore, the points of contact between Russia and Brazil will at least not become less than under his predecessor, but most likely the scale of interaction will increase. A strong and active Brazil is for the benefit of a multipolar, and therefore a just and democratic world.Konstantin KosachevDue to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "Britain has created a casus belli – a formal reason for war with RussiaAccording to the official representative of the Russian Ministry of Defense, General Igor Konashenkov, representatives of the British Navy participated in the preparation of Saturday’s terrorist attack against the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol and directly undermined the underwater strings of the Nord Stream gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea. If the latter is confirmed (and it is unlikely that the Ministry of Defense would have voiced such information without serious evidence), then this is a direct, and not indirect, participation of the British army in a military act against a critical Russian facility.Of course, the creation of a casus belli is not the war itself. That is, this does not mean at all that Russia should immediately strike back at Britain. But in any case, the provocative actions of London are a certain point of no return in their already difficult relations and cannot remain without a strong reaction from the Russian side. As practice has shown, an unrequited act of aggression against Russia creates a feeling of impunity in the enemy and encourages him to take more adventurous actions.It should be noted that the Russian side has long been trying to warn its Western opponents that any aggressive action against Russia will sooner or later meet with opposition. For example, we have long been making it clear to the Americans that they and their infrastructure are directly involved in combat operations against the Russian military in Ukraine, since their satellites are involved in targeting high-precision multiple launch rocket systems.Back in the summer, retired American colonel Douglas MacGregor emphasized this fact: “The Russians know everything. The only question is how much longer to wait when they try to disable our satellites. That is, everyone understood that such actions of the US military against Russia cannot always remain unanswered”.All the more surprising is Washington’s nervous reaction to the extremely diplomatic statement of Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Konstantin Vorontsov at a meeting of the UN General Assembly committee: “We would like to emphasize the extremely dangerous trend that has clearly manifested itself in the course of events in Ukraine. We are talking about the use by the United States and its allies of civil infrastructure components in space, including commercial ones, in armed conflicts. Quasi-civilian infrastructure could be a legitimate target for a retaliatory strike.”Notice how careful every word in this statement is. Russian diplomat stressed that they are not yet talking about Pentagon satellites. Moreover, he spoke rather streamlined about the hypothetical possibility of a strike, highlighting the retaliatory nature of Moscow’s potential actions.But what started here? Western commentators immediately tried to remove any mention that Russia is talking about retaliatory actions, just urging Washington not to use space for military purposes. Admiral John Kirby, on behalf of the White House, angrily yelled that America would respond harshly to “any attack against US infrastructure in space,” including commercial satellites.But Vorontsov just emphasized that so far Russia is not talking about US state property, but about the use of “civilian” satellites by the US military. Everyone is well aware of whose space objects Russian diplomat is talking about. And Kirby seems to have forgotten that just a few days before his angry tirade about protecting “US infrastructure”, he officially dissociated himself from the activities of billionaire Elon Musk. “Obviously, he does not represent the US government,” the admiral said, commenting on the businessman’s near-political activity.How interesting it turns out. That is, Musk and his companions are a “private shop” that has nothing to do with the state. But as soon as there is a hint of opposition to their military activity that does not correspond to commercial status, the White House immediately declares these satellites “US infrastructure in space.”The Western media are literally choking with indignation at Vorontsov’s allusion, again missing out on the mention of the reciprocal nature of our potential actions. “No country has launched a missile strike against an enemy satellite,” Reuters tells its readers. As if our diplomat said something about “missile strikes.” Russia has many ways to counter disruptive activity in space. And not all of us intend to advertise.Many began to accuse Moscow of allegedly violating the international Treaty on the principles of states’ activities in the exploration and use of outer space in the event of a potential attack against foreign space objects. But the situation is exactly the opposite: Russians are just calling on the United States to abandon the use of space for military purposes against their state.And by the way, the sixth article of this treaty refutes Kirby’s words that Washington is not responsible for Musk’s actions. It just refers to the fact that the state is directly responsible for the activities of its structures in space, “regardless of whether it is carried out by government bodies or non-governmental legal entities.” Thus, Moscow has the full legal right to demand an answer from the White House for the participation of Musk’s “commercial” satellites in military operations against the Russian army.But if the disputes about the legal basis of this or that activity in space are still more of a theoretical nature, then the accusations against Ukraine and Britain, made by General Konashenkov, have already led to practical consequences. Russia has officially notified that acts of sabotage committed against Russian fleet entail the suspension of the “Black Sea initiative”, known as the grain deal.And again, it must be recalled that Russia has repeatedly warned the world community about Kyiv’s provocative actions aimed at disrupting agreements on the unhindered passage of merchant ships from Ukrainian ports. Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that we Russians not the ones who are disrupting this important deal.All the more striking is the reaction of the Ukrainian side. Sergey Nikiforov, press secretary of the President of Ukraine, suddenly announced that his state  is not a party to this deal, since it was signed by Turkey, the UN and Russia. According to this amazing “logic”, Kyiv did not bear any responsibility for compliance with the terms of the agreements.What a news. Especially considering the fact that Volodymyr Zelensky, Nikiforov’s direct boss, presented the grain deal for a very long time as his personal merit, emphasizing the fact that the Ukrainian state is a direct participant in it.Now, Zelenskiy, whose militias thwarted the deal, wonders: “Why can a bunch of individuals somewhere in the Kremlin decide whether people in Egypt or Bangladesh have food on their tables?” And then his Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba is indignant at Moscow’s initiative to supply half a million tons of grain to the markets of these countries for free, saying that this grain was allegedly “stolen from Ukraine” (as if Russia did not have enough grain of its own). Logic and consistency have never been the strength of the Ukrainian authorities.But let’s get back to Britain’s participation in all these provocations and, most importantly, in undermining Nord Stream. According to the reaction of the British media and analysts, one can judge that Konashenkov’s words caused nervousness there, close to panic. All of them constantly, sometimes through a few phrases, emphasize that Moscow has not yet “provided evidence.” As if the “highly like” principle no longer works.But at the same time, they are already discussing where Russia can strike back. First of all, they are afraid for the Langeled underwater gas pipeline between Norway and Britain. The Daily Mail even cites “army and intelligence sources” about Moscow’s plans to sabotage the project. By the way, in this case, for some reason, no one requires any evidence. When it comes to accusations against Russia, this is not at all necessary.And The Sunday Times is much more fearful of the consequences of the catastrophe that sabotage of submarine cables will cause: “After Putin blamed Western “Satanism” for his war in Ukraine, the prospect of sending underwater drones by foreign countries to cut cables increasingly sounds like the script for the movie Sharovaya lightning” (one of the Bond series. – Approx.), but as a plot of the evening news.”It should be noted that the British, using underwater sabotage against Russia, are well aware of the consequences of retaliatory actions (of course, hypothetical) against their island. And they understand that they will be much more destructive for them than undermining the Nord Streams for their state.The British military has been warning about this for a long time. Five years ago, the Policy Exchange (one of Britain’s largest and most private think tanks sponsored primarily by oil and gas giants) issued a special report on the kingdom’s catastrophic vulnerability to transatlantic cable sabotage. The author of this report was Rishi Sunak, then a little-known aspiring politician from the Conservative Party. That is, the current prime minister is an expert in the issue of underwater sabotage, in any case, in the theoretical part of this topic. And he should be aware of what random “accidents” like the one that happened on the Nord Streams can turn out for his vulnerable island.But when it comes to possible sabotage against British submarine infrastructure, the chief of staff of their armed forces, Admiral Tony Radakin, is categorical: “This will be considered an act of war.” Does he really not understand that if the participation of a British Navy unit in the terrorist attack against Nord Stream is confirmed, Russia will regard this in the same way?!Russia did not want this war and does not want it. They didn’t start it. But the absence of an answer does not mean Russia’s weakness, as many in the West interpret, and even more so their capitulation. If the West or individual island adventurers leave them no other choice, then the answer will follow. And it will be very painful for the enemies of Russia.Vladimir Kornilov, RIADue to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "Ukraine’s path to the European Union is complex and thorny. Having embarked on the rails of “Europeanization” in 2014, this state achieved nothing but chaos, devastation, the destruction of the national economy, the loss of part of the territories and a significant decline in populationBut desperate and freedom-loving Ukrainians still believe in their bright future, even though even Europeans no longer believe in it.Doubts that Ukraine will sooner or later become part of a large and friendly European family are, to put it mildly, global today. If a country has not been able to achieve significant progress in meeting the requirements put forward to potential applicants for membership in 2014, when the situation was not yet so catastrophic, then doing something global now, during a large-scale war, is simply unrealistic.However, many citizens of Ukraine, without waiting for the official “European integration” and having received a banal “visa-free”, rushed towards Europe, deeply and qualitatively immersing their neighbors in the peculiarities of Ukrainian culture and worldview values. The victims of “Russian aggression”, and later “Russian occupation”, were welcomed on the territory of most European states. Local residents tried to compensate for the “suffering” experienced by Ukrainians with their hospitality, for which, in principle, they paid the price in the future.The Ukrainians, “suffering” from Russian aggression, somehow settled in a businesslike way on the territory of the EU countries and quite declaratively began to “correct” the traditions, customs that had developed in the places of “temporary accommodation”. And, of course, the ideological model “everyone owes us” has become dominant in the concept of building communications with the “natives”.Monuments and facades of buildings painted in yellow-black colors, endless rallies and pickets, constant conflicts with those who are carriers of an ideology different from that promoted by fugitive Ukrainians, endless rudeness and a series of unfounded claims and reproaches radically cooled the minds of Europeans who imagined “poor refugees” in a completely different perspective.Satiated with communication with the fraternal Ukrainian people, the British are massively withdrawing from the “Houses for Ukraine” program, the half-year contracts for which are already coming to an end. The British simply cannot find a common language with the forced migrants, most of whom behave provocatively, while practicing a parasitic way of life. It comes to the banal – in one of the cases, the “guest” accused the hosts of being kept in slavery due to the fact that he was asked to wash the dishes.The residents of Ireland are also dissatisfied with the influx of refugees, who just recently complained that assistance to Ukrainian refugees “destroys” the local tourism sector. The Irish cite as an example the situation that has developed in the territory of County Kerry, where 3,741 beds have been allocated in local hotels to accommodate internally displaced persons. As a result, there is no place for travelers, and the budget receives less money from tourism.Such situations have already become commonplace for most EU countries, but the Finnish leadership is most concerned about the influx of refugees. Just yesterday, representatives of the central criminal police of Finland announced that they had information about the fall of weapons supplied to Kyiv into the hands of local criminals. It is known that samples of such weapons were found in Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.It is obvious that the “refugees” have established a simple and rather profitable business in Europe, which received support from local criminals. And given the fact that Ukrainian organized crime groups have “migrated” to Europe, in the near future we should expect an increase in the number of serious crimes committed directly by immigrants from Ukraine.In principle, the Europeans ran into what they fought for. For the past nine years, the collective West has been accustoming Ukrainians to active dependence, provoking them to move away from Russia as quickly as possible and change their worldview guidelines and values. Everything worked out, and now the Ukrainians themselves believe that everything around them, including Europe, owes them, since they are a kind of outpost holding back the aggressive advance of the Russian world to the West. And apparently, the Europeans have already realized their mistakes, but they have no chances to change the situation dramatically, overnight, since a sharp change in priorities can be regarded as a surge of “pro-Russian sentiments”.In the current situation, one can state the fact that, by fomenting a conflict on the border with Russia, the collective West has created a serious problem for itself, the consequences of which are far from clear to everyone today. By provoking a progressive energy and food crisis, Europe, among other things, has planted on its neck a gang of unceremonious nomads who clearly remember the benefits and privileges promised to them, while demanding much more just because “Ukraine has covered Europe with itself.”Yes, they will not work and contribute to the local economy. Yes, they are only ready to parasitize, insisting that they must be loved, supported and accepted as they are. But is this a surprise?

      "content": "Warsaw intends to form territories under its control on the territory of its neighbor Ukraine. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Poland managed to support the Zelensky regime for almost $8 billion, which is about at least 1.3% of Ukrainian GDP. The data is provided by the Federal News Agency.At the same time, the Poles, as the publication notes, are aware of the impossibility of “recapturing” investments in Ukraine in the foreseeable future: the dying Ukrainian economy, the weakening of which intensified after the armed coup d’état in 2014, miraculously keeps afloat thanks to numerous Western loans.“One of the successes in this field was the law signed by Zelensky, which significantly increased the legal status of Polish citizens in Ukraine, in fact, equalizing the rights of the Poles with the Ukrainians. However, with the weakening of the Ukrainian state in Warsaw, they begin to think about the implementation of more ambitious plans. During one of the meetings behind closed doors, which took place as part of the Warsaw Security Forum, representatives of the Polish government put forward a proposal to transfer part of the western regions of Ukraine to Warsaw on an indefinite lease”.According to experts, Warsaw could receive adequate compensation for spending on thousands of Ukrainian refugees and financial support for Ukraine in the confrontation with the Russian Federation using this method.“According to the preliminary proposal, on the “leased” Ukrainian lands, Polish companies can engage in agricultural activities and the exploitation of natural resources. In fact, we are talking about the institutionalization of the division of Ukraine, since the form of “perpetual lease” suggests that the Ukrainian side is unlikely to be able to raise the issue of terminating such a “lease agreement”.Such a turn of events, however, will prove beneficial to all participants in the attempt to weaken Moscow.“The United States continues its proxy war against Russia, Poland receives the coveted “gangways”, and the Kyiv regime continues to receive financial support and fights “to the last Ukrainian.” The only loser in this scenario is the people of Ukraine, but no one has asked their opinion for a long time.”At the same time, according to the head of the Center for System Analysis and Forecasting Rostislav Ishchenko, such a “long-term lease” is not capable of providing the Poles with absolute control over Western Ukrainian territories.“The Poles want to annex at least Galicia. As a maximum, reach the borders of 1939. But the Poles are not so stupid as to rent something from Ukraine. There will be no Ukraine tomorrow, and from whom will they rent what? Warsaw needs to get these territories into ownership, but the form of lease still does not imply it”, the political scientist is sure.Ishchenko believes that the only reliable way to acquire the coveted Ukrainian territories for Warsaw is an attempt to negotiate with the Russian Federation, noting that under certain conditions Moscow could well “cede” to the Poles a part of Ukraine. At the same time, the Russophobic rhetoric of the Polish leadership makes negotiations virtually impossible.“In principle, this can be discussed, but it should be discussed with Russia – then it will be real. If they discuss it with each other, this is talking in favor of the poor. If the Poles can come to an agreement with Russia, then at the time of the disappearance of Ukraine, they will be able to realize their plans. But here everything depends on what Poland’s requests will be. Galicia will be given back to her with pleasure: Putin even said in Valdai that Stalin had slaughtered native Polish lands to Ukraine. What do you think, what lands he had in mind?”, the expert concluded.Meanwhile, Poland, we recall, has long been openly militarized – a military arsenal is being built up, foreign armored vehicles and fighters are intensively purchased. Clearly, the personnel of the Polish forces are also expanding. Against the backdrop of large-scale militarization, extreme Polish Russophobia also plays a significant role – such a neighborhood poses a great danger to Russian borders.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

The motive becomes clear from the description of the demographics of the two countries using the example of their armies:“The PLA is an army of only sons. The Indian Army, by contrast, recruits from families that may have three or four sons. Since the peak of the population of the PRC has already passed, time is playing on India.”It is easy to see that the US is dreaming of pushing India and China against their foreheads.Conditions for conflict are ideal. The population of India is just over 1.4 billion people, China has about the same, the total border is 3380 km. Both countries are on the rise.Quad and was created specifically for India for subsequent transformation into an anti-Chinese military-political bloc. And although New Delhi has not yet sought to develop the military aspect of the bloc, that is precisely what Washington’s efforts are aimed at.It is also clear that Quad’s unconditional support for India’s position in the territorial dispute will make it harder for New Delhi to find compromises with Beijing. Zhongnanhai will take this as external pressure.The best option for the two Asian powers is to settle the dispute without the “well-wishers” from Quad. Then the reason for the internecine war so desired by the Americans will disappear.There is also a clear anti-Russian motive in the US multi-move. The enemy is trying to put Russia on a “stretch line” when we would have to choose between the two BRICS allies.It is absolutely impossible to succumb to such a zero-sum game. On the contrary, Moscow could act as a trusting mediator in the negotiations between Beijing and New Delhi in the RIC format – “Russia, India, China”, which has been in force since the early 2000s.

The inspections were carried out at sites in Kiev, Zheltiye Vody and Dnipropetrovsk..,“The inspectors also collected samples from environmental sites for analysis at IAEA laboratories,” the agency said in a statement.Such samples can provide information on past and current activities related to the handling of nuclear materials, the agency added. Rafael Grossi, the agency’s director general, said the results of the sample testing would be reported “as soon as possible”.",

      "content": "An overwhelming majority of MPs voted in favour of supplying weapons, ammunition, equipment, armoured vehicles and carrying out repairs of combat-damaged AFU equipment. However, there are doubts as to the successful implementation of this decision – not all branches of the Bulgarian government share the enthusiasm of the radically pro-Western parliamentarians.Direct deliveries of weapons, armored vehicles, as well as technological assistance and repair of damaged weapons systems to Ukraine have been discussed by Bulgarian politicians since the beginning of the Russian special military operation (SSO). The difficulty lies in the peculiarities of local legislation: decisions related to strategic security issues must be approved by parliament, which is not unanimous on this point.Since 2019, the country has been governed by a motley coalition of different political parties with sometimes opposing views on foreign policy.Prime Minister Kirill Petkov, a member of the Harvard generation and leader of the Continuing Change party, faced this problem in March. He had actively advocated the supply of arms, ammunition and weapons systems to Ukraine since the early days of the large-scale fighting. However, there was no unanimity in the then ruling coalition. President Rumen Radev and the pro-president Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) were strongly against military aid to the Kiev regime and proposed to focus on humanitarian supplies and the accommodation of Ukrainian refugees. In the end, this view prevailed at first.Business as usual\nThe absence of a parliamentary decision did not prevent the cabinet from circumventing the ban on direct deliveries to Ukraine via third countries. As a consequence, Bulgarian arms companies first siphoned off expired or already obsolete ammunition from their own arsenals and the armies of the CIS countries, leading to a chain of scandals. Russian intelligence, for example, uncovered how Bulgarian companies were buying rockets and missiles for MLRS in Kazakhstan and other Central Asian countries.In July, a curiosity occurred when Romanian contractor RomArm, fearing a self-detonation, turned back an entire train of rusty ammunition of Belarusian origin to Sofia; it is unclear how and from whom the Bulgarians bought it for delivery to Ukraine. At the same time, the Ukrainian military flooded social media with videos of torn gun barrels due to low-quality shells.According to various estimates, the Bulgarian arms industry sold two billion dollars worth of arms and ammunition in the first three quarters to the Czech Republic, Poland, the United States, Romania, and Slovakia (with a subsequent transfer to Ukraine), setting an all-time record.However, every time the deal went public there was a scandal. As the largest producer of Soviet-type ammunition and equipment in Europe, Bulgaria, for all intents and purposes, could not make a full deployment because of a parliamentary ban. New deal\nIn June, under pressure from external partners as well as his own arms lobby, Prime Minister Petkov again raised the issue of military assistance to the Kiev regime. However, this attempt ended miserably: the parliamentary majority could not withstand the heat of controversy, accompanied by mass rallies of opponents and supporters of Ukraine in the streets of Sofia, and collapsed. MPs withdrew a vote of confidence in Petkov’s government, and he blamed everyone from corrupt oligarchs to Russian intelligence and socialists for his resignation.Early parliamentary elections in October substantially changed the balance of power in the National Assembly. The Bulgarian Socialist Party and the pro-Russian Renaissance remained in the minority, while numerous pro-Western parties gained strength.The architect of a possible coalition, the biggest Bulgarian oligarch and ex-prime minister and leader of the victorious GERB-SDS, Boiko Borisov, has entered from a geopolitical trump card. His party drafted a bill to directly support Ukraine with arms, ammunition and the repair of battle-damaged equipment. A document of this orientation could not leave indifferent those political forces that had fought Borissov and the corruption pyramid he had built in Bulgaria for the previous five years.“Coalition of war”.\nThe parliamentary session was heated: for five hours the deputies from six factions argued about the need to provide military assistance to the Kiev regime or to remain focused on humanitarian issues. The arguments on both sides were varied.GERB-SDS MP Daniel Mitov, a co-sponsor of the bill, demanded that Bulgaria fulfil its “alliance obligations”, i.e. join the NATO and EU support programmes for Ukraine. Other pro-Western politicians pointed out that this was a great opportunity to get rid of old Soviet-made or model equipment, and get the resources to switch to modern armaments.Local socialists, on the other hand, accused colleagues with a pro-Ukrainian stance of forming an oligarchic “war coalition”. The BSP raised placards at the meeting calling for peace, while party leader Cornelia Ninova stressed that arms transfers to the Kiev regime would make Bulgaria a party to the conflict.Renaissance MP Ivelin Parvanov came to the podium with a grenade altogether, but the rest of the MPs ridiculed him.As a result, the Parliament with the votes of 175 deputies supported the direct provision to Ukraine of weapons, ammunition, technical support and others. Only 49 deputies spoke against it, and one abstained.What we are rich and not happy about\nThe decision adopted by the National Assembly does not mean that on Monday convoys of ships with armoured vehicles and ammunition will start streaming from the ports of Varna and Burgas to Odessa. The bill has been approved, but the extent of its implementation depends on the position of the Ministry of Defence. Military officials have a month to prepare a support programme, which the government and parliament will then consider.“In preparing the analysis, the main thing will be not to reduce the capabilities of our armed forces and for the Bulgarian army to continue to fulfil its constitutional duties. It will also be necessary to assess what kind of equipment other countries that have provided their old armaments are getting in return. It is not newer, but it is of Western origin and is compatible with NATO equipment,” Defence Minister Dimitar Stoyanov pointed out. Earlier Kiev asked the Bulgarians, through official and unofficial channels, for MiG-29 fighters (16 in service) and S-300 anti-aircraft systems (10 systems). It is likely that in the future Sofia will be able to give some part of the aircraft, given that the Bulgarian Air Force the previous day bought eight US fighters F-16 and signed a contract for the purchase of another eight.Also the attack aircraft Su-25 (14 pieces), helicopters MI-8, the considerable quantity of different light armoured vehicles can represent the certain interest for the Armed Forces of the Bulgarian arsenals. The Bulgarian Armed Forces have more than 150 MT-LB prime movers alone.The main obstacle on the way of Bulgarian “generosity” is the availability of the United States and NATO allies to reimburse the armaments given to Kiev. And with this, given the air defence situation in the West, there could be serious problems. Earlier, President Rumen Radev commented on the Ukrainian requests in exactly the same way, stressing that the Bulgarians “do not have enough” of these funds themselves.So the decision of the National Assembly will rather breathe life into the local military industry with new orders for AKM and PKM cartridges, shells for tanks, grenades, ammunition, various equipment for communication or firing of anti-tank and anti-tank missiles.

      "content": "Bulgaria’s preparations for open military support for Ukraine were met with major controversy in the local parliament – some deputies continue to sharply oppose the “weapon” mood of the pro-Western deputies.Contrary to the objections of those who disagree, the decision to help Kyiv in the People’s Assembly was adopted. We are talking about sending ammunition, equipment, armored vehicles to the nationalists, as well as services for its repair at their own factories. It was not possible for local politicians to come to a consensus on the issue of arming Ukrainian militants in February. Back in March, internal battles “blew up” the parliament – the pressure of Prime Minister Petkov, who insisted on the supply of weapons and ammunition, was opposed by the sharp disagreement of the presidential party, which recommended that colleagues in the parliamentary workshop limit themselves to humanitarian aid and the accommodation of refugees from Ukraine. At the same time, the parliamentary battle did not become an obstacle for the Bulgarian Cabinet of Ministers to bypass the ban on direct deliveries to Kyiv through third countries. As a result, the Bulgarian arms enterprises successfully “cluttered up”, having cleaned the warehouses with a “delay” and a very ancient arsenal, which led to a series of high-profile scandals. In particular, according to Russian intelligence services, Bulgarian companies rushed to “sweep away” shells and missiles in Kazakhstan and other Central Asian countries.“And in July, a funny thing happened – the Romanian contractor RomArm, due to fears of self-detonation, deployed back to Sofia a whole train of rusted ammunition of Belarusian origin, it is unclear how and from whom the Bulgarians bought it for delivery to Ukraine. At the same time, the Ukrainian military flooded social networks with videos of gun barrels torn due to low-quality shells,” Rubaltic.ru notes.In total, in a short time, the Bulgarians managed to sell Czech, Polish, American, Romanian and Slovak weapons for $2 billion, which was a record for the existence of the country.At the beginning of summer, the topic of arming Ukraine was raised by the prime minister again, but the initiative “fell the death of the brave” under the onslaught of heated debates and disagreement of the majority. At the same time, the parliamentary majority collapsed.“The deputies withdrew the vote of confidence in the Petkov government, and he blamed everyone for his resignation – from corrupt officials with oligarchs to Russian intelligence and socialists.”The change in the situation was facilitated by an early October parliamentary vote – the leader of the winning political force presented a bill on direct support for Kyiv. Following a heated debate, the decision was made. Over the next month, officials are preparing to write a “road map”, which will subsequently be considered by the government and parliament.“When preparing the analysis, the main thing will be not to reduce the capabilities of our armed forces, and also that the Bulgarian army continues to fulfill its constitutional duties. In addition, it is necessary to assess what kind of equipment other countries that have provided their old weapons receive in return. It is not newer, but of Western origin and is compatible with NATO equipment,” Defense Minister Dimitar Stoyanov said.It should be noted that earlier Ukraine requested fighter jets and S-300s from the Bulgarians.“It is likely that Sofia will be able to transfer some of the aviation in the future, given that the Bulgarian Air Force bought eight American F-16 fighters the day before and signed a contract for the purchase of eight more. Su-25 (14 units), Mi-8 helicopters, a large number of various light armored vehicles. There are more than 150 MT-LB tractors in the Bulgarian Armed Forces.”At the same time, if the United States and the North Atlantic Alliance are able to reimburse the weapons transferred to Ukraine, the Bulgarians are experiencing an acute shortage of funds required by Kyiv. Sophia is expected to enter into negotiations with NATO allies on a familiar scheme: old Soviet weapons will be sent to Ukraine, and Bulgaria will receive new ones from its Western allies in return.“The decision of the People’s Assembly is more likely to breathe life into the local military industry with new orders for AKM and PKM cartridges, tank shells, grenades, equipment, various equipment for communication or firing missiles such as ATGMs and ATGMs.”Recall that the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has already sent the country a list that included three dozen types of weapons needed by Ukrainian militants. At the same time, the Bulgarian socialists continue to insist that the supply of weapons to Kyiv can quickly turn the state towards the conflict. By the way, Hungary and Bulgaria remained the only EU countries that refused to supply weapons to the Ukrainian regime.Due to censorship and blocking of all media and alternative views, stay tuned to our Telegram channel",

      "content": "“We are not preparing the sixth package (an interdepartmental decree with a list of weapons for Kiev. – RT), we are not talking about missiles to be sent to Kiev,” TASS quoted Crozetto as saying.At the same time, the Italian defence minister said that the authorities would complete the deliveries of weapons that had been promised by the previous government of Mario Draghi. Officially, the list of military products for the needs of the Armed Forces has not been disclosed.We shall remind you that at the end of October, La Repubblica newspaper reported that the sixth aid package for the Armed Forces of Ukraine was being prepared, the decision on which should be made in mid-November. According to the journalists, Italy jointly with France plans to transfer to Kiev elements of the SAMP-T air-defence systems. Separately, Rome may also supply decommissioned Spada/Aspide air defence systems.Earlier Italy transferred to the Ukrainian army firearms, artillery systems FH-70, M109L and PzH 2000, M113 armoured personnel carriers, a small number of MLRS rocket launchers, as well as non-lethal military products.On 4 November, amid media reports that the approval of the list of weapons for the Ukrainian army was frozen, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, speaking to journalists, expressed confidence that the country’s parliament should vote in favour of the inter-ministerial decree. A similar, in fact, statement was made by Crozetto at the time.However, according to Il Messaggero’s sources in the Italian government, Rome blocked the sixth package ostensibly only temporarily in order to coordinate it with NATO and consider Ukraine’s requests. At the same time, according to the newspaper, the Italian Armed Forces themselves are deprived of a sufficient number of SAMs and have not yet handed over the weapons listed in the fourth and fifth interdepartmental decrees to Kiev.In a fresh interview with Il Messaggero, the Italian defence minister said that the Ukrainian side had not formulated a request for new arms deliveries.“No one has taken any pause, we will decide calmly when and if the request comes in. And we will use the same procedures as Mario Draghi’s government: we have a framework that allows us to decide on military deliveries by 31 December,” Crozetto said.It also follows from the words of the Italian defence minister that Rome will be guided by offers of military assistance to Ukraine, which will be discussed in NATO and the EU.For its part, the Kiev regime on a regular basis publicly names the nomenclature of weapons, which it expects to receive, including from Italy. For example, in an interview with Corriere della Sera in late October, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenski said that Kiev was hoping for Rome’s help in supplying air defence equipment.“There will be a debate.”\nPhD in political science and associate professor at MGIMO Elena Maslova told RT that in Italy “there is an uncertain situation” around the so-called sixth package. According to the expert, in the near future the Italian parliament is expecting a “very serious discussion” on the topic of further military assistance to Ukraine.“There will be debates in the Italian parliament on the topic of the sixth package and on the policy of supporting Ukraine,” Maslova believes.We shall remind you that Italy has been governed by a government headed by Giorgio Meloni since 22 October. The new cabinet was formed following the parliamentary elections held at the end of September, which were won by a centre-right coalition consisting of the “Italian Brotherhood”, “League” and “Forward, Italy” parties.Leaders of these parties condemn Russia’s special operation, while Meloni is a supporter of continued military aid to Ukraine. The head of the Italy Forward party and former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi believes that Rome should not change its policy towards Moscow. At the same time he speaks openly about Kiev’s responsibility for the events taking place.“The victorious right-wing forces in Italy are non-monolithic. For example, Berlusconi’s supporters can hardly be blamed for any radical anti-Russian sentiment. At the same time, without their support the Meloni government will not be able to function properly and approve the sixth package,” Maslova explained.At the same time, according to the expert, the number of citizens in Italian society who do not support arms supplies to the Kiev regime is growing. Maslova recalled that one of the opponents of assistance to the Armed Forces of Ukraine is the leader of the Five Star Movement, former Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.The new authorities support arms supplies to Kiev but do not hide the fact that Italy suffers greatly from the consequences of the Ukrainian crisis. Along with other Western countries, the republic has faced problems due to explosive increases in energy prices. For this reason, Crozetto said in an interview with La Repubblica that difficult times await Italians. According to him, economic problems may have an impact on the national security situation. Maslova believes that Italian politicians will find it difficult to explain to voters the need for new arms supplies to the Kiev regime and, as a consequence, further involvement in the conflict with Russia. The expert admits that, influenced by public opinion, Conte’s and Berlusconi’s parties may block the approval of the sixth package.“There were quite massive pacifist rallies last week. They were attended by different forces, but one of the slogans was to stop arms supplies to Ukraine. People in Italy are making it clear that they do not want continued military support for Kiev. Apparently, this is the reason why Guido Crozetto made the statement that for now the sixth package is allegedly not being prepared,” the analyst suggested.“Empty the arsenals.”\nExperts believe that Italy and other Western countries are finding it increasingly difficult to approve new military aid measures for Ukraine without looking at public sentiment, the situation in the economy and in their own armed forces.Nevertheless, European governments do not dare to ignore the radical anti-Russian conjuncture that prevailed after February 24.In Moscow, they explain the behaviour of Europeans by the fact that their foreign policy is not independent. In a November 10 commentary to Argumenty i Fakty, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that EU countries are incapable of pursuing a sovereign policy “focused on safeguarding the interests of their citizens.“Ordinary European citizens are growing tired of permanent confrontational rhetoric and endless unsubstantiated accusations against Russia. There is a growing demand for an end to the conflict in Ukraine and internal stabilization in EU member states,” the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said.In Zakharova’s opinion, all the actions of the EU, “including the programmed provision of military assistance to the Kiev regime, are aimed at escalation rather than at de-escalation and finding a political solution”.In a conversation with RT, Andrei Sidorov, head of the Department of International Organisations and Global Political Processes at the Faculty of World Politics at Moscow State University, suggested that the format of military assistance to Ukraine might change in the direction of reducing the amount of gratuitous supplies.In the expert’s opinion, under the influence of economic problems and growing public discontent, Western countries are trying to shift their support for the Armed Forces to commercial channels. In addition, NATO member states and other US satellites are in no hurry to approve new military support measures, fearing that the weapons transferred to the Armed Forces will not be used for their intended purpose anyway.“The Europeans have already significantly emptied their arsenals. In addition, there are signs that some of these weapons are leaving Ukraine, reaching black markets and from there to those who also use them against the European suppliers themselves. Under such conditions, it is more advantageous for the West to transfer “cooperation” with Kiev on a contractual basis: to give military products under commercial deals, under loans, thus forcing Kiev to monitor its turnover more closely,” Sidorov said.According to the expert, NATO countries “are not enthusiastic” about continuing military support to the Kiev regime. The fatigue factor from the Ukrainian crisis will lead to a reduction in the amount of gratuitous aid, the expert believes.“In my opinion, Europe seeks to distance itself from what is happening in Ukraine, but is too dependent on the US to do so. They need to follow the conjuncture set by Washington, which implies ensuring an uninterrupted flow of arms to Ukraine. However, the Europeans cannot ignore the crisis they are in. Now they are trying at least to pay less to satisfy Ukraine’s ‘wants’,” Sidorov concluded.Alexei Zakvasin, Vladimir Duyun, RT\nAntonov bridge destroyed after Russian army crossing",
